before henry morrison flagler built his railroad a former american civil war major named nathan boynton first set eyes on the area that now bears his name boynton hailed from port huron michigan he was so impressed by the natural beauty of the year-round sunshine and pristine beaches he built the famous boynton hotel where he also spent winters with his family the first settlers whom boynton had brought along from michigan soon realized that many fruits and vegetables thrived in the fertile climate pineapples tomatoes mangoes and citrus fruit were packed in crates and shipped by the ton on the newly built florida east coast railroad to satisfy the appetites of hungry americans across the country major boynton died on may 27 1911 in port huron but the hotel lasted until 1925boynton beach was founded on september 26 1898 when byrd spilman dewey and her husband fred s dewey filed the original plat in the dade county courthouse for the town of boynton{7] the town was incorporated in 1920 as the town of boynton the name "boynton beach" was first used by a community that broke off from the town of boynton in 1931 in 1939 that community changed its name to "ocean ridge" while the town of
