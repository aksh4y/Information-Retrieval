broadcasting{5]{6]{7]{8]{9] the total number of staff is 35402 when part-time flexible and fixed contract staff are included{10]the bbc is established under a royal charter{11] and operates under its agreement with the secretary of state for culture media and sport{12] its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee{13] which is charged to all british households companies and

the marconi factory in chelmsford took place in june 1920 it was sponsored by the daily mail's lord northcliffe and featured the famous australian soprano dame nellie melba the melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the british public's attitude to radio{16] however this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications by late 1920 pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority the general post office (gpo) was sufficient to lead to a ban on further chelmsford broadcasts{17]but by 1922 the gpo had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests{18] and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3000 members{19] anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the united states the gpo proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures to be known as the british broadcasting company ltd john reith a scottish calvinist was appointed its general manager in december 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast{20] the company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of bbc wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers to this day the bbc aims to follow the reithian directive to "inform educate and entertain"{21]from private company towards public service corporation 1923 to 1926{edit]the financial arrangements soon proved inadequate set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets{22] by mid-1923 discussions between the gpo and the bbc had become deadlocked and the postmaster-general commissioned a review of broadcasting by the sykes committee the committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the bbc's immediate financial distress and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the gpo this was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired the bbc's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence as was the prohibition on advertising the bbc was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 1900 and required to source all news from external wire servicesmid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the crawford committee by now the bbc under reith's leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with reith keen that the bbc be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise the recommendations of the crawford committee were published in march the following year and were still under consideration by the gpo when the 1926 general strike broke out in may the strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the bbc suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis{23]the crisis placed the bbc in a delicate position on one hand reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the bbc at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the bbc were to step out of line but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently the government was divided on how to handle the bbc but ended up trusting reith whose opposition to the strike mirrored the pm's own thus the bbc was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing the resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the pm had broadcast to the nation from reith's home using one of reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment or that the bbc had banned broadcasts from the labour party and delayed a peace appeal by the archbishop of canterbury supporters of the strike nicknamed the bbc the bfc for british falsehood company reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from blake's "jerusalem" signifying that england had been saved{24]while the bbc tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers jean seaton professor of media history and the official bbc historian has characterised the episode as the invention of "modern propaganda in its british form"{23] reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself{25]the bbc did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and it was followed by the government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the crawford committee (1925xe2x80x9326) that the british broadcasting company be replaced by a non-commercial crown-chartered organisation: the british broadcasting corporation1927 to 1939{edit]television pioneer john logie baird televised the bbc's first drama the man with the flower in his mouth on 14 july 1930 and the first live outside broadcast the derby on 2 june 1931{26]{27]the british broadcasting corporation came into existence on 1 january 1927 and reith xe2x80x93 newly knighted xe2x80x93 was appointed its first director general to represent its purpose and (stated) values the new corporation adopted the coat of arms including the motto "nation shall speak peace unto nation"{28]british radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the bbc reith an intensely moralistic executive was in full charge his goal was to broadcast "all that is best in every department of human knowledge endeavour and achievement the preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance"{29] reith succeeded in building a high wall against an american-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue there was no paid advertising on the bbc; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets highbrow audiences however greatly enjoyed it{30] at a time when american australian and canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball rugby and hockey the bbc emphasized service for a national rather than a regional audience boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing but the bbc was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games regardless of their popularity{31]bbc versus other media{edit]george v giving the 1934 royal christmas message on bbc radio the annual message typically chronicles the year's major eventsthe success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the bbc and well established media such as theatres concert halls and the recording industry by 1929 the bbc complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting because they feared it harmed the artist "by making his material stale" and that it "reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer" on the other hand the bbc was "keenly interested" in a cooperation with the recording companies who "in recent yearsxc2xa0 have not been slow to make records of singers orchestras dance bands etc who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless" radio plays were so popular that the bbc had received 6000 manuscripts by 1929 most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: "day in and day out manuscripts come in and nearly all go out again through the post with a note saying 'we regret etc'"{32] in the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at st george's hall langham place by reginald foort who held the official role of bbc staff theatre organist from 1936 to 1938; foort continued to work for the bbc as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide followingexperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930 using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by john logie baird limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934 and an expanded service (now named the bbc television service) started from alexandra palace in 1936 alternating between an improved baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line marconi-emi system the superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year{33]1939 to 2001{edit]television broadcasting was suspended from 1 september 1939 to 7 june 1946 during the second world war and it was left to bbc radio broadcasters such as reginald foort to keep the nation's spirits up the bbc moved much of its radio operations out of london initially to bristol and then to bedford concerts were broadcast from the corn exchange; the trinity chapel in st paul's church bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945 and in the darkest days of the war in 1941 the archbishops of canterbury and york came to st paul's to broadcast to the uk and all parts of the world on the national day of prayerthere was a widely reported urban myth that upon resumption of the bbc television service after the war announcer leslie mitchell started by saying "as i was saying before we were so rudely interruptedxc2xa0" in fact the first person to appear when transmission resumed was jasmine bligh and the words said were "good afternoon everybody how are you? do you remember me jasmine blighxc2xa0xc2xa0?"{34] the european broadcasting union was formed on 12 february 1950 in torquay with the bbc among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations{35]bbc television centre at white city west london which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013competition to the bbc was introduced in 1955 with the commercial and independently operated television network of itv however the bbc monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 october 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed independent broadcasting authority (iba) the uk's first independent local radio station lbc came on-air in the london area as a result of the pilkington committee report of 1962 in which the bbc was praised for the quality and range of its output and itv was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming{36] the decision was taken to award the bbc a second television channel bbc2 in 1964 renaming the existing service bbc1 bbc2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across europe bbc2 was broadcast in colour from 1 july 1967 and was joined by bbc1 and itv on 15 november 1969 the 405 line vhf transmissions of bbc1 (and itv) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985starting in 1964 a series of pirate radio stations (starting with radio caroline) came on the air and forced the british government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services in response the bbc reorganised and renamed their radio channels on 30 september 1967 the light programme was split into radio 1 offering continuous "popular" music and radio 2 more "easy listening"{37] the "third" programme became radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming the home service became radio 4 offering news and non-musical content such as quiz shows readings dramas and plays as well as the four national channels a series of local bbc radio stations were established in 1967 including radio london{38]in 1969 the bbc enterprises department was formed to exploit bbc brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products in 1979 it became a wholly owned limited company bbc enterprises ltd{39]in 1974 the bbc's teletext service ceefax was introduced created initially to provide subtitling but developed into a news and information service in 1978 bbc staff went on strike just before the christmas of that year thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one{40]{41]since the deregulation of the uk television and radio market in the 1980s the bbc has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster channel 4) especially on satellite television cable television and digital television services{citation needed]in the late 1980s the bbc began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation in 1988 it sold off the hulton press library a photographic archive which had been acquired from the picture post magazine by the bbc in 1957 the archive was sold to brian deutsch and is now owned by getty images{42] during the 1990s this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries of the bbc with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making bbc enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995 as bbc worldwide ltd{39] in 1998 bbc studios outside broadcasts post production design costumes and wigs were spun off into bbc resources ltd{43]the bbc research department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques in the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement{citation needed] the bbc was also responsible for the development of the nicam stereo standardin recent decades a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: radio 5 was launched in 1990 as a sports and educational station but was replaced in 1994 with radio 5 live following the success of the radio 4 service to cover the 1991 gulf war the new station would be a news and sport station in 1997 bbc news 24 a rolling news channel launched on digital television services and the following year bbc choice launched as the third general entertainment channel from the bbc the bbc also purchased the parliamentary channel which was renamed bbc parliament in 1999 bbc knowledge launched as a multi media channel with services available on the newly launched bbc text digital teletext service and on bbc online the channel had an educational aim which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries2000 to 2011{edit]in 2002 several television and radio channels were reorganised bbc knowledge was replaced by bbc four and became the bbc's arts and documentaries channel cbbc which had been a programming strand as children's bbc since 1985 was split into cbbc and cbeebies for younger children with both new services getting a digital channel: the cbbc channel and cbeebies channel in addition to the television channels new digital radio stations were created: 1xtra 6 music and bbc7 bbc 1xtra was a sister station to radio 1 and specialised in modern black music bbc 6 music specialised in alternative music genres and bbc7 specialised in archive speech and children's programmingthe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003 bbc choice was replaced by bbc three with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries bbc news 24 became the bbc news channel in 2008 and bbc radio 7 became bbc radio 4 extra in 2011 with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on radio 4 in 2008 another channel was launched bbc alba a scottish gaelic serviceduring this decade the corporation began to sell off a number of its operational divisions to private owners; bbc broadcast was spun off as a separate company in 2002{44] and in 2005 it was sold off to australian-based macquarie capital alliance group and macquarie bank limited and rebranded red bee media{45] the bbc's it telephony and broadcast technology were brought together as bbc technology ltd in 2001{44] and the division was later sold to the german engineering and electronics company siemens it solutions and services (sis){46] sis was subsequently acquired from siemens by the french company atos{47] further divestments in this decade included bbc books (sold to random house in 2006);{48] bbc outside broadcasts ltd (sold in 2008 to satellite information services);{49] costumes and wigs (stock sold in 2008 to angels the costumiers);{50] and bbc magazines (sold to immediate media company in 2011){51] after the sales of obs and costumes the remainder of bbc resources was reorganised as bbc studios and post production which continues today as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bbcthe 2004 hutton inquiry and the subsequent report raised questions about the bbc's journalistic standards and its impartiality this led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then director general greg dyke in january 2007 the bbc released minutes of the board meeting which led to greg dyke's resignation{52]unlike the other departments of the bbc the bbc world service was funded by the foreign and commonwealth office the foreign and commonwealth office more commonly known as the foreign office or the fco is the british government department responsible for promoting the interests of the united kingdom abroadbbc pacific quay in glasgow which was opened in 2007in 2006 bbc hd launched as an experimental service and became official in december 2007 the channel broadcast hd simulcasts of

schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in hd the bbc hd channel closed in march 2013 and was replaced by bbc2 hd in the same monthon 18 october 2007 bbc director general mark thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the bbc as an organisation the plans included a reduction in posts of 2500; including 1800 redundancies consolidating news operations reducing programming output by 10 and selling off the flagship television centre building in london{53] these plans have been fiercely opposed by unions who have threatened a series of strikes; however the bbc have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programmingon 20 october 2010 the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016 the same announcement revealed that the bbc would take on the full cost of running the bbc world service and the bbc monitoring service from the foreign and commonwealth office and partially finance the welsh broadcaster

scripted (drama and comedy)bbc studioworks is also separate and officially owns and operates some of the bbc's studio facilities such as the bbc elstree centre leasing them out to productions from

to xc2xa36471xc2xa0billion for british sky broadcasting in 201314{73] and xc2xa31843xc2xa0billion for itv in the calendar year 2013{74]revenue{edit]see also: television licence and television licensing in the united kingdomthe principal means of funding the bbc is through the television licence costing xc2xa314550 per year per household since april 2010 such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the uk the channel islands and the isle of man no licence is required to own a television used for other means or for sound only radio sets (though a separate licence for these was also required for non-tv households until 1971) the cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law a discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets a 50 discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired{75] and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged 75 or over as a result of the uk government's recent spending review an agreement has been reached between the government and the corporation in which the current licence fee will remain frozen at the current level until the royal charter is renewed at the beginning of 2017{76]the revenue is collected privately{clarification needed] and is paid into the central government consolidated fund a process defined in the communications act 2003 the bbc pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name "tv licensing" tv licensing collection is currently carried out by capita an outside agency funds are then allocated by the department of culture media and sport (dcms) and the treasury and approved by parliament via legislation additional revenues are paid by the department for work and pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-oldsthe licence fee is classified as a tax{77] and its evasion is a criminal offence since 1991 collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been the responsibility of the bbc in its role as tv licensing authority{78] thus the bbc is a major prosecuting authority in england and wales and an investigating authority in the uk as a whole the bbc carries out surveillance (mostly using subcontractors) on properties (under the auspices of the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000) and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant{79] according to the bbc "more than 204000 people in the uk were caught watching tv without a licence during the first six months of 2012"{80] licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates' courts{81]income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years{82] with bbc worldwide contributing some xc2xa3145xc2xa0million to the bbc's core public service businessaccording to the bbc's 201314 annual report its total income was xc2xa35 billion (xc2xa35066 billion){2] which can be broken down as follows:xc2xa33726 billion in licence fees collected from householders;xc2xa31023 billion from the bbc's commercial businesses;xc2xa32446xc2xa0million from government grants of which xc2xa32385xc2xa0million is from the foreign and commonwealth office for the bbc world service;xc2xa3721xc2xa0million from other income such as rental collections and royalties from overseas broadcasts of programming{2]the licence fee has however attracted criticism it has been argued that in an age of multi stream multi-channel availability an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate the bbc's use of private sector company capita group to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments or do not require a tv

channel islands and the isle of man (although these crown dependencies are outside the uk) and in the former there are two local stations xe2x80x93 bbc guernsey and bbc radio jersey there is no bbc local radio station however in the isle of man partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station manx radio which predates the existence of bbc local radio bbc services in the dependencies are financed from television licence fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the uk although collected locally this is the subject of some controversy in the isle of man since as well as having no bbc local radio service the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by bbc channel islands{111]bbc world service

and now oldest legal independent radio station in the country however the bbc did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several continental stations such as radio luxembourg had broadcast programmes in english to britain since the 1930s and the isle of man-based manx radio began in 1964 today despite the advent of commercial radio bbc radio stations remain among the most listened to in the country with radio 2 having the largest audience share (up to 168 in 2011xe2x80x9312) and radios 1 and 4 ranked second and third in terms of weekly reach{117]bbc programming is also available to

launched the service on bbc mobile making it accessible to mobile phones and pdas as well as developing alerts by e-mail digital television and on computers through a desktop alertratings figures suggest that during major incidents such as the 7 july 2005 london bombings or royal events the uk audience overwhelmingly turns to the bbc's coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals{120] on 7 july 2005 the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on london's public transport system the bbc online website recorded an all time bandwidth peak of 11xc2xa0gbs at 1200 on 7 july

other micro-sites such as bbc news online sport weather tv and radio as part of the site every programme on bbc television or radio is given its own page with bigger programmes getting their own

narrowband connections providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school initial content was made available in january 2006; however bbc jam was suspended on 20 march 2007 due to allegations made to the european commission that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry{129]in recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that bbc online receives too much funding from the television licence meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc online{130] some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc online should be reducedxe2x80x94either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site{131] in response to this the bbc carried out an investigation and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services bbc online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision (for example instead of providing local events information and timetables users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information) part of this plan included the bbc closing some of its websites and rediverting money to redevelop other parts{132]{133]on 26 february 2010 the times claimed that mark thompson director general of the bbc proposed that the bbc's web output should be cut by 50 with online staff numbers and budgets reduced by 25 in a bid to scale back bbc operations and allow commercial rivals more room{134] on 2 march 2010 the bbc reported that it will cut its website

significance{edit]until the development popularisation and domination of television radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the united kingdom relied it "reached into every home in the land and simultaneously united the nation an important factor during the second world war"{141] the bbc introduced the world's first "high-definition" 405-line television service in 1936 it suspended its television service during the second world war and until 1946 but remained the only television broadcaster in the uk until 1955 when independent television (itv) began operating{142] this heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium nevertheless "throughout the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy"{142] further the bbc was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 (when ury obtained their first licence){143]despite the advent of commercial television and radio the bbc has remained one of the main elements in british popular culture through its obligation to produce tv and radio programmes for mass audiences{144]{145] however the arrival of bbc2 allowed the bbc also to make programmes for minority interests in drama documentaries current affairs entertainment and sport examples cited include the television series civilisation doctor who i claudius monty python's flying circus pot black and tonight but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the bbc's entries in the british film institute's 2000 list of the 100 greatest british television programmes{146] the export of bbc programmes both through services like the bbc world service and bbc world news as well as through the channels operated by bbc worldwide means that audiences can consume bbc productions worldwidethe term "bbc english" was used as an alternative name for received pronunciation and the english pronouncing dictionary uses the term "bbc pronunciation" to label its recommendations{147] however the bbc itself now makes more use of regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the uk while continuing to expect clarity and fluency of its presenters{148] from its "starchy" beginnings the bbc has also become more inclusive and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities because they all pay the licence fee{149]competition from independent television channel 4 sky and other broadcast-television stations has lessened the bbc's influence but its public broadcasting remains a major influence on british popular culture{144]attitudes toward the bbc in popular culture{edit]older domestic uk audiences often refer to the bbc as "the beeb" a nickname originally coined by peter sellers on the goon show in the 1950s when he referred to the "beeb beeb ceeb" it was then borrowed shortened and popularised by kenny everett{150] another nickname now less commonly used is "auntie" said to originate from the old-fashioned "auntie knows best" attitude or the idea of aunties and uncles who are present in the background of one's life (but possibly a reference to the "aunties" and "uncles" who presented children's programmes in the early days){151] in the days when john reith the bbc's first director general was in charge the two nicknames have also been used together as "auntie beeb"{152]criticism and controversies{edit]main articles: criticism of the bbc and bbc controversiesthe bbc has faced various accusations regarding many topics: the iraq war politics ethics and religion as well as funding and staffing it also has been involved in numerous controversies because of its different sometimes controversial coverage of specific news stories and programming in october 2014 the bbc trust issued the "bbc complaints framework"{153] outlining complaints and appeals procedures however the regulatory oversight of the bbc may be transferred to ofcom the british "house of commons select committee on culture media and sport" recommended in its report "the future of the bbc"{154] that ofcom should become the final arbiter of complaints made about the bbc{155]accusations of a bias against the government and the conservative party were often made against the corporation by members of margaret thatcher's 1980s conservative government bbc has long faced accusations of liberal and leftwing bias{156] presenter andrew marr has said that "the bbc is not impartial or neutral it has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias" while former bbc director roger mosey classified it as "liberal defensive"{157]{158]{159] conversely the bbc has been criticised by the guardian columnist owen jones who has said that "the truth is the bbc is stacked full of rightwingers"{160] paul mason the former economics editor of the bbc's newsnight programme has also criticised the bbc as "unionist" in relation to the bbc's coverage of the 2014 scottish referendum campaign and "neo-liberal"{161] however peter sissons a main news presenter at the bbc from 1989xe2x80x942009 who from 1964xe2x80x941989 worked as a journalist and then senior presenter at itn latterly at channel 4 news says "at the core of the bbc in its very dna is a way of thinking that is firmly of the left"{162] the bbc has also been characterised as a pro-monarchist institution{163] the bbc was also accused of propaganda by journalist and author toby young due to what he believed to be an anti-brexit approach including a whole day of live programming on migration{164]the bbc world service was involved in the kyrgyz revolution in april 2010 one of the news presenters and a producer of the bbc world service language was revealed to have participated in the opposition movement at the time with the goal to overthrow the kyrgyzstan government led by president kurmanbek bakiyev using bbc resources the bbc producer resigned from his post in 2010 once the news of his participation in the revolution became public the bbc world service neither confirmed nor denied this story nor did the service issue a statement about this story{165]awards and nominations{edit]this
