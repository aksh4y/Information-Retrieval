hurricane on record and the deadliest recorded hurricane in the satellite era the storm was the thirteenth tropical storm ninth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 1998 hurricane season along with hurricane georges mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season at the time hurricane mitch was the strongest atlantic hurricane observed in the month of october though it has since been surpassed by hurricane wilma of the 2005 season the hurricane matched the fourth most intense atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh)mitch formed in the western caribbean sea on october 22 1998 and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions it rapidly strengthened to peak at categoryxc2xa05 status the highest possible rating on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale after drifting southwestward and weakening the hurricane hit honduras as a minimal hurricane it drifted through central america reformed in the bay of campeche and ultimately struck florida as a strong tropical stormdue to its slow motion from october 29 to november 3 hurricane mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in honduras guatemala and nicaragua with unofficial reports of up to 75 inches (1900xc2xa0mm) deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest atlantic hurricane in history after the great hurricane of 1780; nearly 11000xc2xa0people were killed with over 11000 left missing by the end of 1998 additionally roughly 27 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane the flooding caused extreme damage estimated at over 6xc2xa0billion (1998

depression thirteen formed on octoberxc2xa022 over the southwestern caribbean sea from a tropical wave that exited africa on octoberxc2xa010 it executed a small loop and while doing so intensified into tropical storm mitch a weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north after becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low mitch quickly intensified in response to favorable conditions{1] including warm waters and good outflow{2]{3] it became a hurricane on octoberxc2xa024 and developed an eye{4] after turning to the west mitch rapidly intensified first into a major hurricane on octoberxc2xa025 and then into a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the next day{1]at peak intensity mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of 180xc2xa0mph (285xc2xa0kmh) while off the northern coast of honduras hurricane hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of 905xc2xa0mbar (267xc2xa0inhg) which at the time was the lowest in the month of october and tied for the fourth lowest for any atlantic hurricane initially the national hurricane center (nhc) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north threatening the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula instead mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active{1] land interaction imparted weakening{5] and the hurricane made landfall on honduras on octoberxc2xa029 with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh){1] mitch slowly weakened while turning to the west over land maintaining deep convection over waters{6] after moving across mountainous terrain in central america the surface circulation of mitch dissipated on novemberxc2xa01 the next day the remnants reached the gulf of mexico which reorganized into a tropical storm on novemberxc2xa03 mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front moving across the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula before striking near naples florida on novemberxc2xa05 shortly thereafter the storm became an extratropical cyclone which was tracked by the nhc until novemberxc2xa09{1]preparations{edit]due to the threat the government of honduras evacuated some of the 45000 citizens on the bay islands and prepared all air and naval resources the government of belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland{7] because the hurricane threatened to strike near belize city as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of hurricane hattie 37xc2xa0years earlier{8] guatemala issued a purple alert as well recommending boats to stay in port telling people to prepare or seek shelter and warning of potential overflowing rivers{7] by the time hurricane mitch made landfall numerous people were evacuated along the western caribbean coastline including 100000 in honduras 10000 in guatemala and 20000 in the mexican state of quintana roo{9]impact{edit]impact by

mitch was the deadliest atlantic hurricane since the great hurricane of 1780 displacing the galveston hurricane of 1900 as the second-deadliest on record nearly 11000 people were confirmed dead and almost as many reported missing deaths were mostly from flooding and mudslides in central america where the slow-moving hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly 36 inches (900xc2xa0mm) of rain the flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes with total damage amounting to over 5xc2xa0billion (1998xc2xa0usd 6xc2xa0billion 2006xc2xa0usd) most of which was in honduras and nicaragua prior to mitch the deadliest hurricane in central america was hurricane fifi in 1974 which killed an estimated 8000xe2x80x9310000{1]honduras{edit]main article: effects of hurricane mitch in honduraswhile offshore northern honduras hurricane mitch passed over guanaja island{1] high waves eroded northern coastlines and damaged lagoons{16] most of the bay islands had damage to their water facilities{17] two days of winds exceeding 200xc2xa0kmh (120xc2xa0mph) destroyed nearly all of the plants and trees on guanaja uprooting or knocking down almost the entire mangrove forest{18] it is estimated that the hurricane produced waves of 44xc2xa0ft (13xc2xa0m) in height{19]damage in tegucigalpawhile moving slowly for several days offshore honduras hurricane mitch drew moisture from the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea producing high amounts of rainfall of over 300xc2xa0mm (12xc2xa0in) per day{8] the highest official total was 928xc2xa0mm (365xc2xa0in) at choluteca which represented more than half of the annual precipitation average; at the same location 4667xc2xa0mm (1837xc2xa0in) fell in a 24-hour period on octoberxc2xa031 which was more than double of the previous record set in 1985{20] there were unofficial rainfall totals in central america as high as 1900xc2xa0mm (75xc2xa0in); rain gauges in mountainous areas were washed away{8] the high rainfall caused many rivers in the country to overflow "to an unprecedented extent this century" as described by the united nations{20] the rainfall collected in rivers causing extensive river flooding across the country the greatest depth recorded was 125xc2xa0m (41xc2xa0ft) on the ulxc3xbaa river near chinda whilst the greatest width recorded was 359xc2xa0m (1178xc2xa0ft) on the rxc3xado lean near arizona the rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country{21] in the country's interior particularly the southern portion the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides many of them shallow and about 95 in the form of debris flow however two earthflows caused significant damage near tegucigalpa{22]mudslide in san juancito hondurashurricane mitch wrought significant damage to honduras affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments{20] the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean estimated that mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country{16] an estimated 70xe2x80x9380 of transportation network was destroyed including most bridges and secondary roads{8] amounting to 236xc2xa0million in damage hurricane mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than 385xc2xa0km (239xc2xa0mi) of power lines and several power plants{16] about 70 of honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages{20] the combined damage to transportation communication utilities including power and water was estimated at 665xc2xa0million{17]high water levels along the choluteca river affected the capital tegucigalpa{17] reaching levels 10xc2xa0m (33xc2xa0ft) above their banks{20] the floods damaged about one-third of buildings including some more than 350xc2xa0years old{8] across honduras agriculture sustained serious damage with initial estimates of 70 of crops destroyed{8] about 50000xc2xa0bovine were killed as were 60 of the fowl population{17] crop and agricultural damage totaled about 1xc2xa0billion{16] which would take the country years to recover{8] honduras's social fund for housing estimated that 35000xc2xa0houses nationwide were destroyed with another 50000xc2xa0damaged{17] leaving 15xc2xa0millionxc2xa0people homeless xe2x80x93 about 20 of the total population{8] this was the highest number of victims from any natural disaster in honduras's history{20] overall hurricane mitch killed about 7000xc2xa0people in honduras{20] and damage was estimated at l52345000000 (38xc2xa0billion){17] of which 2005xc2xa0billion was from direct damages and the remainder from indirect costs the overall impact represented about 70 of honduras's annual gross domestic product (gdp){16]nicaragua{edit]flooding in lake managua after the hurricanethough mitch never entered nicaragua its large circulation caused extensive rainfall with estimates of over 50 inches (1300xc2xa0mm){8] in some places as much as 25 inches (630xc2xa0mm) of rain fell on coastal areas{23] the flank of the casita volcano failed and turned into a lahar from excessive rain the resulting mudslide ultimately covered an area 10xc2xa0miles (16xc2xa0km) long and 5xc2xa0miles (8xc2xa0km) wide{8]two million people in nicaragua were directly affected by the hurricane{8] across the country mitch's heavy rains damaged 17600 houses and destroyed 23900 displacing 368300 of the population{24] 340 schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged and combined with property damage totaled to 300xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd){25]casita volcano in western nicaragua after deadly mudslidetransportation was greatly affected by the hurricane as well the rainfall left 70 of the roads unusable or destroyed and greatly damaged 92xc2xa0bridges{26] over 1700xc2xa0miles (2700xc2xa0km) of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm especially in the northern part of the country and along portions of the pan-american highway total transportation damage amounted to 300xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd) agricultural losses were significant including the deaths of 50000 animals mostly bovines crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well and combined with agricultural losses damage totaled to 185xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd){25]the situation was further compounded by a total of 75000 live land minesxe2x80x94left over from the contra insurgency of the 1980sxe2x80x94that were calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters{27]in all hurricane mitch caused at least 3800 fatalities in nicaragua of which more than 2000 were killed in the towns of el provenir and rolando rodriguez from the landslide at the casita volcano the mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud throughout the entire country the hurricane left between 500000 and 800000 homeless in all damage in nicaragua is estimated at around 1xc2xa0billion (1998xc2xa0usd){8]caribbean sea{edit]mitch was also responsible for the loss with all hands of windjammer barefoot cruises' schooner fantome the story was recorded in the book the ship and the storm by jim carrier the schooner which was sailing near the center of the hurricane experienced over 50xc2xa0foot (15xc2xa0m) waves and over 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) winds causing her to sink off the coast of honduras{28]on the south coast of cuba the hurricane caused waves of up to 13xc2xa0feet (4xc2xa0m) high and winds gusts peaking at 42xc2xa0mph (67xc2xa0kmh) causing numerous tourists and workers on the isle of youth and cayo largo del sur to leave for safer grounds{29]in jamaica where officials declared hurricane warnings 12xc2xa0hours prior to its closest approach{1] mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days strong waves hit western jamaica with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly 7xc2xa0feet (2xc2xa0m) in height the rainfall in outer rainbands at times severe flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris one house in spanish town collapsed from the flooding leaving four homeless many other homes and buildings were flooded forcing many to evacuate a river in northeastern jamaica overflowed its banks while heavy rainfall across the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides{30] in all mitch killed three people on jamaica{8]on the cayman islands the hurricane caused strong waves gusty winds and heavy rainfall at times damage was relatively minimal amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion strong waves damaged or destroyed many docks on the south shore of the islands and also sank one dive ship near grand cayman in addition numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled{31]rest of central america{edit]deadliest atlantic hurricanesrankhurricaneseasonfatalities1"great

dropped heavy precipitation as far south as panama especially in the darixc3xa9n and chiriquxc3xad provinces the flooding washed away a few roads and bridges and damaged numerous houses and schools leaving thousands homeless{32] the hurricane left three casualties in panama{8]in costa rica mitch dropped heavy rains causing flash flooding and mudslides across the country mostly in the northeastern part of the country{8] the storm impacted 2135 homes to some degree of which 241 were destroyed{11] leaving 4000 homeless{23] throughout the country the rainfall and mudslides affected 126 bridges and 800 miles (1300xc2xa0km) or roads mostly on the inter-american highway which was affected by hurricane cesar two years prior mitch affected 115 sq miles (300xc2xa0km2) of crop lands causing damage to both export and domestic crops in all hurricane mitch caused 92xc2xa0million in damage (1998xc2xa0usd){11] and seven deaths{8]while drifting through el salvador the hurricane dropped immense amounts of precipitation resulting in flash flooding and mudslides through the country multiple rivers including the rxc3xado grande de san miguel and the lempa river overflowed contributing to overall damage the flooding damaged more than 10000 houses leaving around 84000 homeless{12] and forcing 500000 to evacuate{33] crop damage was severe with serious flooding occurring on 386 sq miles (1000 km2) of pasture or crop land the flooding destroyed 37 of the bean production 19 of the corn production and 20 losses in sugar canes there were heavy losses in livestock as well including the deaths of 10000 cattle total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to 154 million (1998xc2xa0usd) in addition the flooding destroyed two bridges and damaged 1200xc2xa0mi (1900xc2xa0km) of unpaved roads in all mitch caused nearly 400 million in damage (1998 usd) and 240 deaths{12]similar to the rest of central america mitch's heavy rains caused mudslides and severe flooding over guatemala the flooding destroyed 6000 houses and damaged 20000 others displacing over 730000 and forcing over 100000 to evacuate in addition the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others 175 severely flooding caused major damage to crops while landslides destroyed crop land across the country the most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were tomatoes bananas corn other vegetables and beans with damaged totaling to 48 million (1998 usd) export crops such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well with damage amounting to 325 million (1998 usd) damage to plantations and soil totaled to 121 million (1998 usd) the flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure including the loss of 37 bridges across the country flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1350xc2xa0km) of roads of which nearly 400 miles (640xc2xa0km) were sections of major highways in all hurricane mitch caused 748 million (1998 usd) and 268 deaths in guatemala{13] in addition mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm{33]in belize the hurricane was less severe than initially predicted though mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country{33] numerous rivers exceeded their crests though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in mountainous areas{34] the flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads throughout the country eleven people died because of the hurricane{33]rainfall totals in mexico and floridain mexico mitch produced gusty winds and heavy rains on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula with cancxc3xban on the quintana roo coast being the worst hit{33] nine people were killed from the flooding though damage was relatively minimal{8] the maximum 24-hour rainfall total from mitch was 134 inches (340xc2xa0mm) in campeche{35] while the highest rainfall total was 1685 inches (4280xc2xa0mm) in ciudad del carmen{36]florida and remnants{edit]then a tropical storm mitch caused a storm surge of up to 4 feet (12xc2xa0m) in the lower florida keys before making landfall on the florida west coast key west international airport reported peak wind gusts of 55xc2xa0mph (89xc2xa0kmh) and sustained winds of 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) the only report of tropical storm force in the state{1] offshore the fowey rocks light reported a wind gusts of 73xc2xa0mph (117xc2xa0kmh){37] in addition mitch caused moderate rainfall peaking at 7 inches (200xc2xa0mm) in jupiter though some estimates indicate localized totals of up to 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) the storm spawned five tornadoes over the state the strongest of which was an f2{1]in the florida keys multiple buildings that had been damaged by hurricane georges were leveled by mitch{8] tornadoes from the storm damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state in addition to injuring 65xc2xa0people{1] gusty winds left 100000 without power during the storm's passage{8] in all mitch caused 40xc2xa0million in damage (1998xc2xa0usd) in florida and two deaths from drowning when two boats capsized{1]as an extratropical cyclone mitch passed west of ireland and the united kingdom in ireland the storm produced gusts as high as 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) and 30xc2xa0ft (91xc2xa0m) waves the winds knocked down trees and power lines leaving over 30000xc2xa0homes without power one tree fell onto a car in louth severely injuring the driver in dublin high winds knocked the roof off of a building and several other buildings nationwide were damaged the storm caused airports to close and ferry service to be suspended{38]aftermath{edit]cleanup in tegucigalpasee also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the hurricane's destruction in central america and elsewhere in north america the world meteorological organization retired the name mitch in the spring of 1999; it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was replaced with matthew in the 2004 season which was itself retired after the 2016 seasonafter the disaster caused by hurricane mitch countries around the world donated significant aid totaling 63xc2xa0billion (1998xc2xa0usd) throughout central america which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996 many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy in addition after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again{39]the run-off from mitch on november 1hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses with a new structurally improved foundation homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane however lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many decreasing an already low income even lower{40]following the passage of mitch disease outbreaks occurred throughout central america including cholera leptospirosis and dengue fever over 2328 cases of cholera were reported killing 34xc2xa0people guatemala was most affected by the bacterium where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in nicaragua killing seven people there were over 1357 cases of dengue reported though no deaths were reported from the disease{41]while stalling over the western caribbean sea mitch's strong winds produced strong waves damaging local coral reefs later the storm's immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water this resulted in diseases occurring within the coral however the hurricane's upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef{42]mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that honduran president carlos roberto flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country{8] honduras the country most affected by the hurricane received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane mexico quickly gave help sending 700xc2xa0tons of food 11xc2xa0tons of medicine four rescue planes rescue personnel and trained search dogs cuba also volunteered sending a contingent of physicians to the country{43] the us administration offered at first troops stationed in honduras and then withdrew them a few days after the storm they also at first offered only 2xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd) in aid which came as a shock to residents and president carlos roberto flores alike the us later increased their offer to 70xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd){44] the honduran government distributed food water and medical services to the hurricane victims including the more than 4xc2xa0million without water{39] in addition the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate largely due to the destruction of crop lands however rebuilding provided jobs in the following years{15] in costa rica reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 59 lowering the unemployment rate slightly{11]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portal1990s portallist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneslist of deadliest atlantic hurricaneslist of retired atlantic
