hurricane that struck extreme northeastern mexico near the texas-tamaulipas border in mid-august of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season erika was the eighth tropical cyclone fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season at first the national hurricane center (nhc) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70xc2xa0mph (115xc2xa0kmh) at erika's peak intensity it was not until later data was analyzed that the nhc revised it to categoryxc2xa01 intensity in the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the storm developed from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern gulf of mexico on august 14 under the influence of a high pressure system erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions it made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern mexico on august 16 and rapidly dissipated inlandwhile erika's precursor disturbance was moving across florida it dropped heavy rainfall in south texas erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60xc2xa0mph (80 to 95xc2xa0kmh) along with light rain causing minor and isolated wind damage in the state in northeastern mexico erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall resulting in mudslides and flooding there two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaterscontents1 meteorological history2

of low pressure detached from a frontal system on august 8 while 1150xc2xa0miles (1850xc2xa0km) to the east of bermuda it moved southwestward and on august 9 it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low the surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center and by august 11 the surface low developed into a trough while 440xc2xa0miles (700xc2xa0km) south of bermuda as the system rapidly continued westward much of the convection remained near the center of the upper-level low preventing development of a closed surface circulation on august 13 while located near the northwestern bahamas a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone{1]a closed low-level circulation nearly developed on august 14 to the east of key largo florida but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center the mid-level storm continued westward and moved across florida{1] after crossing florida hurricane hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength and the system was designated as tropical storm erika late on august 14 while located 85xc2xa0miles (135xc2xa0km) west of fort myers{2]nexrad image of erika making landfall on northeastern mexicowith well-established outflow and low levels of wind shear{2] erika strengthened as the circulation became better defined a high pressure system persisted over the south-central united states forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25xc2xa0mph (40xc2xa0kmh) on august 15 convection organized into bands and as its winds approached hurricane strength an eye developed within the storm erika turned to the west-southwest on august 16 and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near boca san rafael tamaulipas in northeastern mexico or about 40xc2xa0miles (70xc2xa0km) south of the united statesxe2x80x93mexico border the storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous sierra madre oriental and erika dissipated early on august 17{1] the mid-level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed mexico and led to the formation of a tropical disturbance after entering the gulf of california on august 18 it turned to the northwest and weakened on august 20{3]operationally erika was never upgraded to hurricane status based on a persistent eye feature on radar and doppler weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) the national hurricane center posthumously upgraded erika to a hurricane{1]preparations{edit]tropical storm erika approaching mexico on august 15the threat of erika's onslaught prompted the evacuation of 51xc2xa0oil platforms and 3xc2xa0oil rigs in the western gulf of mexico the lack of production led to a loss of production of 8708 barrels (13845xc2xa0m3) of oil per day and 17314xc2xa0million cubic feet (4903000xc2xa0m3) of natural gas per day on the day of its landfall the lack of production led to 1979 less barrels of oil for the day or about 012 of the total daily production for the gulf of mexico while the loss of 32xc2xa0million cubic feet (910000xc2xa0m3) of gas for the day was equivalent to 023 of the total production{4] however due to its rapid motion the passage of the storm resulted in minimal effects on operations{5]while the storm was located in the eastern gulf of mexico on august 15 the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from brownsville to baffin bay texas the center also recommended a hurricane watch spanning from soto la marina tamaulipas to the international border late that same day when strengthening was underway a hurricane warning was either issued or recommended from la pesca mexico to baffin bay texas though the warnings for south texas were dropped when a more southward motion occurred{1] just one month after hurricane claudette caused millions in damage in south texas the fast movement of erika caught citizens by surprise as it was forecast to make landfall near brownsville citizens and business owners boarded up for the storm{6] about 10000 were evacuated from northeastern mexico due to the threat for flooding{7] including 2000 in matamoros{5]impact{edit]rainfall data for erikathe precursor disturbance was expected to bring heavy yet needed rainfall to the bahamas{8] the precursor disturbance dropped heavy precipitation while moving across florida including in indian river county{9] and also produced 6xe2x80x938xc2xa0ft (18xe2x80x9324xc2xa0m) waves with moderate wind gusts{10]erika produced light rainfall across southern texas peaking at 383xc2xa0inches (97xc2xa0mm) in sabinal{11] though most locations reported less than two inches (50xc2xa0mm) of precipitation in addition weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6xc2xa0inches (100 to 150xc2xa0mm) of precipitation in kenedy and brooks counties sustained winds from erika in south texas peaked at 39xc2xa0mph (62xc2xa0kmh) in brownsville where a gust of 47xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) was also recorded{1] strong waves were reported northwards to corpus christi{12] the storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along south padre island{1] strong wind gusts of up to 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) caused isolated minor wind damage in south texas including in south padre island where the winds damaged the roof of a business the winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in brownsville in texas damage totaled to 10000 (2003xc2xa0usd 13xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd){13]in mexico hurricane erika primarily affected the states of tamaulipas and nuevo lexc3xb3n but also had effects on coahuila as well rainfall peaked at 671xc2xa0inches (1705xc2xa0mm) in magueyes in tamaulipas{14] several other locations reported over 3xc2xa0inches (76xc2xa0mm){1] including 402xc2xa0inches (102xc2xa0mm) in cerro prieto which was the maximum amount in the state of nuevo lexc3xb3n{14] and 342xc2xa0inches (868xc2xa0mm) in monterrey{1] where 30xc2xa0people were injured{7] sustained winds peaked at 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh) in san fernando where a gust of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) was also reported{1] the heavy rainfall resulted in severe flooding and mudslides blocking several highways in northeastern mexico{14] in matamoros the storm damaged roofs and cars{7] moderate winds snapped tree branches and spread debris across roads though locals considered the storm minor{5] in the nuevo lexc3xb3n city of montemorelos two people died when they were swept away after they drove their truck across a partially flooded bridge{1] throughout mexico 20000xc2xa0people were left without power due to the storm{7] the remnant circulation produced heavy amounts of precipitation in western mexico and baja california{3]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalhurricane barryreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k franklin (2003) "hurricane erika tropical cyclone report" (pdf)
