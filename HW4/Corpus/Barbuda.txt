it damaged or destroyed 95 of the island's buildings and infrastructure leaving barbuda "barely habitable" according to prime minister gaston browne everyone on the island was evacuated to antigua leaving barbuda uninhabited for the first time in modern history{5]contents1 history11 slavery12 natural disasters121 hurricane irma2 tourism3 geography4 wildlife5 climate6 education7 see also8 references9 external linkshistory{edit]main article: history of antigua and barbudathe ciboney (guanahuatebey) peoples lived on the island of barbuda during the stone age{6]{7] arawak and carib indians populated the island when christopher columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493 early settlements by the spanish and french were succeeded by the english who formed a colony in 1666in 1685 barbuda was leased to brothers christopher and john codrington who had founded the town of codrington the codrington family also produced food on the land and they transported slaves as labour for their sugarcane plantations on antigua during the 1740s there were multiple rebellions of slaves at codrington during which enslaved people revolted against the people who were enslaving them all slaves were freed in 1834on 1 november 1981 the island gained its independence as an integral part of antigua and barbuda a member of the commonwealth of nations in a 1989 election the barbuda independence movement received too few votes to qualify for a seat in the national parliamentslavery{edit]there is a widespread belief shared by some barbudans that the codringtons set up a human stock farm on barbuda for the purpose of breeding the strongest tallest enslaved people{8]{9] an article in the annals of the new york academy of science has disputed this stating that the codringtons considered using barbuda as a nursery where slave children would have been raised to later work on antiguan plantations but this plan was also never realized{10]other sources indicate that slaves were in fact an export commodity{11] but this was probably due to natural population growth no new slaves had arrived on the island since the mid 1700s{12] in any event the island was certainly an exporter of slaves an estimate in 1977 by lowenthal and clark indicated that during 1779 to 1834 the number of slaves exported totalled 172; most were taken to antigua but 37 went to the leeward and windward islands and some to the southern us several slave rebellions took place on the island with the most serious in 1834xe2x80x935{13] britain emancipated slaves in most of its colonies in 1834 but that did not include barbuda so the island then freed its own slaves for some years thereafter the freed slaves had little opportunity of survival on their own because of limited agricultural land and the lack of available credit to buy some hence they continued to work on the plantations for nominal wages or lived in shantytowns and worked as occasional labourers{14] sugar cane production remained the primary economy for over a century effective trade unions were not formed until the 1930s{12]the first map of barbuda was made in the second half of the 18th century at that time there were substantial buildings in the highland area a castle in codrington a fort at river now known as the martello tower and houses at palmetto point coco point and castle hill the map shows eight catching pens for holding captured runaway slaves indicating that this was a serious problem there were several defensive cannon gun battery units around the island perimeter there was a large plantation in the meadow and guava area and another large plantation in the highlands area{13]natural disasters{edit]satellite images of antigua and barbuda from august 21 2017 and september 8 2017 illustrating the damage caused by hurricane irma to barbuda the browning of the island was a result of extreme wind damage to foliage and desiccation of vegetation due to sea spray{15]as one of the most devastating hurricanes to strike the northern leeward islands in the 20th century hurricane luis caused significant destruction to barbuda as a category 4 storm in september 1995 a large number of houses were damaged or destroyed with three deaths and over 100 injuries and power and water system disruptions the hurricane left over 3000 homeless; many lived in shelters for months the estimates to rebuild ranged from 100 million to 350 million{16] not all damaged buildings were replaced in early 2013 only two very expensive hotels were operating in addition to a few cottages that were for rent in fact there were very few facilities for tourists{17] a report in early 2017 confirmed that there were still only two hotels; the primary attractions were the pristine beaches{18] many of the accommodations listed on the tripadvisor page for barbuda were actually in antigua{19]hurricane irma{edit]a house that was badly damaged by the hurricanehurricane irma caused catastrophic damage when it made landfall on the island on 6xc2xa0september 2017 prime minister gaston browne stated that the category 5 hurricane had destroyed 95 of the structures and vehicles{20] initial estimates showed that at least 60 of the island's residents were homeless because of the disaster{21] all communications with barbuda were down for a time; the storm had destroyed most of the communications system{22]on 8 september 2017 the government began to evacuate the entire island (with residents moved to antigua) in preparation of the category 4 hurricane jose which was approaching from the east{23] nearly 1800 residents were evacuated to antigua;{24] some were accommodated in the sir vivian richards cricket stadium{25] a hurricane warning for jose was issued for several islands including barbuda{26]{24] on 14 september ronald sanders ambassador to the us described the situation on barbuda "there is no electricity there there is no potable water anymore there is no structure in which people can survive we have a mammoth task on our hands"{5] he also stated this is the first time in 300 years that the island has not had a single living person on it{27]{inconsistent]ronald sanders said "we are a small island community xe2x80x94 the gross domestic product of antigua is 1 billion a year we cannot afford to take on this responsibility by ourselves barbuda is not just a disaster it's a humanitarian crisis we are hopeful that the international community will come to our aid not because wexe2x80x99re begging for something we want but because wexe2x80x99re begging for something that is needed"{5]the united states agency for international development confirmed its commitment to provide coordination between the government and aid organizations; it also sent a disaster assistance response team{28] on 8 september the first of three cargo planes arrived in antigua from the us with over 120000 pounds of relief for barbudans the cost was covered by the government of antigua and barbuda and with donations from martin franklyn and the coleman company in the us{29]an estimate published by time indicated that over 100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure in a statement antigua and barbuda's ambassador to the united states ronald sanders stated that the reconstruction may cost up to 300 million philmore mullin director of barbuda's national office of disaster services said that "all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent xe2x80x93 food supply medicine shelter electricity water communications waste management public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety it is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months  in my 25 years in disaster management i have never seen something like this"{25]tourism{edit]barbuda's climate pristine beaches and geography attracted tourism for many years barbuda was served by barbuda codrington airport and also had a ferry service to antigua activities included swimming snorkeling fishing and caving years after hurricane luis in august 2017 there were still only two operating resorts on the island although plans were being made to build other resorts before hurricane irma{30]attractions that were popular included the frigate bird sanctuary in the codrington lagoon martello tower a 19th-century fort and the indian cave with its two rock-carved petroglyphs other points of interest included the beautiful pink sands beach darby's cave a sinkhole with a tropical rain forest inside and highland house (called willybob locally) the ruins of the 18th-century codrington family home and the dividing wall that separated the wealthy family from its slaves{31]{30]{32]geography{edit]the total land area is 16056 square kilometres (62xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) the capital and largest town is codrington with an estimated population of 1638 (2011 population census) more people of barbudan descent live on antigua than on the island itself the island is mostly coral limestone with little topographical variation the "highlands" area on the eastern side of the island has hills rising to 125xc2xa0ft (38xc2xa0m) but the majority of the island is very flat with many lagoons in the northwest cornerwildlife{edit]this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it (september 2017)the antiguan racer is among the rarest snakes in the world the lesser antilles are home to four species of racers all four have undergone severe range reductions;
