for a television series by television executive paul stupin williamson's script was initially turned down by fox but the wb picked it up for its new tuesday night lineupwilliamson said "i pitched it as some kind of wonderful meets pump up the volume meets james at 15 meets my so-called life meets little house on the prairie"{4] the show's lead character dawson leery was based on williamson himself: obsessed with movies and platonically sharing his bed with the girl down the creekthe entire first season thirteen episodes was filmed before the first episode even aired{5]after the end of the second season williamson left to focus on wasteland a new show for abc{6] but returned to write the two-hour series finale{7]joey potter (katie holmes) and dawson leery (james van der beek) in the "pilot" episode (c 1998)procter  gamble productions (the company behind such daytime dramas as guiding light and as the world turns) was an original co-producer of the series the company however sold its interest in the show three months before the premiere when printed stories surfaced about the racy dialogue and risquxc3xa9 plot lines{8]filming locations{edit]dawson's creek was filmed in wilmington north carolina at euescreen gems studios and on location around wilmington southport and wrightsville beach north carolina college scenes in the fifth and sixth seasons were shot at duke university durham north carolina and additional shooting was done in raleigh north carolina in 1999 some scenes were shot on the university of richmond campus the fourth-season episode "eastern standard time" also did location shooting in new york city including at grand central terminal the ice house restaurant owned by the potter family and featured in the show is actually dockside restaurant in wilmington nc (the location at the end of the show when ice house was owned by pacey actually switched to elijah's also in wilmington nc)the wilmington area benefited greatly from the show while a number of films commercials and music videos had been shot at the studios the show was the first to occupy numerous soundstages for many years one tree hill later occupied some of those same soundstages for several years and used some of the same locations in wilmington{9]in addition to business brought into the community by the project it attracted attention to the city as a filming location and boosted tourism{10] the visitors' bureau distributed a special guide to filming locations used in the show{9] when the program was cancelled in 2003 the news was reported on the front-page of wilmington's daily newspaper the wilmington starnewsdawson's creek and home (6424 head road){edit]sunset shots of dawson standing on his dock among the marsh grass were filmed along hewlett's creek on pine grove drive between masonboro loop road and holly tree drive in masonboro north carolina{9]{11] the private residences used as homes for dawson jen and joey are all located along the shores of hewlett's creeksome of the scenes shown during the opening credits and miscellaneous scenery shots throughout the episodes were filmed in martha's vineyard an island off the coast of massachusetts one of which is a pan of oak bluffs harbor and another includes a shot of circuit avenue also in oak bluffs macapeside{edit]capeside is a fictional town in massachusetts where dawson's creek takes place it is located on cape cod possibly somewhere mid-cape between falmouth and yarmouth as an early episode includes these real towns in a "hurricane day" announcement incorporated in 1815 the town has a population of 35000 and is located between the cities of providence rhode island and boston massachusetts capeside exteriors were shot in and around wilmington north carolina its bays and coastlines are similar to those found along the coast of massachusettscapeside high school is the high school in capeside massachusetts attended by several characters during the first four seasons of the show exteriors were filmed at the university of north carolina at wilmingtona dawson creek actually exists in the canadian province of british columbia it is named for the river of the same name that runs through it another exists in oriental nc which flows into the neuse river this served as the inspiration for the show's name there is also a dawson's creek that runs through baton rouge louisianarestaurants and bars in the show{edit]interiors for the icehouse were filmed at the icehouse bar in downtown wilmington several blocks from less picturesque water so exteriors were filmed at the dockside restaurant at 1308 airlie road in wrightsville beach nc nearby constructions at the real icehouse forced producers to eliminate the bar from the storyline by burning it down{9]the hell's kitchen bar featured in the show was a natural food store at 118 princess street in wilmington which was purchased by producers dressed as a seedy college bar and used for production during the show's last season when production completed the building was purchased by a local restaurateur along with much of the set and decorations and converted it into a real restaurant and bar it retains the name as well{9]leery's fresh fish exteriors were filmed at water street restaurant at 5 south water street in wilmington{9]worthington university{edit]worthington university is a fictional university from dawson's creek joey (played by katie holmes) and audrey (played by busy philipps) characters from the series attended this school it is supposed to be located in boston massachusetts and to have been founded in 1787 by josiah worthington it is sometimes said to be an "ivy league college"producers had not planned for the show to extend beyond the characters' high school years the architectural uniformity of unc wilmington prevented it from being used for worthington university exteriors the scenes at worthington were filmed over two hours away at duke university{12] and a number of its students served as extras{12] some filming was also done on franklin street adjacent to nearby university of north carolina at chapel hillreception{edit]critical reception{edit]dawson's creek generated a high amount of publicity before its debut with several television critics and consumer watchdog groups expressing concerns about its anticipated "racy" plots and dialogue the controversy drove one of the original production companies away from the project{8]{13]john kiesewetter television columnist for the cincinnati enquirer wrote "as much as i want to love the showxe2x80x94the cool kids charming new england setting and stunning cinematographyxe2x80x94i can't get past the consuming preoccupation with sex sex sex"{13] in his defense williamson denied this was his intention stating that "i never set out to make something provocative and racy"{13]syndicated columnist john leo said the show should be called "when parents cringe" and went on to write "the first episode contains a good deal of chatter about breasts genitalia masturbation and penis size then the title and credits come on and the story begins" tom shales of the washington post commented that creator kevin williamson was "the most overrated wunderkind in hollywood" and "what he's brilliant at is pandering"the parents television council proclaimed the show as the single worst program of the 1997xe2x80x9398 and 1998-99 seasons by being "the crudest of the network shows aimed at kids" complaining about "an almost obsessive focus on pre-marital sexual activity" references to pornography and condoms and the show's acceptance of homosexuality{14] the council also cited it as the fourth worst show in 2000xe2x80x932001{15] former upn president lucie salhany criticized wb for airing dawson's creek which features "adolescent characters in adult situations" in an early timeslot while the network is supposed to be "the family network"{16] however on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum the national organization for women offered an endorsement deeming it one of the least sexually exploitative shows on the airdespite the controversy surrounding the sexual-oriented topics the show was a major critical success before its premiere san francisco chronicle explained the buzz around the show was due to its creator kevin williamson who wrote the screenplays for scream and scream 2 and that the show might be "one of the year's tangier hits" he also found dawson's creek scenically "downright luxuriant" and liked that it "doesn't have the rushed feel of so many teen shows the edginess is in the situations not the pacing"{17] variety wrote that it was "an addictive drama with considerable heartthe teenage equivalent of a woody allen moviexe2x80x94a kind of 'deconstructing puberty'"{18] the atlanta journal-constitution called it "a teen's dream" the dayton daily news listed capeside as a television town they'd most like to live in the seattle times declared it the best show of the 1997xe2x80x931998 season and said it "belongs to the small-pantheon my so-called life james at 15 and to a lesser extent party of five and doogie howser md{19]awards and accolades{edit]dawson's creek was nominated for fourteen awards including alma awards casting society of america awards golden satellite awards tv guide awards and youngstar

tv-14 for contentwhile never a huge ratings success among the general television population dawson's creek did very well with the younger demographic it targeted and became a defining show for the wb network the pilot episode was watched by 68 million viewers and had a 48 rating which was the network's highest rating at the time{25] the first season's highest ranked episode was the finale which was fifty-ninth while the second highest rated was the second episode (probably scoring so well partially because the other major networks carried president clinton's state of the union address in the midst of the lewinsky scandal rather than their regular programming){26] the finale itself was watched by 78 million us viewers which was its largest audience ever{citation needed]spin-off{edit]the show had in the words of television experts tim brooks and earle marsh a "semi-spinoff" xe2x80x93 young americans the protagonist of young americans will krudski (rodney scott) was introduced in three episodes at the end of the show's third season as a former classmate of dawson joey and pacey who had moved away some years before and had returned for a visit he was never referred to before or seen again young americans was made by the same company as dawson's creek columbia tristar television and appeared in dawson's creek's timeslot when it went on hiatus during the summer of 2000 the show had 8 episodes the reason the show is considered a semi-spinoff instead of a true spinoff is that will was not originally created for dawson's creek he was added to dawson's solely to set up and promote the series young americans{27]simon  schuster published a series of fifteen mass-market paperback novelizations of the series{9]{28]the amanda show featured a skit entitled "moody's point" to parody
