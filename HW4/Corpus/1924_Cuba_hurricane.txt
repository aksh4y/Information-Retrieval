this is the equivalence of a major hurricane or a categoryxc2xa03 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale the estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations{1]beginning late on octoberxc2xa018 as it tracked north-northeastward toward cuba the hurricane underwent rapid deepening evidenced by a ship wind report of 120xc2xa0mph (193xc2xa0kmh) this wind report was initially thought to be the peak intensity of the cyclone; however subsequent research confirmed further deepening based on very low pressures recorded across the region a ship in the radius of maximum winds reported a reading of 922xc2xa0mbar; the barometer on the ship was found to be 5xc2xa0mbar too high resulting in a pressure of 917xc2xa0mbar{1] additionally a station on land reported a pressure of 932xc2xa0mbar (2752xc2xa0inhg){2] based on the readings the hurricane research division estimated the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 910xc2xa0mbar very near the western coast of cuba; this suggested peak winds of 165xc2xa0mph (270xc2xa0kmh) late on octoberxc2xa019 the hurricane made landfall in extreme western cuba in pinar del rxc3xado province{1] josxc3xa9 carlos millxc3xa1s director of the national observatory at havana believed that "this hurricane {was] one of the most severe ever experienced in our latitudes"{2]after exiting cuba into the gulf of mexico the hurricane weakened greatly on octoberxc2xa020 it passed a short distance west of key west florida and very early on octoberxc2xa021 the hurricane moved over marco island with winds of 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) the cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over miami it accelerated east-northeastward moving over the abaco islands in the bahamas gradually weakening the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on octoberxc2xa023 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front{1]impact and records{edit]as a developing tropical cyclone the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the swan islands off the coast of honduras{1] heavy rainfall occurred throughout jamaica causing street flooding and several mudslides but little damage no disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel{3] the storm brushed eastern belize while located off the coast producing 362xc2xa0inches (219xc2xa0mm) of rainfall and light winds{4]in extreme western cuba damage was very severe from the strong winds likened to the impact of a tornado severe damage was reported in los arroyos and arroyos de mantua in the latter location around a dozen people were killed 50 were injured and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop{2] across western pinar del rxc3xado province the hurricane destroyed all communication links{5] further from the center the capital city of havana recorded southerly winds of 72xc2xa0mph (116xc2xa0kmh) as well as a minimum pressure of about 999xc2xa0mbar (2950xc2xa0inhg){2] around the country the hurricane capsized several ships primarily fishing vessels the death toll in the country was estimated at around 90{5] in the days after the storm cuban president zayas authorized about 30000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in pinar del rxc3xado{6]several days prior to striking florida the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state storm warnings were issued along the east and west coastlines northward to cedar key and titusville{7] later hurricane warnings were issued for much of the same area{8] and schools in the tampa area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore{9] the hurricane first affected florida when it passed west of key west where sustained winds of 66xc2xa0mph (107xc2xa0kmh) along with gusts to 74xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) were reported little damage occurred in the region limited to downed trees; this was due to advance warning by the us weather bureau which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property{2] later the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern florida{2] damage was reported in fort myers and punta gorda and communications were temporarily cut although no deaths were reported{10] heavy rainfall was reported along its path and one location accumulated 2322xc2xa0inches (590xc2xa0mm) in a 24xe2x80x91hour period; this established a new one-day rainfall record in the state a station in miami recorded 1218xc2xa0inches (309xc2xa0mm) and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force the combination of winds and rain damaged 5 of the local citrus and avocado crop{1] the rainfall flooded streets homes and commercial buildings in the miami area and hundreds of people were left without telephone access{11] no impact was reported in the bahamas{1]after a reanalysis of hurricanes between 1921 and 1925 the national hurricane centers atlantic reanalysis project determined this hurricane attained winds of 165xc2xa0mph (270xc2xa0kmh) making it a category 5 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale the hurricane is the earliest known to have attained the intensity besting the 1928 okeechobee hurricane which was previously thought to be the earliest storm of this intensity it is also one of only two on record to make landfall in cuba at categoryxc2xa05 status with the other being hurricane irma of 2017 which was slightly weaker at landfall having maximum sustained winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){12]{1] a hurricane in 1846 that hit the country was also thought to have struck at categoryxc2xa05 status although the storm existed prior to the start of the atlantic hurricane database{13] when the steamship "toledo" recorded an atmospheric pressure of 922xc2xa0mbar (2722xc2xa0inhg) in the storm it was the lowest pressure recorded in an atlantic hurricane breaking the previous record of 924 mbar (2728 inhg) in the atlantic hurricane of 1853 the record during this storm lasted until the 1932 cuba hurricane when a pressure of 915xc2xa0mbar (2702xc2xa0inhg) was reported{14] the reading of 932 mbar (2752 inhg) at los arroyos in mantua pinar del rxc3xado remains the lowest pressure recorded on land in cuba{15]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneslist of florida hurricanes (1900-1949)hurricane irmareferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h steve feuer;
