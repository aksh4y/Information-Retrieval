catastrophic cape verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic since wilma in 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds it was the first categoryxc2xa05 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record and the costliest caribbean hurricane{1] until hurricane maria only two weeks later it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the united states since katrina in 2005 and the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in 2005 the ninth named storm fourth hurricane second major hurricane and first categoryxc2xa05 hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime particularly in parts of the northeastern caribbean and the florida keysirma developed on august 30 2017 near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west african coast three days prior{2]{3]{4] under favorable conditions irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation becoming a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale within a mere 24xc2xa0hours irma became a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane (and therefore a major hurricane) shortly afterward; however the intensity fluctuated between categoriesxc2xa02 and 3 for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles on september 4 irma resumed intensifying becoming a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane by early the next day on september 6 irma reached its peak intensity with 185xc2xa0mph (295xc2xa0kmh) winds and a minimum pressure of 914xc2xa0hpa (270xc2xa0inhg) making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide so far in 2017 behind only hurricane maria and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed another eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken back to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane but the storm attained categoryxc2xa05 status for a second time before making landfall in cuba after dropping to categoryxc2xa03 intensity due to land interaction the storm re-intensified to categoryxc2xa04 status as it crossed warm waters between cuba and florida before making landfall on cudjoe key with maximum sustained winds at 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) irma dropped back to categoryxc2xa03 by the time it made a second florida landfall on marco island irma weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane later that day the first time it weakened below major hurricane status in over a week and eventually dissipated off the coast of new england on september 16the storm caused catastrophic damage in barbuda saint barthxc3xa9lemy saint martin anguilla and the virgin islands as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane{5]{6] as of october 10 the hurricane has caused at least 134 deaths: one in anguilla one in barbados three in barbuda four in the british

saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe national hurricane center (nhc) began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa on august 26{7] this wave moved off the coast of the continent late on august 27 throughout the next two days showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low pressure area as the system passed just south of and then through the cape verde islands on august 29{8] with the nhc stating that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression{9] further organization over the next 24 hours or so led to classification of the disturbance as tropical storm irma at 15:00xc2xa0utc on august 30 based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates{10] with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear strengthening was anticipated with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier aira viirs satellite image of hurricane irma on septemberxc2xa03the nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow as an anticyclone became established over the system with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images{11] early on august 31 shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (cdo) and an eye feature irma rapidly intensified beginning at 09:00xc2xa0utc on august 31 with winds increasing from 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) in only 12 hours{12] on september 2 a ship passed 60xc2xa0mi (90xc2xa0km) to the west of the center of irma recording maximum winds of 45xc2xa0mph (70xc2xa0kmh) which indicated that the eye of irma remained compact{13]{14] a strengthening subtropical ridge over the central north atlantic pushed irma from a western to southwestern direction on september 2 and 3{15]{16]{17]{18] the first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from barbados on the afternoon of september 3 discovering an eye 29xc2xa0mi (47xc2xa0km) in diameter

hurricaneon september 4 after moving into more favorable conditions irma strengthened into a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{20] as it continued approaching the leeward islands irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification becoming a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane by 11:45xc2xa0utc on the following day with winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh){21] as it began to take on annular characteristics the extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify{22] with maximum sustained winds peaking at 185xc2xa0mph (295xc2xa0kmh) near 00:00xc2xa0utc on september 6 xe2x80x93 which would remain steady and unchanged for the next 37 hours six hours later irma made landfall along the northern coast of barbuda near peak strength{23] later that day around 21:00xc2xa0utc the storm's pressure bottomed out at 914xc2xa0hpa (270xc2xa0inhg) xe2x80x93 this was the lowest in the atlantic since dean in 2007 while maintaining its intensity irma made successive landfalls at approximately

september 8 irma made landfall on the bahamian island little inagua{24] about three hours later an eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane but the storm regained categoryxc2xa05 status 18 hours later before making landfall in cuba after weakening to a categoryxc2xa03 due to land interaction with cuba irma reintensified into a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane while crossing over the straits of florida at 13:10xc2xa0utc on september 10 irma made landfall in cudjoe key florida with maximum sustained winds of 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) and a central pressure of 929xc2xa0hpa (274xc2xa0inhg){25] later that day at 19:35xc2xa0utc irma made landfall in marco island with maximum sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) and a central pressure of 940xc2xa0hpa

september 12 irma weakened to a tropical depression over the georgia-alabama border and degenerated into a post-tropical low about 24 hours later north of tupelo mississippi{27] irma's remnants continued moving towards the northwest over the next day before turning northward and then accelerating to the northeast on september 14{28] early on september 15 irma's remnants began moving off the new england coastline becoming increasingly disorganized while continuing to weaken later on the same day irma's remnants began interacting with a cold front stretching over newfoundland{29] on september 16 irma's remnant circulation collapsed and the majority of irma's remnant moisture was absorbed into hurricane jose later that day{30]data collected by nasa showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of irma were above 30xc2xa0xc2xb0c (86xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at the time more than enough to sustain a category 5 hurricane{31] additionally ocean surface temperatures in areas along the strait of florida extended to 32xc2xa0xc2xb0c (90xc2xa0xc2xb0f){32]{33] which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour (320xc2xa0kmh) if ideal conditions had been met{34]preparationscaribbeangiven that irma's forecast track was along much of the caribbean island chain hurricane warnings were issued for the northern leeward islands puerto rico and parts of

united states virgin islands supplies including food rations medical supplies and blankets were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution{37]in antigua and barbuda residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by september 5 to assist with any evacuations{38] expecting a direct hit more than half of the residents on barbuda took shelter{39] and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized{40]in guadeloupe low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion schools and public businesses closed on september 5 and 6 hospitals stocked up on three days' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators{41]{42] of the island's 32 municipalities 22 activated their emergency plans; 1500 people were urged to take shelter{43] the island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on st martin (collectivity of saint martin) and st barts (saint barthxc3xa9lemy){44]though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island a yellow alert was issued for martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas{45] the island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of guadeloupe saint martin and saint barthxc3xa9lemy which faced a greater risk of a direct impact{46] the national emergency management organization on saint lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf{47] small craft warnings and high surf advisories were hoisted for dominica where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves landslides and flooding{48]in the turks and caicos evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting september 5 schools were closed government buildings were boarded up and shelters were opened{49] officials spread warnings to residents in english creole and spanish via social media radio sms text and whatsapp{50]on september 5 the dominican republic activated the international charter on space and major disasters thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage;{51] the united states and haiti followed suit two days later{52]{53] according to officials 11200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm's arrival{54] 7400 tourists were moved to santo domingo away from beach resorts{55]in haiti government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts while some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population others "admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of irma's approach" per the guardian{55]{56] local officials contended that they had not received promised funds supplies or equipment from the national government the united nations stabilization mission in haiti prepared its 1000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist{57]in the bahamas the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane's arrival including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters{58] by september 7 the government had evacuated 1609 people by air from the southern islands including 365 from bimini{59] controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm{60] shelters were made available though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands{61] of the 2679 foreign tourists still in the bahamas on september 7 about 1200 were being housed at atlantis paradise island one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country{62]in cuba meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit{63] fuel conservation was enacted in camagxc3xbcey province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages{64] the civil defense evacuated

evening of september 8 hundreds of thousands of floridians had evacuated making it the largest evacuation in the state's history{74] evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound interstate 95 interstate 75 and florida's turnpike exacerbated by the fact that the entire florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the national hurricane center's forecast path in the days before the storm so evacuees from both coasts headed north as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast{89]{90]{91]{92] fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular florida during the week before irma's arrival especially along evacuation routes leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the florida highway patrol{89]{92]{93] use of

start of the 2017 hurricane season was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations the shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic{98]{95]officials from the environmental protection agency which had been criticized for its response to hurricane harvey took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials especially at superfund sites{99]elsewhereeastbound interstate 4 lanes on the afternoon of september 9 are filled with evacuating

later that afternoon prime minister gaston browne surveyed the territory by helicopter revealing an effectively uninhabitable island irma damaged or destroyed 95 of the structures on barbuda including its hospital schools and both of its hotels;{152] it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others{153]{154] the destruction rendered the island's sole airport and much of its
