and the southeast united states it formed over the eastern atlantic near the cape verde islands on september 9 1989 hugo moved thousands of miles across the atlantic rapidly strengthening to briefly attain category 5 hurricane strength on its journey it later crossed over guadeloupe and st croix on september 17 and 18 as a category 4 hurricane weakening slightly more it passed over puerto rico as a strong category 3 hurricane further weakening occurred several hours after re-emerging into the atlantic becoming downgraded to a category 2 hurricane however it re-strengthened into a category 4 hurricane before making landfall just slightly north of charleston on isle of palms on september 21 with 140xc2xa0mph sustained winds (gusts to more than 160xc2xa0mph) it had devolved to a remnant low near lake erie by the next day as of 2016 hurricane hugo is the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the east coast north of florida since 1900{1]hurricane hugo caused 34 fatalities (most by electrocution or drowning) in the caribbean and 27 in south carolina{2] left nearly 100000 homeless and resulted in 10xc2xa0billion (1989 usd) in damage overall making it the most damaging hurricane ever recorded at the time{3] of this total 7xc2xa0billion was from the united states and puerto rico ranking it as the costliest storm to impact the country at the time since 1989 however it has been surpassed by multiple storms and now ranks as the eleventh costliest in the united states{4]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 caribbean311 guadeloupe312 montserrat313 united

intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalehurricane hugo originated as a tropical wave (which also spawned hurricane raymond) which moved off the west coast of africa on september 9 soon after moving off the african coast it was classified as tropical depression eleven southeast of the cape verde islands winds were initially 30xc2xa0mph (48xc2xa0kmh) but they reached 35xc2xa0mph (56xc2xa0kmh) soon after moving on a steady westward track at 18 knots (21xc2xa0mph 33 kh) tropical depression eleven steadily intensified becoming tropical storm hugo on september 11 at 1800 utc on september 13 hugo rapidly intensified and reached hurricane strength 1265 miles (2035xc2xa0km) east of the leeward islands a low-pressure area to the south caused hugo to gradually turn to the west-northwest while the storm was slowly strengthening shortly after hurricane hugo began to rapidly intensify; 24 hours after it was classified as a hurricane it had become a category 2 hurricane after this bout of rapid strengthening hugo began to rapidly deepen becoming a major hurricane early the next morning{1]after becoming a major hurricane and maintaining category 3 strength for a day hugo reached category 4 strength and began to rapidly intensify again while moving slowly west-northwest becoming a category 5 hurricane its maximum sustained winds had increased to 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) and the minimum central pressure had dropped to 918 millibars (271xc2xa0inhg) in the early hours of september 17 hugo crossed in between guadeloupe and montserrat while its winds were near 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) when hurricane-force winds extended only 45xc2xa0mi (72xc2xa0km) from the center less than 24 hours later it made another landfall on the island of st croix with the same intensity that day hurricane hugo also made landfalls in puerto rico in vieques and fajardo though it was slightly weaker{1]hugo began to accelerate to the northwest soon after exiting eastern puerto rico on september 18 the hurricane was located a couple of hundred miles east of florida when it began a more northward track in response to a steering flow associated with an upper-level low pressure area that was moving across the southeastern united states hugo then began to strengthen again and it reached a secondary peak at 1800 utc on september 21 as a category 4 hurricane the maximum sustained winds were 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) while the minimum central pressure was 944 millibars (279xc2xa0inhg) on september 22 at 0400 utc hugo made landfall on sullivan's island south carolina{5] at its secondary peak as a category 4 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale with 140-mph sustained winds and a central pressure of 934 millibars (276xc2xa0inhg)the storm continued inland and weakened to a very strong tropical storm as it passed over charlotte north carolina{5] hugo continued on the weakening trend and weakened to a tropical storm later on the same day over central north carolina the storm continued weakening as it moved inland and on september 23 the storm weakened to a remnant low its remnant low continued to accelerate north and it reached the far northern atlantic before dissipating on september 25{1]preparations{edit]late on september 15 the national weather service office in san juan puerto rico issued a hurricane watch on the following day it was upgraded to a hurricane warning in addition the civil defense office of puerto rico activated its disaster interagency committee and began to evacuate coastal residents savannah was evacuated in anticipation of hugo but saw no effects of the storm other than isolated and light showers had hugo hit savannah it would have been the first major hurricane to make landfall in georgia since hurricane seven of the 1898 season governor carroll campbell of south carolina ordered an evacuation of the south carolina coast in advance of the storm{6]impact{edit]impact by country or region(estimates){7]countyregiondeathsdamagesourceantigua and barbuda10100xc2xa0millionguadeloupe12880xc2xa0millionmontserrat10200xc2xa0millionsaint kitts and

mainland united states and puerto rico at the time it was the costliest hurricane in us history but was exceeded in 1992 by hurricane andrew and by seven other storms since then it remains the eleventh costliest hurricane in us history an additional 3xc2xa0billion of damages was reported throughout the caribbean therefore total damages from the storm were near 10xc2xa0billion (1989 us){3]sources differ on the number of people killed by hugo with some citing the american meteorological society's figure of 49 and others claiming 56 deaths{8]caribbean{edit]severe damage was reported throughout the islands of the caribbean the storm caused an estimated 3xc2xa0billion in damages in the caribbean (including 18xc2xa0billion in the usvi){3] the storm also took usvi television station wbnb-tv off the air by destroying their transmitterguadeloupe{edit]at 1 am ast on september 17 1989 hurricane hugo made a direct landfall on grande-terre in guadeloupe pounding the island with incredibly ferocious category 4 sustained winds of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) a storm surge of up to eightxc2xa0ft (25 m) topped by high battering waves smashed ashore hugo wreaked massive devastation on the island especially in la dxc3xa9sirade and grande-terre the hurricane damaged 30 of the buildings on the island and completely destroyed 10000 homes (most of which were archaic houses) leaving a total of at least 90000 or nearly 30 of the island's 340000 people seriously affected with 35000 rendered homeless 70 of the businesses sustained damages including hotels schools and churches five people died and 107 were injured an additional seven people were killed three days after the storm when a medical helicopter crashed while evacuating victims in la dxc3xa9sirade the storm almost completely destroyed (80) the towns of le moule and saint-franxc3xa7ois on the island's eastern end debris blocked at least 30 of the island's roads agriculture suffered massive losses that took years to recover from as hugo flattened 100 of the banana crop 50 of the sugar cane crop and destroyed nearly all of the island's coconut palms in addition most of guadeloupe's fishing fleet was wiped out total damage to the island from hugo amounted to 4 billions francs or 880 million (1989 usd)hugo's winds knocked the airport control tower out of commission; raizet airport anenometer experienced 90xc2xa0mph (144xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds as well as a 117xc2xa0mph (187xc2xa0kmh) sustained gust before failing minimal pressure fell to 943 mb (2779 inhg) as the eye passed after midnight{1] in a french navy marine vessel in pointe-xc3xa0-pitre bay gusts reported to reach 184xc2xa0mph (296xc2xa0kmh)hugo was the strongest storm to impact guadeloupe since hurricane cleo (1964) and the worst storm since hurricane inez (1966) in addition it was the strongest hurricane to hit the island since the legendary 1899 the longest-lived atlantic hurricane of all time and the 1928 stormmontserrat{edit]strong winds from hugo pounded the british dependent territory of montserrat nearly every home on the island was damaged to some degree leaving 11000 out of 12000xc2xa0people over 90 of the islands residents homeless numerous schools churches the hospital the police department the government headquarters and the main power station were either destroyed or heavily damaged disrupting electrical water and telephone service for weeks a 180 feet (55xc2xa0m) stone jetty was destroyed at plymouth due to a storm surge of 20 feet (61xc2xa0m) inland rainfall up to 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm) created mudslides at the foot of chances peak destroying 21xc2xa0homes ten people were killed 89xc2xa0were injured and damage reached at least 260xc2xa0million making it the most expensive hurricane in the history of montserrat tourism and agriculture also suffered significantly{9] additionally the local bat population was devastated with an estimated 90 percent decrease in numbers after hugo's passage{10]{11] the species chiroderma improvisum has not been seen on montserrat since and it is feared that it may be extinct on the island{12]united states virgin islands{edit]the slower speed allowed hugo to punish the island of st croix with the worst beating of any location along the hurricane's destructive path at 2 am local time on september 18 hugo's eyewall struck st croix bringing category 4 winds sustained at 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) the hurricane's gusts were remarkably violent and many residents witnessed tornado-like vortices barreling across the island as the hurricane raged about them a storm surge of 2xe2x80x933xc2xa0ft (061xe2x80x93091xc2xa0m) topped by battering waves 20xe2x80x9323xc2xa0ft (61xe2x80x9370xc2xa0m) high assaulted the coast adding to the destruction two people were killed on st croix 80 injured and 90 of the buildings were damaged or destroyed damage estimates for st croix were astronomical over 1 billion and the island's entire infrastructure was virtually wiped out six weeks after the hurricane only 25 of the public roads had been cleared and only 25 of the island had power"{13]on the island of st thomas the damage was bad but not nearly as extensive television station wbnb-tv channel 10 (the local cbs affiliate) had its transmitter completely destroyed by hurricane hugo the station would not return to the air because of the damages and the owners' inability to afford repairs many business were destroyed west indies transport had operated several businesses in krum bay st thomas including a dry dock a ship repair facility and a barge towing company in united states v west indies transport inc 96 7063 wit 96 7064 96 7065 it was written that "hurricane hugo seriously damaged some of the barges shifting them from their permitted positions west indies transport did not attempt to repair reposition or salvage these barges after the storm instead it used these barges as docks repair facilities and housing for employees in their new unauthorized locations" {14] the company officers were charged and convicted of environmental and other crimes and ordered to pay restitution in excess of a million dollars to the us in 1997puerto rico{edit]rainfall totals from hugo in puerto ricodamage in puerto rico was severe especially in the eastern part of the island naval station roosevelt roads had heavy damage to include loss of control tower capability for the airfield necessitating employment of a temporary control tower during recovery efforts{15] the agricultural sector was devastated with the banana and coffee crops being almost completely wiped out heavy rains caused severe flooding in the vicinity of san juan; in addition several roads and bridges were washed away{11]in all 12 deaths in puerto rico are attributed to hugo{7] six of which occurred in the southern city of guayama where some residents were electrocuted by downed power lines nearly 28000 people were left homeless by the storm as damages exceeded 1 billion{11]most severe landfalling atlantic hurricanes in the united statesbased on size and intensity for total points on the hurricane severity

states (mainland){edit]the storm caused 7xc2xa0billion in damage in the united states surpassing hurricane frederic of 1979 as the costliest tropical cyclone in that country hugo itself was surpassed by hurricane andrew in 1992 and several others over the next few decades{17] south carolina suffered the worst impact where hugo made landfall as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane in that state alone 3307xc2xa0single family homes were destroyed 18171xc2xa0were inflicted major damage and 56580xc2xa0sustained minor impact while more than 12600xc2xa0mobile homes and 18000xc2xa0multixe2x80x93family houses were either damaged or destroyed{18] losses reached at least 59xc2xa0billion and there were thirty-five fatalities reported in south carolina{19]{20] there was also significant impact in north carolina where 205xc2xa0structures were destroyed 1149xc2xa0were severely damaged and 2638xc2xa0suffered minor losses{20] one fatality occurred and damage in north carolina reached about 1xc2xa0billion{21]florida and georgia{edit]impact in florida was minimal the highest sustained winds in the state reached only 21xc2xa0mph (34xc2xa0kmh) in jacksonville at the same location a trace of rainfall was also reported conditions were even lesser in st augustine though wind gusts were slightly higher than in jacksonville to the north in georgia minor storm surge was reported with the highest measured as 14 feet (043xc2xa0m) above normal in fort pulaski sustained winds of 58xc2xa0mph (93xc2xa0kmh) was reported at the tybee island lighthouse and this was the only record of tropical storm force winds in georgia near tropical storm force winds were measured at the savannahhilton head international airport along with 61 inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rain high winds in brunswick downed five trees one of which struck a house additionally winds felled at least 50xc2xa0trees in the savannah area and two homes were struck scattered downed tree limbs were also reported in hinesville and bryan county though no damage occurred{20]south carolina{edit]mobile homes destroyed by hugo's storm surgebecause it was a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane at landfall the storm brought strong winds to many areas of south carolina in downtown charleston sustained winds of 87xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) were reported along with gusts of 108xc2xa0mph (174xc2xa0kmh) the local national weather service office at charleston international airport recorded sustained winds of 78xc2xa0mph (126xc2xa0kmh) and gusts up to 97xc2xa0mph (156xc2xa0kmh) in folly beach sustained winds of 85xc2xa0mph (137xc2xa0kmh) and a gust of 107xc2xa0mph (172xc2xa0kmh) were reported the strongest wind gust of 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) was recorded by the snow goose which was anchored along the sampit river near georgetown extensive property damage was reported in several counties especially in the south carolina lowcountry and the grand strand more than 227800xc2xa0residences experienced power outages and 85 of bamberg and orangeburg counties were left without electricity while marion county became completely void of electrical services{20] extensive losses reaching 1xc2xa0billion were reported at francis marion national forest where about 8800 square miles (23000xc2xa0km2) of trees were downed enough timber to build 660000xc2xa0homes{22]hugo proved to be devastating to beachfront propertystorm surge and rough tides also caused extensive damage especially in charleston county the highest storm surge observation was 202 feet (62xc2xa0m) at seewee bay near mcclellanville prior to the storm residents of mcclellanville took shelter in the cafeteria at lincoln high school however storm surge flooded the room with some people climbing up to the rafters for safety a portion of the ben sawyer bridge xe2x80x93 linking mount pleasant to sullivan's island xe2x80x93 collapsed due to strong winds and storm surge on sullivan's island water destroyed two or three rows of beach houses in some areas at isle of palms boats harbored at the marina were washed ashore and piled into a large heap losses at sullivan's island and isle of palms reached nearly 270xc2xa0million{20]rainfall was moderate due to the storm's fast motion peaking at 1028xc2xa0in (261xc2xa0mm) at edisto island{23] no widespread flooding was reported though a combination of rain and strong winds resulted in significant agriculture losses the red cross estimates that 3307xc2xa0single family homes were destroyed 18171xc2xa0were inflicted major damage and 56580xc2xa0sustained minor impact additionally more than 12600xc2xa0mobile homes and 18000xc2xa0multi-family houses were either damaged or destroyed{18] damage from hurricane hugo in south carolina was estimated at 59xc2xa0billion{19] hugo remains the strongest and costliest hurricane in the history of the state{24] there were 35xc2xa0deaths two from asphyxiation four from collapsing houses two from falling trees nine from fire and smoke inhalation six from drowning four from electrocutions six from heart attacks one fatal accidental selfxe2x80x93injury during cleanxe2x80x93up and one from unknown cause{20]north carolina{edit]rainfall totals from hugo in the continental united statesnorth carolina's coastline suffered significant damage along its southward-facing beaches including brunswick county and the outer banks{citation needed]the storm reached charlotte at 3 am{25] only six hours after landfall by this time it was still a fairly strong tropical storm with sustained winds of 54xc2xa0mph (87xc2xa0kmh) and gusts of 87xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh){26] this was enough to topple trees across roads and houses leaving many without power closing schools for as long as two weeks and spawning several tornadoes charlotte is roughly 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) inland and many coastal residents from both carolinas went there to wait out the stormby 7:00 am it was still strong enough to cause heavy rain and tear down hundreds of trees in conover{27]damages in that state alone estimated at 1xc2xa0billion (1989 usd 193xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd){21]mid-atlantic{edit]the ocean liner queen elizabeth 2 which had sailed from southampton on september 17 encountered the hurricane and was delayed for two extra days at sea having initially attempted to sail at full speed south to outrun the storm and cross the atlantic behind it to new york the ship had much damage to the public parts of the vessel including the shops and the bridge; the swimming pools were all emptied to prevent large amounts of water shifting precariously as the ship pitched and tossed hugo moved quickly through western virginia west virginia and eastern ohio to erie pennsylvania by the evening of september 22 it became an extratropical cyclone hugo caused schools in southwest virginia to be closed for more than two weeks because of the wind and flooding damage winds peaked at 37xc2xa0mph (60xc2xa0kmh) at ronald reagan washington national airport{28]in new york downed power lines due to strong winds left nearly 85000xc2xa0homes and businesses on long island without electricity in the central portions of the state winds downed several trees the last death in relation to hurricane hugo occurred near buffalo when the winds toppled a tree onto a motorist the storm then moved northeastward across eastern canada into the far north atlantic ocean{29]new england{edit]in connecticut wind gusts associated with the remnants of hugo peaked at 49xc2xa0mph (79xc2xa0kmh) in bridgeport the winds caused minor property damage while falling trees and tree limbs briefly left up to 30000xc2xa0customers without electricity gusty winds in massachusetts left several thousand people without power while also toppling trees and tree limbs which caused minor damage to houses and cars additionally apple orchards were impacted with some losing up to their 30 of their crops strong winds throughout the state of vermont downed power lines trees and tree limbs some boats on lake champlain were torn from their moorings due to swells up to several feet in height in rhode island the outer fringes of the remnants of hugo produced wind gusts between 40 and 50xc2xa0mph (64 and 80xc2xa0kmh) causing minor property damage and scattered power outagescanada{edit]ontario{edit]after becoming extratropical the remnants of hugo entered canada into the province of ontario in the niagara falls area winds between 37 and 43xc2xa0mph (60 and 70xc2xa0kmh) were reported winds near 47xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) were also reported in toronto heavy rainfall also occurred in ontario with precipitation in ontario peaking at 45xc2xa0in (110xc2xa0mm) while a maximum amount of 185xc2xa0in (47xc2xa0mm) was reported in toronto as a result of the storm blackouts and car accidents were reported in toronto furthermore heavy rains and high winds also occurred across the southern portions of ontario{30]quebec{edit]the remnants of hugo tracked northeastward and entered the canadian province of quebec in montreal rainfall reached only 043xc2xa0in (11xc2xa0mm) while precipitation amounts in the province peaked at 373xc2xa0in (95xc2xa0mm) in addition to light rain high winds were reported in the province winds in montreal gusted up to 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) leaving 13400 homes without electricity 7400 residence in verdun and west island also lost electricity when tree fell on power lines; it was restored about 12 hours later while in brossard and chambly power was lost to 5000 homes and 1000 homes in valleyfield in addition high winds and heavy rainfall also occurred in the st lawrence river valley{30]new brunswick and newfoundland{edit]similar effects were reported in new brunswick though little rainfall occurred in the province winds gusting to 77xc2xa0mph (124xc2xa0kmh) was reported in moncton as a result of high winds power poles were toppled and tree branches fell which caused most of new brunswick's 15000 power failures in addition several tree and signs were blown over in saint john and moncton the storm also significantly affected the apple crop in new brunswick strong winds were also reported in newfoundland with gusts recorded up to 43xc2xa0mph (69xc2xa0kmh){30]aftermath{edit]damage in charleston south carolinared cross response{edit]extensive relief aid was provided throughout by the salvation army the red cross and various churchessaint croix{edit]on the island of saint croix looting and lawlessness reigned in the aftermath of hugo{31] in operation hawkeye then-president of the united states george h w bush ordered federal forces to saint croix to suppress the violence protect property and restore law and order elements of the army navy and the coast guard along with a contingent from the us marshals service and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) formed joint task force (jtf) 40 for operation hawkeye{32] it also resulted in the first operational deployment of the national disaster medical system (ndms) when the new mexico-1 disaster medical assistance team (dmat) was deployed to assist in medical care needs of the stricken island{33] three days after the storm hit the governor of the united states virgin islands alexander farrelly asked president bush for federal assistance in restoring order to the island{32]national basketball association player tim duncan born in christiansted and a two-time nba mvp of the san antonio spurs attributed his basketball career to hurricane hugo's destruction when tim was 13 years old he was a competitive swimmer who was considered one of the top united states competitors for the 400-meter freestyle however in the aftermath of hugo every swimming pool on saint croix was destroyed including the olympic-size swimming pool with no pool to practice in duncan turned to basketball tim duncan said "i'm very fortunate to be where i am today without hugo i might still be swimming"{34] a resident of st croix recorded the hurricane and aftermath on a vhs video camera after being evacuated from the island days later the video footage was aired on wgal channel 8 from lancaster pennsylvania and picked up by nbc and aired as part of the nightly news this was credited as the first "official" eye witness footage shown on us national television about 20xc2xa0years later weather underground member jeff masters wrote and described his experience on saint croix during the hurricane noting that "in some respects after 20 years there are many aspects of the society that have yet to recover"united states{edit]after the storm governor carroll campbell said that the storm destroyed enough timber in south carolina to "frame a home for every family in the state of west virginia" an immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies so they were also downgraded into pulpwood leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased{35] in south carolina which bore the brunt of the storm the federal emergency management agency (fema) was slow in responding{citation needed] united states senator from south carolina fritz hollings referred to the agency as "a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses" during a speech on the floor of the united states senate an investigation was launched which led to some reforms in fema procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during hurricane andrew the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the united states however fema was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to hurricane katrina{36]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdue to the extensive damage the name hugo was retired following this storm
