philanthropist and a representative of king george ii to the american colonies was sent to create a buffer south of the savannah river to protect the carolinas from spanish florida and french louisianaon february 12 1733{7] general james oglethorpe and settlers from the ship anne landed at yamacraw bluff and were greeted by tomochichi the yamacraws and indian traders john and mary musgrove mary musgrove often served as an interpreter the city of savannah was founded on that date along with the colony of georgia in 1751 savannah and the rest of georgia became a royal colony and savannah was made the colonial capital of georgia{8] by the outbreak of the american revolutionary war savannah had become the southernmost commercial port of the thirteen colonies british troops took the city in 1778 and the following year a combined force of american and french soldiers failed to rout the british at the siege of savannah the british did not leave the city until july 1782{9] savannah a prosperous seaport throughout the nineteenth century was the confederacy's sixth most populous city and the prime objective of general william t sherman's march to the sea early on december 21 1864 local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save savannah from destruction and union troops marched into the city at dawn{10]savannah was named for the savannah river which probably derives from variant names for the shawnee a native american people who migrated to the river in the 1680s the shawnee destroyed another native people the westo and occupied their lands at the head of the savannah river's navigation on the fall line near present-day augusta{11] these shawnee whose native name was xc5xa0axc2xb7wanoxc2xb7ki (literally "southerners"){12] were known by several local variants including shawano savano savana and savannah{13] another theory is that the name savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland and is derived from the english term "savanna" a kind of tropical grassland which was borrowed by the english from spanish sabana and used in the southern colonies (the spanish word comes from the taino word zabana){14] still other theories suggest that the name savannah originates from algonquian terms meaning not only "southerners" but perhaps "salt"{15]{16]geography{edit]savannah lies on the savannah river approximately 20xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) upriver from the atlantic ocean{17] according to the united states census bureau (2011) the city has a total area of 1087 square miles (2815xc2xa0km2) of which 1031 square miles (2670xc2xa0km2) is land and 56 square miles (15xc2xa0km2) is water (515) savannah is the primary port on the savannah river and the largest port in the state of georgia it is also located near the us intracoastal waterway georgia's ogeechee river flows toward the atlantic ocean some 16 miles (26xc2xa0km) south of downtown savannah and forms the southern city limitsavannah is prone to flooding five canals and several pumping stations have been built to help reduce the effects: fell street canal pipe makers canal kayton canal springfield canal and casey canal the first four draining north into the savannah river and the last the casey draining south into the vernon riverclimate{edit]savannah's climate is classified as humid subtropical (kxc3xb6ppen cfa) in the deep south this is characterized by long and almost tropical summers and short mild winters savannah records few days of freezing temperatures each year (and has rare snowfall) due to its proximity to the atlantic coast savannah rarely experiences temperatures as extreme as those in georgia's interior nevertheless the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from 105xc2xa0xc2xb0f (41xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on july 20 1986 down to 3xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x9216xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on january 21 1985{18]seasonally savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses which are common although summers in savannah are frequently sunny half of savannah's annual precipitation falls during the months of june through september average dewpoints in summer range from 678xc2xa0xc2xb0f (20xc2xa0xc2xb0c) to 716xc2xa0xc2xb0f (22xc2xa0xc2xb0c) winters in savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures close to

temperatures below freezing though in some years fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing although decades might pass between snowfall events savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions most notably in december 1989 when up to 39 inches were recorded in one day in parts of the city{19]{20]savannah is at risk for hurricanes particularly of the cape verde type because of its location in the georgia bight (the arc of the atlantic coastline in georgia and northern florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as charleston south carolina savannah was seldom affected by hurricanes during the 20th century with one exception being hurricane david in 1979 however the historical record shows that the city was frequently affected during the second half of the 19th century the most prominent of these storms was the 1893 sea islands hurricane which killed at least 2000 people (this estimate may be low as deaths among the many impoverished rural african-americans living on georgia's barrier islands may not have been reported)climate data for savannah georgia (savannahhilton head
