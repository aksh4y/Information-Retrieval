university in washington prominent seattle-area residents including methodist preacher daniel bagley saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige they convinced early founder of seattle (and member of the territorial legislature) arthur a denny on the importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858in 1861 scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres (4xc2xa0ha) site in seattle to serve as a new university campus arthur and mary denny donated eight acres while fellow pioneers edward lander and charlie and mary terry donated two acres on denny's knoll in downtown seattle{7] more specifically this tract was bounded by 4th avenue to the west 6th avenue to the east union street to the north and seneca streets to the southon november 4 1861 washington opened as the territorial university of washington the legislature passed articles incorporating the university and establishing its board of regents in 1862 the school initially struggled closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage washington successfully awarded its first graduate clara antoinette mccarty wilt in 1876 with a bachelor's degree in science19th century relocation{edit]by the time washington state entered the union in 1889 both seattle and the university had grown substantially washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students and the campus's relative isolation in downtown seattle faced encroaching development a special legislative committee headed by uw graduate edmond meany was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty the committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown seattle called union bay and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and constructionalaska-yukon-pacific exposition on the uw campus toward mount rainier in 1909in 1895 the university relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built denny hall the university regents tried and failed to sell the old campus eventually settling with leasing the area this would later become one of the university's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day seattle generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the metropolitan tract the original territorial university building was torn down in 1908 and its former site now houses the fairmont olympic hotelthe sole-surviving remnants of washington's first building are four 24-foot (73xc2xa0m) white hand-fluted cedar ionic columns they were salvaged by edmond s meany one of the university's first graduates and former head of its history department meany and his colleague dean herbert t condon dubbed the columns as "loyalty" "industry" "faith" and "efficiency" or "life" the columns now stand in the sylvan grove theater{8]20th century expansion{edit]organizers of the 1909 alaska-yukon-pacific exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world's fair they came to an agreement with washington's board of regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition in exchange washington would take advantage of the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion this arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several buildings prepared in part by john charles olmsted the plan was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan permanently affecting the campus layoutaerial view of campus circa 1922both world wars brought the military to campus with certain facilities temporarily loaned to the federal government regardless subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the university{9] the period between the wars saw a significant expansion on the upper campus construction of the liberal arts quadrangle known to students as "the quad" began in 1916 and continued to 1939 the university's architectural centerpiece suzzallo library was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935 after world war ii further growth came with the gi bill among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the school of medicine in 1946 now consistently ranked as the top medical school in the united states it would eventually also led to the university of washington medical center ranked by us news and world report to be among the top ten hospitals in the nationduring this era many japanese americans were sent away to internment camps along the west coast as part of executive order 9066 following the attacks on pearl harbor many japanese american students and "soon-to-be" graduates were unable to receive diplomas or be recognized for accomplishments at the university until washington's commemoration ceremony for the japanese americans entitled the long journey home in may 2008from 1958-1973 the university of washington saw tremendous growth in students faculties operating budget and prestige under leadership of charles odegaard uw student enrollment had more than doubled to 34000 as the baby boom generation came of age however this era was also marked by high levels of student activism as was the case at many american universities much of the unrest focused around civil rights and opposition to the vietnam war{10]{11] in response to anti-vietnam war protests by the late 1960s the university safety and security division became the university of washington police department{12]odegaard instituted a vision of building a "community of scholars" convincing the washington state legislatures to increase their investments towards the university washington senators such as henry m jackson and warren g magnuson also used their political clout to build research funds for uw the results included an operating budget increase of 37 million in 1958 to over 400 million in 1973 and solidified uw as a top recipients of federal research funds in the united states even today establishment of technology giants such as microsoft boeing and amazon near uw has also proved to be highly influential not only improving graduate prospects{13]{14] but also helping to attract millions of dollars in university and research funding through its extensive list of distinguished faculty and alumni network{15]21st century{edit]the quadin 1990 the university of washington opened additional campuses in bothell and tacoma although originally intended for students who have already completed two years of higher education both

the huskyuw students sports teams and alumni are called washington huskies and often referred to metonymically as "montlake" due to the campus's location on montlake boulevard ne{99] (although the traditional bounds of the montlake neighborhood do not extend north of the montlake cut to include the campus) the husky was selected as the school mascot by student committee in 1922 it replaced the "sun dodger" an abstract reference to the local weather that was quickly dropped in favor of something more tangible the costumed "harry the husky" performs at sporting and special events and a live alaskan malamute currently named dubs has traditionally led the uw football team onto the field at the start of games the school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote the choice was inspired by the first stanza of lord byron's the destruction of sennacherib:{100]{101]the assyrian came down like the wolf on the foldand his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the seawhen the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee{100]the university of washington's costumed mascot is harry the huskythe university of washington
