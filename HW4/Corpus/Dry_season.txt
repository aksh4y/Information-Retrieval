during that time the northern tropics have a dry season with sparser precipitation and days are typically sunny throughout from april to september the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere and the southern tropics have their dry season under the kxc3xb6ppen climate classification for tropical climates a dry season month is defined as a month when average precipitation is below 60 millimetres (24xc2xa0in){1]the dry season has low humidity and some watering holes and rivers dry up this lack of water (and hence of food) may force many grazing animals to migrate to more fertile spots examples of such animals are zebras elephants{2] and wildebeest because of the lack of water in the plants bushfires are common{3]data shows that in africa the start of the dry season coincides with a rise in the cases of measlesxe2x80x94which researchers believe might be attributed to the higher concentration of people in the dry season as agricultural operations are all but impossible without irrigation during this time some farmers move into cities creating hubs of higher population density and allowing disease to spread more easily{4]the rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the tropic of cancer and as far south as the tropic of capricorn near these latitudes there is one wet season and one dry season annually at the equator there are two wet and two dry seasons as the rain belt passes over twice a year once moving north and once moving south between the tropics and the equator locations may experience a short wet and a long wet season; and a short dry and a long dry season local geography may substantially modify these climate patterns howevernew data shows that in the seasonal parts of the south american amazon forest foliage growth and coverage varies between the dry and wet seasonsxe2x80x94with about 25 more leaves and faster growth in the dry season researchers believe that the amazon itself has an effect in bringing{clarification needed] the onset of the wet season: by growing more foliage it evaporates more water{5] however this growth appears only in the undisturbed parts of the amazon basin where researchers believe roots can reach deeper and gather more rain water{6] it has also been shown that ozone levels are much higher in the dry than in the wet season in the amazon basin{7]references{edit]^ "updated world kxc3xb6ppen-geiger climate classification map" (pdf)xc2xa0^ tony rennell (june 29 2007) "it's dry season and elephants are desperately seeking water - but poachers lie in wait" london: daily mailxc2xa0^ "wet  dry seasons"xc2xa0^ "dry season brings on measles in sub-saharan africa" sciencedaily february 7 2008xc2xa0^ "amazon rainforest does have rainy and dry seasons" mongabaycom march 12 2007 archived from the original on june 4 2008xc2xa0^ "amazon rainforest greens up in the dry season"xc2xa0^ v w j h kirchhoff i m o da silva e v browell (1990) "ozone measurements in amazonia: dry season versus wet season" journal of geophysical research 95: 16913 bibcode:1990jgr9516913k doi:101029jd095id10p16913xc2xa0cs1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)vteseasonstemperate seasonsspringsummerautumnwinterscience portaltropical seasonswet seasondry seasonharmattan (west africa)specificfog seasonhurricane seasonmonsoon season retrieved from ""categories: climateseasonshidden categories: cs1 maint: multiple names: authors listarticles needing additional references from february 2008all articles needing additional referenceswikipedia articles needing clarification from august 2015 navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version in other projectswikimedia commons languagesxd8xa7xd9x84xd8xb9xd8xb1xd8xa8xd9x8axd8xa9xe0xa6xacxe0xa6xbexe0xa6x82xe0xa6xb2xe0xa6xbexd0x91xd1x8axd0xbbxd0xb3xd0xb0xd1x80xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8catalxc3xa0xc4x8cexc5xa1tinadanskdeutschdolnoserbskiespaxc3xb1olesperantoeuskaraxd9x81xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cfranxc3xa7aisxedx95x9cxeaxb5xadxecx96xb4hornjoserbscebahasa indonesiaitalianoxe1x83xa5xe1x83x90xe1x83xa0xe1x83x97xe1x83xa3xe1x83x9axe1x83x98kiswahilixe0xbaxa5xe0xbaxb2xe0xbaxa7lingxc3xa1lamagyarxd0x9cxd0xb0xd0xbaxd0xb5xd0xb4xd0xbexd0xbdxd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8bahasa melayunederlandsxe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9enorsknorsk nynorskpolskiportuguxc3xaasromxc3xa2nxc4x83runa simixd0xa0xd1x83xd1x81xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8xd0xb9scotsxe0xb7x83xe0xb7x92xe0xb6x82xe0xb7x84xe0xb6xbdslovenxc4x8dinabasa sundasuomisvenskatagalogxe0xb9x84xe0xb8x97xe0xb8xa2xd0xa3xd0xbaxd1x80xd0xb0xd1x97xd0xbdxd1x81xd1x8cxd0xbaxd0xb0tixe1xbaxbfng vixe1xbbx87twinarayxe4xb8xadxe6x96x87 edit links  this page was last edited on 24 october 2017 at 15:42text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
