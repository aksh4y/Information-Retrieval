tajiki since the soviet era){9] and some other regions which historically were persianate societies and considered part of greater iran it is written in the persian alphabet a modified variant of the arabic scriptthe persian language is classified as a continuation of middle persian the official religious and literary language of the sasanian empire itself a continuation of old persian the language of the achaemenid empire{10]{11]{12] its grammar is similar to that of many contemporary european languages{13] persian gets its name from its origin at the capital of the achaemenid empire persis (modern-day fars province) hence the name persian (farsi){14] a persian-speaking person may be referred to as persophone{15]there are approximately 110 million persian speakers worldwide with the language holding official status in iran afghanistan and tajikistan for centuries persian has also been a prestigious cultural language in other regions of western asia central asia and south asia by the various empires based in the regions{16]persian has had a considerable (mainly lexical) influence on neighboring languages particularly the turkic languages in central asia caucasus and anatolia neighboring iranian languages as well as armenian georgian and indo-aryan languages especially urdu (a register of hindustani) it also exerted some influence on arabic particularly bahrani arabic{17] while borrowing much vocabulary from it after the arab conquest of iran{10]{13]{18]{19]{20]{21]{22]with a long history of literature in the form of middle persian before islam persian was the first language in the muslim world to break through arabic's monopoly on writing and the writing of poetry in persian was established as a court tradition in many eastern courts{16] some of the famous works of persian literature are the shahnameh of ferdowsi the works of rumi the rubaiyat of omar khayyam the panj ganj of nizami ganjavi the divxc4x81n of hafez and the two miscellanea of prose

persian{edit]in persian the language is known by several names:western persian parsi (xd9xbexd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cxe2x80x8e pxc4x81rsi) or farsi (xd9x81xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cxe2x80x8e fxc4x81rsi

in english have referred to the variety of persian spoken in iran as farsi;{24]{25] although the name persian is also still widely used{26]{27]{28]eastern persian dari persian

20th century has become the name for the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan where it is one of the two official languages; it is sometimes called afghan persian in english{29]tajiki

english{edit]persian the historically more widely used name of the language in english is an anglicized form derived from latin persianus < latin persia < greek xcexa0xcexb5xcfx81xcfx83xcexafxcfx82 persxc3xads "persia"{30] a hellenized form of old persian pxc4x81rsa{31] according to the oxford english dictionary the term persian as a language name is first attested in english in the mid-16th century{32] native iranian persian speakers call it fxc4x81rsi{33] farsi is the arabicized form of pxc4x81rsi subsequent to muslim conquest of persia due to a lack of the phoneme p in standard arabic (ie the p was replaced with an f){34]{35]{36] the origin of the name farsi and the place of origin of the language which is fars province is the arabicized form of pxc4x81rs{34]{35]{36] in english this language has historically been known as persian though farsi has also gained some currency farsi is encountered in some linguistic literature as a name for the language used both by iranian and by foreign authors{37]in modern english the word farsi refers to the language while parsi (or parsee) describes zoroastrians particularly in south asiathe academy of persian language and literature has declared that the name persian is more appropriate as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity{38] some persian language scholars such as ehsan yarshater editor of encyclopxc3xa6dia iranica and university of arizona professor kamran talattof have also rejected the usage of "farsi" in their articles{39]{40]the international language-encoding standard iso 639-1 uses the code fa as its coding system is mostly based on the local names the more detailed standard iso 639-3 uses the name "persian" (code fas) for the dialect continuum spoken across iran and afghanistan this consists of the individual languages dari (afghan persian) and iranian persian{41]currently voice of america bbc world service deutsche welle and radio free europeradio liberty use "persian service" for their broadcasts in the language radio free europeradio liberty also includes a tajik service and an afghan (dari) service this is also the case for the american association of teachers of persian the centre for promotion of persian language and literature and many of the leading scholars of the persian language{42]history{edit]history of thepersian languageproto-iranian (c 1500 bce)western iranian languagesold persian (c 525 xe2x80x93 300 bce)old persian cuneiformmiddle persian (c 300 bce xe2x80x93

the indo-iranian branch of the indo-european family of languages in general iranian languages are known from three periods usually referred to as old middle and new (modern) periods these correspond to three eras in iranian history; old era being the period from sometime before achaemenids the achaemenid era and sometime after achaemenids (that is to 400xe2x80x93300 bc) middle era being the next period most officially sassanid era and sometime in post-sassanid era and the new era being the period afterwards down to present day{43]according to available documents the persian language is "the only iranian language"{10] for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that old middle and new persian represent{10]{44] one and the same language of persian; that is new persian is a direct descendant of middle and old persian{44]the known history of the persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods:old persian{edit]main articles: old persian and persian verbsold persianas a written language old persian is attested in royal achaemenid inscriptions the oldest known text written in old persian is from the behistun inscription{45] examples of old persian have been found in what is now iran romania (gherla){46]{47]{48] armenia bahrain iraq turkey and egypt{49]{50] old persian is one of the oldest indo-european languages which is attested in original texts{51]xenophon a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc which is at a time when old persian was the only form of persian used he relates that the armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians{52]middle persian{edit]main article: middle persianthe complex grammatical conjugation and declension of old persian yielded to the structure of middle persian in which the dual number disappeared leaving only singular and plural as did gender middle persian developed the ezxc4x81fe construction expressed through xc4xab (modern ye) to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical systemalthough the "middle period" of the iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the achaemenid empire the transition from old to middle persian had probably already begun before the 4th century however middle persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the sassanid era (224xe2x80x93651) inscriptions so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty moreover as a literary language middle persian is not attested until much later to the 6th or 7th century and from the 8th century onward middle persian gradually began yielding to new persian with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of zoroastrianismthe native name of middle persian was parsig or parsik after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest that is "of pars" old persian parsa new persian fars this is the origin of the name farsi as it is today used to signify new persian following the collapse of the sassanid state parsik came to be applied exclusively to (either middle or new) persian that was written in the arabic script from about the 9th century onward as middle persian was on the threshold of becoming new persian the older form of the language came to be erroneously called pahlavi which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both middle persian as well as various other middle iranian languages that writing system had previously been adopted by the sassanids (who were persians ie from the southwest) from the preceding arsacids (who were parthians ie from the northeast) while ibn al-muqaffa' (eighth century) still distinguished between pahlavi (ie parthian) and persian (in arabic text: al-farisiyah) (ie middle persian) this distinction is not evident in arab commentaries written after that dategernot windfuhr considers new persian as an evolution of the old persian language and the middle persian language{53] but also states that none of the known middle persian dialects is the direct predecessor of modern persian{54]{55] ludwig paul states: "the language of the shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from middle to new persian"{56]new persian{edit]ferdowsi's shahnameh"new persian" is conventionally divided into three stages:early new persian (8th9th centuries)classical persian (10thxe2x80x9318th centuries)contemporary persian (19th century to present)early new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable{57]early new persian{edit]"new persian" is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under abbasid rule{58] with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called dari the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of greater iran in greater khorasan and transoxiana close to the amu darya (modern day afghanistan){59]the mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from middle into new persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of iranian origin the tahirid dynasty (820xe2x80x93872) saffarid dynasty (860xe2x80x93903) and samanid empire (874xe2x80x93999) and could develop only in range and power of expression{59]abbas of merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of hanzala badghisi were among the most famous between the persian-speakers of the time{60]the first poems of the persian language a language historically called dari emerged in afghanistan{61] the first significant persian poet was rudaki he flourished in the 10th century when the samanids were at the height of their power his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved among his lost works is versified fables collected in the kalila wa dimna{16]the language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture new persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century{58] in the late middle ages new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model: ottoman turkish chagatai and urdu which are regarded as "structural daughter languages" of persian{58]classical persian{edit]see also: list of persian poets and authorskalilah va dimna an influential work in persian literature"classical persian" loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval persia used in literature and poetry this is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the "persianized" turko-mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries and under restored persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries{62]persian during this time served as lingua franca of greater persia and of much of the indian subcontinent it was also the official and cultural language of many islamic dynasties including the samanids buyids tahirids ziyarids the mughal empire timurids ghaznavids seljuqs khwarazmians the sultanate of rum the shirvanshahs safavids afsharids zands qajars ottomans and also many mughal successors such as the nizam of hyderabad persian was the only non-european language known and used by marco polo at the court of kublai khan and in his journeys through china{63]use in asia minor{edit]persian on an ottoman miniaturedespite anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the middle ages by various persian-speaking dynasties originating in iran the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the sasanian empire centuries later however the practise and usage of persian in the region would be strongly revived a branch of the seljuks the sultanate of rum took persian language art and letters to anatolia{64] they adopted persian language as the official language of the empire{65] the ottomans which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors took this tradition over persian was the official court language of the empire and for some time the official language of the empire{66] the educated and noble class of the ottoman empire all spoke persian such as sultan selim i despite being safavid iran's archrival and a staunch opposer of shia islam{67] it was a major literary language in the empire{68] some of the noted earlier persian works during the ottoman rule are idris bidlisi's hasht bihisht which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight ottoman rulers and the salim-namah a glorification of selim i{67] after a period of several centuries ottoman turkish (which was highly persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation{69] however the number of persian and arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88{69]use in south asia{edit]main article: persian language in south asiasee also: persian and urdupersian poem agra fort india 18th centurypersian poem takht-e shah jahan agra fort indiathe persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in west asia europe central asia and south asia following the turko-persian ghaznavid conquest of south asia persian was firstly introduced in the region by turkic central asians{70] the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianized central asian turkic and afghan dynasties{64] for five centuries prior to the british colonization persian was widely used as a second language in the indian subcontinent due to the admiration the mughals (who were of turco-mongol origin) had for the foreign language it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole "official language" under the mughal emperors beginning in 1843 though english and hindustani gradually replaced persian in importance on the subcontinent{71] evidence of persian's historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the indian subcontinent words borrowed from persian are still quite commonly used in certain indo-aryan languages especially urdu also historically known as hindustani there is also a small population of zoroastrian iranis in india who migrated around 16th-18th century to escape religious execution in qajar iran and speak a dari dialectcontemporary persian{edit]a variant of the iranian standard isiri 9147 keyboard layout for persianin the 19th century under the qajar dynasty the dialect spoken in tehran rose to prominence this became the basis of what is now known as "contemporary standard persian"there is still substantial arabic vocabulary but many of these words have been integrated into persian phonology and grammar in addition since the 19thxc2xa0century numerous russian french and english terms have been borrowed especially vocabulary related to technology the iranian national academy of persian language and literature is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their persian equivalentsvarieties{edit]there are three modern varieties of standard persian:western persian (persian iranian persian or farsi) is spoken in iran and by minorities in iraq and the persian gulf statesdari (dari persian afghan persian or dari) is spoken in afghanistantajiki (tajik persian) is spoken in tajikistan and uzbekistan it is written in the cyrillic scriptall these three varieties are based on the classic persian literature and its literary tradition there are also several local dialects from iran afghanistan and tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard persian the hazaragi dialect (in central afghanistan and pakistan) herati (in western afghanistan) darwazi (in afghanistan and tajikistan) and the tehrani accent (in iran the basis of standard iranian persian) are examples of these dialects persian-speaking peoples of iran afghanistan and tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility{72]the following are some languages closely related to persian or in some cases are considered dialects:luri (or lori) spoken mainly in the southwestern iranian provinces of lorestan kohgiluyeh and boyer-ahmad province some western parts of fars province and some parts of khuzestan provincelari (in southern iran)tat spoken in parts of azerbaijan russia and transcaucasia it is classified as a variety of persian{73]{74]{75]{76]{77]judeo-tat part of the tat persian continuum and spoken in azerbaijan russia as well as notably by immigrant communities in israel and new yorkphonology{edit]main article: persian phonologyiranian persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonantsvowels{edit]the vowel phonemes of modern tehran persianhistorically persian has distinguished length early new persian had a series of five long vowels (ixcbx90 uxcbx90 xc9x92xcbx90 oxcbx90 and excbx90) along with three short vowels xc3xa6 i and u at some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern iran excbx90 and ixcbx90 merged into ixcbx90 and oxcbx90 and uxcbx90 merged into uxcbx90 thus older contrasts such as xd8xb4xdbx8cxd8xb1xe2x80x8e shxc4x93r "lion" vs xd8xb4xdbx8cxd8xb1xe2x80x8e shxc4xabr "milk" and xd8xb2xd9x88xd8xafxe2x80x8e zxc5xabd "quick" vs xd8xb2xd9x88xd8xb1xe2x80x8e zxc5x8dr "strong" were lost however there are exceptions to this rule and in some words xc4x93 and xc5x8d are preserved{citation needed] or merged into the diphthongs {exc9xaa] and {oxcax8a] (which are descendants of the diphthongs {xc3xa6xc9xaa] and {xc3xa6xcax8a] in early new persian) instead of merging into ixcbx90 and uxcbx90 examples of the exception can be found in words such as xd8xb1xd9x88xd8xb4xd9x86xe2x80x8e {roxcax8axcax83xc3xa6n] (bright)however in dari the archaic distinction of excbx90 and ixcbx90 (respectively known as xdbx8cxd8xa7xdbx8c xd9x85xd8xacxd9x87xd9x88xd9x84xe2x80x8e yxc4x81-ye majhxc5xabl and xdbx8cxd8xa7xdbx8c xd9x85xd8xb9xd8xb1xd9x88xd9x81xe2x80x8e yxc4x81-ye ma'rxc5xabf) is still preserved as well as the distinction of oxcbx90 and uxcbx90 (known as xd9x88xd8xa7xd9x88 xd9x85xd8xacxd9x87xd9x88xd9x84xe2x80x8e wxc4x81w-e majhxc5xabl and xd9x88xd8xa7xd9x88 xd9x85xd8xb9xd8xb1xd9x88xd9x81xe2x80x8e wxc4x81w-e ma'rxc5xabf) on the other hand in standard tajik the length distinction has disappeared and ixcbx90 merged with i and uxcbx90 with u{78] therefore contemporary afghan dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of early new persianaccording to most studies on the subject (eg samareh 1977 pisowicz 1985 najafi 2001) the three vowels traditionally considered long (i u xc9x92) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts (e o xc3xa6) by position of articulation rather than by length however there are studies (eg hayes 1979 windfuhr 1979) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system with xc9x92 i and u phonologically long or bimoraic and xc3xa6 e and o phonologically short or monomoraicthere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system (such as toosarvandani 2004) that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active featurethe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including tajik)consonants{edit]labialalveolarpostalveolarpalatalvelaruvularglottalnasalmnxc5x8bplosivep bt dk xc9xa1q

formation{edit]persian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes stems nouns and adjectives persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns adjectives and verbal stems new words are extensively formed by compoundingxc2xa0xe2x80x93 two existing words combining into a new one as is common in germaninfluences{edit]see also: list of english words of persian origin list of french loanwords in persian and iranian languages xc2xa7xc2xa0comparison table of the iranian languageswhile having a lesser influence on arabic{19] and other languages of mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of middle persian origin{13] new persian contains a considerable amount of arabic lexical items{10]{18]{20] which were persianized{21] and often took a different meaning and usage than the arabic original persian loanwords of arabic origin especially include islamic terms the arabic vocabulary in other iranian turkic and indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from new persian not from arabic itself{81]john r perry in his article lexical areas and semantic fields of arabic estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20000 words in current persian and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern persian literature are of arabic origin the text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area it may approach 25 percent of a text in literature{82] among the arabic loan words relatively few (14 percent) are from the semantic domain of material culture while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life{83] most of the arabic words used in persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in persian{84]the inclusion of mongolian and turkic elements in the persian language should also be mentioned{85] not only because of the political role a succession of turkic dynasties played in iranian history but also because of the immense prestige persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider (non-arab) islamic world which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a turkic background the turkish and mongolian vocabulary in persian is minor in comparison to that of arabic and these words were mainly confined to military pastoral terms and political sector (titles administration etc){86] new military and political titles were coined based partially on middle persian (eg xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xaaxd8xb4xe2x80x8e artexc5xa1 for "army" instead of the uzbek xd9x82xd8xa4xd8xb4xdbx8cxd9x86xe2x80x8e qoxcaxbbshin; xd8xb3xd8xb1xd9x84xd8xb4xdaxa9xd8xb1xe2x80x8e sarlaxc5xa1kar; xd8xafxd8xb1xdbx8cxd8xa7xd8xa8xd8xa7xd9x86xe2x80x8e daryxc4x81bxc4x81n; etc) in the 20th century persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages especially other indo-european languages such as armenian{87] urdu and (to a lesser extent) hindi; the latter two through conquests of persianized central asian turkic and afghan invaders;{88] turkic languages such as ottoman turkish chagatai tatar turkish{89] turkmen azeri{90] uzbek and karachay-balkar;{91]

typically written in a modified version of the cyrillic script there also exist several romanization systems for persian after the muslim conquest of persia it took approximately 150 years before persians adopted the arabic script in place of the older alphabet previously two different scripts were used pahlavi used for middle persian and the avestan alphabet (in persian dxc4xabndapirak or din dabirexe2x80x94literally: religion script) used for religious purposes primarily for the avestan but sometimes for middle persianin the modern persian script historically short vowels are usually not written only the historically long ones are represented in the text so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: western persian kerm "worm" karam "generosity" kerem "cream" and krom "chrome" are all spelled krm (xdaxa9xd8xb1xd9x85xe2x80x8e) in persian the reader must determine the word from context the arabic system of vocalization marks known as harakat is also used in persian although some of the symbols have different pronunciations for example a xe1xb8x8dammah is pronounced {xcax8au] while in iranian persian it is pronounced {o] this system is not used in mainstream persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionariesthere are several letters generally only used in arabic loanwords these letters are pronounced the same as similar persian letters for example there are four functionally identical letters for z (xd8xb2 xd8xb0 xd8xb6 xd8xb8xe2x80x8e) three letters for s (xd8xb3 xd8xb5

considerable to such an extent that vast regions adapted their language this process was all the more remarkable since in spite of their almost uninterrupted political domination for nearly 1500 years the cultural influence of these rough nomads on iran's refined civilization remained extremely tenuous this is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made (doerfer) the number of turkish or mongol words that entered persian though not negligible remained limited to 2135 ie 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most these new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector (titles administration etc) and on the other hand to technical pastoral terms the contrast with arab influence is striking while cultural pressure of the arabs on iran had been intense they in no way infringed upon the entire iranian territory whereas with the turks whose contributions to iranian civilization were modest vast regions of iranian lands were assimilated notwithstanding the fact that resistance by the latter was ultimately victorious several reasons may be offered"^ "armenia and iran iv iranian influences in
