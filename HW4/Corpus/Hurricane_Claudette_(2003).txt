tropical storm and first hurricane of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season a fairly long-lived july atlantic hurricane claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern caribbean it moved quickly westward brushing past the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula before moving northwestward through the gulf of mexico claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in port o'connor texas when it quickly strengthened to a strong categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its pathclaudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in july in the united states since hurricane danny in the 1997 season the hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in texas mostly from strong winds as well as extensive beach erosion because of the damage president george w bush declared portions of south texas a federal disaster area allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the mexican state of quintana roo as a tropical storm as well as minor damage on saint lucia before developing into a tropical cyclonecontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 caribbean sea32 texas4 aftermath5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on july 1 it steadily organized as it moved westward and resembled a tropical depression by july 7 however surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics and remained simply a low-pressure system the wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the lesser antilles on july 8 but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern caribbean because it had tropical storm-force winds the system was upgraded immediately to tropical storm claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on july 8{1]by early on july 9 while south of puerto rico claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the caribbean and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity possibly due to its fast forward motion the storm became disorganized and weakened conditions briefly became more favorable over the western caribbean and claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on july 10 soon after the storm encountered unfavorable upper-level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm in response to a break in the subtropical ridgexe2x80x94a high-pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northwardxe2x80x94it turned to the west-northwest claudette made its first landfall at puerto morelos on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on july 11 as a tropical storm with 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) winds{1]hurricane claudette making landfall at texas on july 15claudette wobbled to the northwest over the gulf of mexico and gradually restrengthened upper-level winds steadily decreased and claudette again became a hurricane late on july 14 just prior to landfall it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction striking port o'connor texas on july 15 as a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) winds residents along and inland of the central texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival the hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of july 15 but instead came ashore before noon{2] furthermore some initial estimates suggested that claudette had reached categoryxc2xa02 status with sustained winds of up to 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data{1]as slow as claudette was to strengthen it was also slow to dissipate over land inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to 83xc2xa0mph (134xc2xa0kmh) at victoria regional airport{2] it maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24xc2xa0hours after landfall a rarity for such a weak storm; most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall as they are separated from the warm waters that power them the storm finally lost its low-level circulation early on july 17 over chihuahua although its rainfall and upper-level circulation continued into the pacific ocean{1]preparations{edit]mexican officials issued a tropical storm warning 37xc2xa0hours prior to the storm's landfall between chetumal and cabo catoche quintana roo the warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall but was downgraded when claudette weakened just 13xc2xa0hours prior to its landfall in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{1] the mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm and declared an evacuation order for 1500 citizens in quintana roo there residents remained calm during the evacuation{3] tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on among other items beer which was banned at midnight schools were set up as shelters while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels{4]the consistent variation in the path of claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall on july 13 two days prior to claudette's eventual landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch between brownsville and port o'connor texas by the next day a hurricane warning existed from baffin bay to high island texas while a tropical storm warning extended from high island to intracoastal city louisiana when it became apparent that louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled{1] in texas galveston county officials recommended evacuations for western galveston island and jamaica beach 24xc2xa0hours prior to claudette's projected landfall the emergency phone notification system notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion some of whom remembered the flooding from tropical storm frances five years before{5]hurricane claudette also affected the oil industry exxonmobil chevron conocophillips shell oil marathon oil unocal corporation and anadarko petroleum corporation all limited production and evacuated many of their workers chevron which evacuated more than 1800xc2xa0workers returned many of its workers on the day when claudette made landfall unocal closed 23xc2xa0rigs and platforms in the region the combined closures stopped the daily production of 225000 barrels (35800xc2xa0m3) per day of oil and 2xc2xa0billion cubic feet (57000000xc2xa0m3) of natural gas which accounted for 15 of the total production in the gulf of mexico{6]impact{edit]rainfall totals from claudetteoutside of texas hurricane claudette caused little damage due to its low intensity in total damage estimates rose to 180xc2xa0million (2003 usd 198xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) and the storm caused one direct and two indirect deaths one of the indirect deaths occurred from a man having a heart attack while surfing in the eastern gulf of mexico{1]caribbean sea{edit]tropical storm claudette hitting the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on july 11as a tropical wave claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds to the island of saint lucia the george f l charles airport in castries reported a wind gust of 52xc2xa0mph (84xc2xa0kmh) while other parts of the island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts on the northern and eastern portions of the island the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways{7] overall damage was light and amounted to 11xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 143xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){8]in the dominican republic the outer bands of the storm caused moderate rainfall of up to 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) in santo domingo winds gusted up to 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) knocking down trees sign posts and iron roofs also flooding in metropolitan areas blocked traffic for cars and pedestrians banana and other fruit plantations in the southwestern portion of the country experienced severe damage although exact damage totals are unknown{9]on jamaica the storm caused wind gusts of 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) in montego bay{1] forecasters predicted high tides strong waves and up to 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rain on the island although exact post-storm totals are not known{10] many fishermen moved their boats from the water to safety while a cruise line diverted three ships away from claudette's path{11]in the cayman islands where the storm remained 165 miles (266xc2xa0km) away at its closest point rainfall totals ranged from 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76xc2xa0mm){1] on the south side of grand cayman claudette caused wave heights of around 10 feet (30xc2xa0m) while the western side received little precipitation also on grand cayman the storm caused winds of 35xe2x80x9340xc2xa0mph (56xe2x80x9364xc2xa0kmh) causing minor tree damage but little else{12]on mexico's yucatxc3xa1n peninsula claudette lashed strong waves against the coastline at cancxc3xban but overall caused light damage{13] while crossing the peninsula the storm dropped moderate rainfall including a total of 322 inches (82xc2xa0mm) in cancxc3xban{1] winds were moderate causing the cancxc3xban international airport to delay several flights though there were no cancellations overall claudette sank a few small boats and flooded a few streets in cancxc3xban though damage was minor in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{13]texas{edit]overview of damage in palaciosupon making landfall on the central texas coast claudette's storm surge reached a maximum height of 53 feet (16xc2xa0m) in galveston freeport reported a "storm tide"xe2x80x94the overall rise of water over the mean low tidexe2x80x94of 915 feet (279xc2xa0m) claudette produced moderate rainfall across southern texas peaking at 65 inches (170xc2xa0mm) in tilden on matagorda island the local weather station measured winds of 75xc2xa0mph (121xc2xa0kmh)xe2x80x94the only official report of hurricane-force winds along the coastline however several offshore oil rigs reported winds of up to 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) and one unofficial reading in seadrift indicated winds of 966xc2xa0mph (1555xc2xa0kmh) this report would suggest the storm was a low-end category 2 hurricane though this contradicted hurricane hunters' data which pointed to a storm of a lesser intensity{1]severe beach erosion occurred from high island to freeport though large geo-tubes reduced the erosion on galveston island and the bolivar peninsula{14] the outer bands of the hurricane spawned two tornadoes one was an f1 on the fujita scale that caused damage to several buildings in palacios and the other damaged homes in port lavaca{1]widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast texas coastline most of which occurred in matagorda county in addition the winds damaged 1407 homes with 144 of them being severely damaged the wind also affected 147 businesses of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged{14] strong winds downed numerous power lines leaving around 74000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath{15] overall claudette caused 180xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 234xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in damage in texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm also the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell on a person in the aftermath of the storm{1]aftermath{edit]beach erosion caused by claudetteon july 17 president george w bush declared 18 south texas counties as a federal disaster area within 2xc2xa0months of the storm over 15000xc2xa0citizens registered for assistance{16] the government approved 348xc2xa0million (2003 usd 453xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in aid of which nearly half went to basic house repairs the federal emergency management agency (fema) provided 75 of the 135xc2xa0million (2003 usd 176xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) debris removal cost with the other 25 being covered through local agencies{17] fema also provided 126xc2xa0million (2003 usd 164xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) to repair geo-tubes on the bolivar peninsula in galveston county the geo-tubes which protect buildings along coastal areas were severely damaged by the hurricane{18]in western texas heavy rainfall of up to 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm) temporarily sparked widespread growth of wildflowers in a normally arid landscape the rainfall restored the flow of the rio grande at big bend national park which had ceased in the area due to lack of rainfall in addition the precipitation increased the water level in the amistad reservoir by more than 4 feet (12xc2xa0m){19]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms of the same
