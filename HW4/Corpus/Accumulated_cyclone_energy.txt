b'accumulated cyclone energy - wikipedia accumulated cyclone energyfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchaccumulated cyclone energy (ace) is a measure used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons particularly the north atlantic hurricane season it uses an approximation of the wind energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated every six hours the ace of a season is the sum of the aces for each storm and takes into account the number strength and duration of all the tropical storms in the season the highest ace calculated for a single storm is 82 for hurricanetyphoon ioke in 2006{1]contents1 calculation2 competing

linkscalculation{edit]the ace of a season is calculated by summing the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots {65 kmh 40 mph] or higher) at six-hour intervals since the calculation is sensitive to the starting point of the six-hour intervals the convention is to use 00:00 06:00 12:00 and 18:00 utc if any storms of a season happen to cross years the storm's ace counts for the previous year{2] the numbers are usually divided by 10000 to make them more manageable one unit of ace equals 104xc2xa0kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed thus:ace=10xe2x88x924xe2x88x91vmax2{displaystyle {ext{ace}}=10^{-4}sum v_{max }^{2}}where vmax is estimated sustained wind speed in knotskinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity and by adding together the energy per some interval of time the accumulated energy is found as the duration of a storm increases more values are summed and the ace also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ace than more-powerful storms of lesser duration although ace is a value proportional to the energy of the system it is not a direct calculation of energy (the mass of the moved air and therefore the size of the storm would show up in a real energy calculation)a related quantity is hurricane destruction potential (hdp) which is ace but only calculated for the time where the system is a hurricane{3]competing measurement metrics{edit]ace focuses upon the most intense winds concentrated in a storm's center whereas the actual destructive power of a storm depends upon the total area impacted with damaging winds waves and storm surge the metric integrated kinetic energy (ike) developed in 2007 more accurately reflects the destructive potential it examines the kinetic energy that forces a storm surge and creates high waves as well as the horizontal wind loads over the full storm this metric yields a time specific value for a storm and doesn't account for the destruction caused by a storm over its entire life therefore in 2013 the researchers at the university of florida created a metric called track integrated kinetic energy (tike) tike expands the concept by accumulating ike over the lifespan of an individual tropical cyclone and a total value for all named tropical cyclones in the season {4]atlantic basin ace{edit]501001502002503001950196019701980199020002010categories{edit]atlantic basin cyclone intensity by accumulated cyclone energy timeseries 1850-2014a season's ace is used by noaa and others to categorize the hurricane season into 3 groups by its activity{5] measured over the period 1951xe2x80x932000 for the atlantic basin the median annual index was 875 and the mean annual index was 932 the noaa categorization system divides seasons into:above-normal season: an ace value above 111 (120 of the 1981xe2x80x932010 median) provided at least two of the following three parameters are also exceeded: number of tropical storms: 12 hurricanes: 6 and major hurricanes: 2near-normal season: neither above-normal nor below normalbelow-normal season: an ace value below 66 (714 of the 1981xe2x80x932010 median) or none of the following three parameters are exceeded: number of tropical storms: 9 hurricanes: 4 and major hurricanes: 1according to the noaa categorization system for the atlantic the most recent above-normal season is the 2017 season the most recent near-normal season is the 2014 season and the most recent below normal season is the 2015 seasonhyperactivity{edit]the term hyperactive is used by goldenberg et al (2001){6] based on a different weighting algorithm{7] (reference link is brokenneed new citatation) which places more weight on major hurricanes but typically equating to an ace of about 153 (175 of the 1951xe2x80x932000 median) or moreindividual storms{edit]the highest ever ace estimated for a single storm in the atlantic is 736 for the san ciriaco hurricane in 1899 this single storm had an ace higher than many whole atlantic storm seasons other atlantic storms with high aces include hurricane ivan in 2004 with an ace of 704 hurricane irma in 2017 with an ace of 666 the great charleston hurricane of 1893 with an ace of 635 hurricane isabel in 2003 with an ace of 633 and the 1932 cuba hurricane with an ace of 598{8]the highest ace of a tropical storm was tropical storm alice of 1953 which attained an ace of 96 the highest ace of a category 1xc2xa0hurricane was hurricane nadine of 2012 which attained an ace of 263 the lowest ace of a tropical storm was tropical storm chris of 2000 which was a tropical storm for only six hours and had an ace of 01 the lowest ace of any hurricane was the escuminac hurricane of 1959 which was only active for one day and had an ace of just 12 the lowest ace of a major hurricane (categoryxc2xa03 or higher) was 1960's hurricane ethel and 1969's hurricane gerda each with an ace of 53{9] the only years since 1950 to feature two storms with an ace index of over 40 points have been 1966 2003 and 2004 and the only year to feature three storms is 2017{citation needed]the following table shows
