anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on august 30;{1] this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967{2] initially it threatened to strike texas though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned anita to the west-southwest the hurricane developed a well-defined eye and hurricane anita began to rapidly intensify late on september 1 after attaining major hurricane status during a two-day period up to its peak intensity anita deepened at a rate of 2xc2xa0mbar per hour and on september 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) while located just offshore northeastern mexico making anita a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{1]hurricane anita maintained its strength as it approached land and at 1100xc2xa0utc on september 2 it made landfall on soto la marina tamaulipas about 145xc2xa0miles (235xc2xa0km) south of brownsville texas or 80xc2xa0miles (130xc2xa0km) north of tampico mexico moving ashore with a pressure of 926xc2xa0mbar anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the gulf of mexico{2]{3] it rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of mexico and on september 3 about 25xc2xa0hours after moving ashore anita emerged into the eastern pacific ocean as a tropical depression reclassified as tropical depression eleven the system continued to the west and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures the depression gradually lost its deep convection and on september 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula{4]preparations{edit]hurricane anita near its mexico landfallshortly after first developing one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of texas and louisiana by helicopter with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers{5] ultimately 7000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms{1] the threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern louisiana the national hurricane center advised small craft along the northern gulf coast to remain at port{5] initially anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the texaslouisiana border as a result schools in cameron parish louisiana were closed{6] and on august 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern louisiana and northeastern texas coastlines after the track shifted further to the south the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between brownsville and just south of corpus christi texas{1] an emergency shelter was opened in brownwood texas and army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations{7] an official from the national weather service recommended evacuation for all residents east of galveston texas living in an area below 5xc2xa0feet (15xc2xa0m) above sea level; about 20000 left cameron louisiana{8] in all about 58000xc2xa0people evacuated coastal locations in louisiana and texas{1]though the national hurricane center did not issue hurricane warnings for mexico officials warned the mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane across the northeastern coastline of the country 35000xc2xa0people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane{1] including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck{9] the mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters{10]impact{edit]rainfall summary for hurricane anitaunited states{edit]as the precursor tropical disturbance crossed southern florida it dropped light rainfall of over 1xc2xa0inch (25xc2xa0mm) in the miami area{11] later as a developing tropical depression the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern louisiana;{5] one station near galliano reported over 3xc2xa0inches (76xc2xa0mm) of precipitation{11] hurricane anita produced a storm tide of 2xc2xa0feet (06xc2xa0m) above normal in grand isle which resulted in hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes{8]the hurricane produced above-normal tides along the texas coastline which closed several highways including texas state highway 87{8] the northern periphery of hurricane anita produced light to moderate rainfall across the southern portion of the state which peaked at 497xc2xa0inches (126xc2xa0mm) at rio grande city{11] damage in the state was minor; on south padre island damage was limited to a few broken windows{12]mexico{edit]hurricane anita near landfallhurricane anita made landfall in a sparsely populated portion of mexico; as a result few meteorological statistics exist a station near where the hurricane moved ashore recorded 1752xc2xa0inches (445xc2xa0mm) of precipitation in six hours which resulted in severe flooding and mudslides{1] winds along the eastern mexico coastline were estimated at over 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh){13]the hurricane caused extensive damage to fishing and farming communities in northeastern mexico{1] strong winds destroyed thousands of homes and left about 25000 people homeless according to newspaper reports from mexico city the winds destroyed the roofs of most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore{14] and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region{15] with some flooded avenues in tampico and reports of flooded highways near ciudad victoria{13] eleven people were killed in floods and mudslides across tamaulipas{16] in all at least 50000 people were affected by the hurricane in mexico{17]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesthe name anita was retired following this storm and will never be used for an atlantic hurricane again shortly after the hurricane made landfall the government of mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact{13] additionally officials permitted full use of the mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid{10] three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm{16] in texas the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into low-lying marshland led to a mosquito outbreak near galveston following the storm{18]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneslist of atlantic hurricaneslist of atlanticxe2x80x93pacific crossover hurricanesreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i lawrence miles b (april 1 1978) "atlantic hurricane season of 1977" monthly weather review american meteorological society 106 (4): 534xe2x80x93545 bibcode:1978mwrv106534l doi:1011751520-0493(1978)106<0534:ahso>20co;2 archived (pdf) from the original on april 10 2002 retrieved february 24 2013xc2xa0^ a b "atlantic hurricane best track (hurdat version 2)" hurricane research division (database) miami fl: national hurricane center april 11 2017 retrieved november 10 2017xc2xa0^ national hurricane center;
