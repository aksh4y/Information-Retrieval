the earlier symbol b is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of b denoting the unit barn but it is still encountered especially as mb (rather than the proper mbar) to denote the millibar between 1793 and 1795 the word bar was used for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric system{6]usage{edit]atmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 101325 mbar 101325xc2xa0kpa 101325xc2xa0bar which is about 147 pounds per square inch despite the millibar not being an si unit meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient after the advent of si units some meteorologists began using hectopascals (symbol hpa) which are numerically equivalent to millibars; for the same reason the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries for example the weather office of environment canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps{7]{8] in contrast americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in us reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic storms{citation needed]in fresh water there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in metres specifically an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1019716xc2xa0m increase in depth in sea water with respect to the gravity variation the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into meters depth according to an empirical formula (unesco tech paper 44 pxc2xa025){9] as a result decibars are commonly used in oceanographymany engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbersengineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studiesa tire pressure gauge displaying bar (outside) and pounds per square inch (inside)in the automotive field turbocharger boost is often described in bars outside the usa tire pressure is often specified in barunicode has characters for "mb" (xe3x8fx94 u+33d4) and "bar" (xe3x8dxb4 u+3374) but they exist only for compatibility with legacy asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documentsthe kilobar equivalent to 100xc2xa0mpa is commonly used in geological systems particularly in experimental petrology"bar(a)" and "bara" are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures and "bar(g)" and "barg" for gauge pressures this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as "gauge pressure of 2 bar" or "2 bar gauge" are recommended{2]{10]see also{edit]centimetre of waterconversion of unitsmetric prefixorders of magnitude (pressure)references{edit]this article incorporates material from the citizendium article "bar (unit)" which is licensed under the creative commons attribution-sharealike 30 unported license but not under the gfdl^ a b international bureau of weights and measures (2006) the international system of units (si) (pdf) (8th ed) pxc2xa0127 isbnxc2xa092-822-2213-6 archived (pdf) from the original on 2017-08-14xc2xa0^ a b c d british standard bs 350:2004 conversion factors for units^ nomenclature of the unit of absolut pressure charles f marvin 1918^ nist special publication 1038 sec 432;
