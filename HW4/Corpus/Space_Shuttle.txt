low earth orbital spacecraft system operated by the us national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) as part of the space shuttle program its official program name was space transportation system (sts) taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development{10] the first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 five complete shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 launched from the kennedy space center (ksc) in florida operational missions launched numerous satellites interplanetary probes and the hubble space telescope (hst); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the international space station the shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days 19 hours 21 minutes and 23 seconds{11]shuttle components included the orbiter vehicle (ov) a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters (srbs) and the expendable external tank (et) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen the shuttle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket with the two srbs operating in parallel with the ov's three main engines which were fueled from the et the srbs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit and the et was jettisoned just before orbit insertion which used the orbiter's two orbital maneuvering system (oms) engines at the conclusion of the mission the orbiter fired its oms to de-orbit and re-enter the atmosphere the orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing usually to the shuttle landing facility at kennedy space center florida or rogers dry lake in edwards air force base california after landing at edwards the orbiter was flown back to the ksc on the shuttle carrier aircraft a specially modified version of the boeing 747the first orbiter enterprise was built in 1976 used in approach and landing tests and had no orbital capability four fully operational orbiters were initially built: columbia challenger discovery and atlantis of these two were lost in mission accidents: challenger in 1986 and columbia in 2003 with a total of fourteen astronauts killed a fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter endeavour was built in 1991 to replace challenger the space shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of

non-nasaoverview{edit]the space shuttle was a partially reusable{12] human spaceflight vehicle capable of reaching low earth orbit commissioned and operated by the us national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) from 1981 to 2011 it resulted from shuttle design studies conducted by nasa and the us air force in the 1960s and was first proposed for development as part of an ambitious second-generation space transportation system (sts) of space vehicles to follow the apollo program in a september 1969 report of a space task group headed by vice president spiro agnew to president richard nixon nixon's post-apollo nasa budgeting withdrew support of all system components except the shuttle to which nasa applied the sts name{10]the vehicle consisted of a spaceplane for orbit and re-entry fueled by expendable liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks with reusable strap-on solid booster rockets the first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 all launched from the kennedy space center florida the system was retired from service in 2011 after 135 missions{13] with atlantis making the final launch of the three-decade shuttle program on july 8 2011{14] the program ended after atlantis landed at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 major missions included launching numerous satellites and interplanetary probes{15] conducting space science experiments and servicing and construction of space stations the first orbiter vehicle named enterprise was built for the initial approach and landing tests phase and lacked engines heat shielding and other equipment necessary for orbital flight{16] a total of five operational orbiters were built and of these two were destroyed in accidentsit was used for orbital space missions by nasa the us department of defense the european space agency japan and germany{17]{18] the united states funded shuttle development and operations except for the spacelab modules used on d1 and d2xe2x80x94sponsored by germany{17]{19]{20]{21]{22] sl-j was partially funded by japan{18]sts-129 ready for launchshuttle approach and landing test crews 1976early concept for a space shuttle refueling a space tug 1970at launch it consisted of the "stack" including the dark orange external tank (et) (for the first two launches the tank was painted white);{23]{24] two white slender solid rocket boosters (srbs); and the orbiter vehicle which contained the crew and payload some payloads were launched into higher orbits with either of two different upper stages developed for the sts (single-stage payload assist module or two-stage inertial upper stage) the space shuttle was stacked in the vehicle assembly building and the stack mounted on a mobile launch platform held down by four frangible nuts{25] on each srb which were detonated at launch{26]the shuttle stack launched vertically like a conventional rocket it lifted off under the power of its two srbs and three main engines which were fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the et the space shuttle had a two-stage ascent the srbs provided additional thrust during liftoff and first-stage flight about two minutes after liftoff frangible nuts were fired releasing the srbs which then parachuted into the ocean to be retrieved by nasa recovery ships for refurbishment and reuse the orbiter and et continued to ascend on an increasingly horizontal flight path under power from its main engines upon reaching 17500xc2xa0mph (78xc2xa0kms) necessary for low earth orbit the main engines were shut down the et attached by two frangible nuts{27] was then jettisoned to burn up in the atmosphere{28] after jettisoning the external tank the orbital maneuvering system (oms) engines were used to adjust the orbit the orbiter carried astronauts and payloads such as satellites or space station parts into low earth orbit the earth's upper atmosphere or thermosphere{29] usually five to seven crew members rode in the orbiter two crew members the commander and pilot were sufficient for a minimal flight as in the first four "test" flights sts-1 through sts-4 the typical payload capacity was about 50045 pounds (22700xc2xa0kg) but could be increased depending on the choice of launch configuration the orbiter carried its payload in a large cargo bay with doors that opened along the length of its top a feature which made the space shuttle unique among spacecraft this feature made possible the deployment of large satellites such as the hubble space telescope and also the capture and return of large payloads back to earthwhen the orbiter's space mission was complete it fired its oms thrusters to drop out of orbit and re-enter the lower atmosphere{29] during descent the orbiter passed through different layers of the atmosphere and decelerated from hypersonic speed primarily by aerobraking in the lower atmosphere and landing phase it was more like a glider but with reaction control system (rcs) thrusters and fly-by-wire-controlled hydraulically actuated flight surfaces controlling its descent it landed on a long runway as a conventional aircraft the aerodynamic shape was a compromise between the demands of radically different speeds and air pressures during re-entry hypersonic flight and subsonic atmospheric flight as a result the orbiter had a relatively high sink rate at low altitudes and it transitioned during re-entry from using rcs thrusters at very high altitudes to flight surfaces in the lower atmosphereearly history{edit]further information: space shuttle program and space shuttle design processpresident nixon (right) with nasa administrator fletcher in january 1972 three months before congress approved funding for the shuttle programvision for a spacelab mission with various equipment in the shuttle bayvision for space station freedom with an sts orbiter dockedthe formal design of what became the space shuttle began with the "phase a" contract design studies issued in the late 1960s conceptualization had begun two decades earlier before the apollo program of the 1960s one of the places the concept of a spacecraft returning from space to a horizontal landing originated was within naca in 1954 in the form of an aeronautics research experiment later named the x-15 the naca proposal was submitted by walter dornbergerin 1958 the x-15 concept further developed into proposal to launch an x-15 into space and another x-series spaceplane proposal named x-20 dyna-soar as well as variety of aerospace plane concepts and studies neil armstrong was selected to pilot both the x-15 and the x-20 though the x-20 was not built another spaceplane similar to the x-20 was built several years later and delivered to nasa in january 1966 called the hl-10 ("hl" indicated "horizontal landing")in the mid-1960s the us air force conducted classified studies on next-generation space transportation systems and concluded that semi-reusable designs were the cheapest choice it proposed a development program with an immediate start on a "classxc2xa0i" vehicle with expendable boosters followed by slower development of a "classxc2xa0ii" semi-reusable design and possible "classxc2xa0iii" fully reusable design later in 1967 george mueller held a one-day symposium at nasa headquarters to study the options eighty people attended and presented a wide variety of designs including earlier us air force designs such as the x-20 dyna-soarin 1968 nasa officially began work on what was then known as the integrated launch and re-entry vehicle (ilrv) at the same time nasa held a separate space shuttle main engine (ssme) competition nasa offices in houston and huntsville jointly issued a request for proposal (rfp) for ilrv studies to design a spacecraft that could deliver a payload to orbit but also re-enter the atmosphere and fly back to earth for example one of the responses was for a two-stage design featuring a large booster and a small orbiter called the dc-3 one of several phase a shuttle designs after the aforementioned "phase a" studies b c and d phases progressively evaluated in-depth designs up to 1972 in the final design the bottom stage consisted of recoverable solid rocket boosters and the top stage used an expendable external tank{30]in 1969 president richard nixon decided to support proceeding with space shuttle development a series of development programs and analysis refined the basic design prior to full development and testing in august 1973 the x-24b proved that an unpowered spaceplane could re-enter earth's atmosphere for a horizontal landingacross the atlantic european ministers met in belgium in 1973 to authorize western europe's manned orbital project and its main contribution to space shuttlexe2x80x94the spacelab program{31] spacelab would provide a multidisciplinary orbital space laboratory and additional space equipment for the shuttle{31]description{edit]sts-1 on the launch pad december 1980the space shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for reuse it carried different payloads to low earth orbit provided crew rotation and supplies for the international space station (iss) and performed satellite servicing and repair the orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to earth each shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life although this was later extended the person in charge of designing the sts was maxime faget who had also overseen the mercury gemini and apollo spacecraft designs the crucial factor in the size and shape of the shuttle orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites and have over 1000 mile cross-range recovery range to meet the requirement for classified usaf missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a polar orbit the militarily specified 1085xc2xa0nmi (2009xc2xa0km; 1249xc2xa0mi) cross range requirement was one of the primary reasons for the shuttle's large wings compared to modern commercial designs with very minimal control surfaces and glide capability factors involved in opting for solid rockets and an expendable fuel tank included the desire of the pentagon to obtain a high-capacity payload vehicle for satellite deployment and the desire of the nixon administration to reduce the costs of space exploration by developing a spacecraft with reusable componentseach space shuttle was a reusable launch system composed of three main assemblies: the reusable ov the expendable et and the two reusable srbs{32] only the ov entered orbit shortly after the tank and boosters are jettisoned the vehicle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket and the orbiter glided to a horizontal landing like an airplane after which it was refurbished for reuse the srbs parachuted to splashdown in the ocean where they were towed back to shore and refurbished for later shuttle missionsdiscovery rockets into orbit seen here just after solid rocket booster (srb) separationtail-end of an orbiter showing various nozzles during an orbital maneuver with issfive operational ovs were built: columbia (ov-102) challenger (ov-099) discovery (ov-103) atlantis (ov-104) and endeavour (ov-105) a mock-up inspiration currently stands at the entrance to the astronaut hall of fame an additional craft enterprise (ov-101) was built for atmospheric testing gliding and landing; it was originally intended to be outfitted for orbital operations after the test program but it was found more economical to upgrade the structural test article sta-099 into orbiter challenger (ov-099) challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launch in 1986 and endeavour was built as a replacement from structural spare components building endeavour cost about us17xc2xa0billion columbia broke apart over texas during re-entry in 2003 a space shuttle launch cost around 450xc2xa0million{33]roger a pielke jr has estimated that the space shuttle program cost about us170xc2xa0billion (2008 dollars) through early 2008; the average cost per flight was about us15xc2xa0billion{34] two missions were paid for by germany spacelab d1 and d2 (d for deutschland) with a payload control center in oberpfaffenhofen{35]{36] d1 was the first time that control of a manned sts mission payload was not in us hands{17]at times the orbiter itself was referred to as the space shuttle this was not technically correct as the space shuttle was the combination of the orbiter the external tank and the two solid rocket boosters these components once assembled in the vehicle assembly building originally built to assemble the apollo saturn v rocket were commonly referred to as the "stack"{37]responsibility for the shuttle components was spread among multiple nasa field centers the kennedy space center was responsible for launch landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program) the us air force at the vandenberg air force base was responsible for launch landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used) the johnson space center served as the central point for all shuttle operations the marshall space flight center was responsible for the main engines external tank and solid rocket boosters the john c stennis space center handled main engine testing and the goddard space flight center managed the global tracking network{38]orbiter vehicle{edit]main article: space shuttle orbitershuttle launch profiles from left to right: columbia challenger discovery atlantis and endeavourthe orbiter resembled a conventional aircraft with double-delta wings swept 81xc2xb0 at the inner leading edge and 45xc2xb0 at the outer leading edge its vertical stabilizer's leading edge was swept back at a 50xc2xb0 angle the four elevons mounted at the trailing edge of the wings and the rudderspeed brake attached at the trailing edge of the stabilizer with the body flap controlled the orbiter during descent and landingthe orbiter's 60-foot (18xc2xa0m)-long payload bay comprising most of the fuselage could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to 15 feet (46xc2xa0m) in diameter information declassified in 2011 showed that these measurements were chosen specifically to accommodate the kh-9 hexagon spy satellite operated by the national reconnaissance office{39] two mostly-symmetrical lengthwise payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay comprised its entire top payloads were generally loaded horizontally into the bay while the orbiter was standing upright on the launch pad and unloaded vertically in the near-weightless orbital environment by the orbiter's robotic remote manipulator arm (under astronaut control) eva astronauts or under the payloads' own power (as for satellites attached to a rocket "upper stage" for deployment)three space shuttle main engines (ssmes) were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern the engine nozzles could gimbal 105 degrees up and down and 85 degrees from side to side during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the shuttle the orbiter structure was made primarily from aluminum alloy although the engine structure was made primarily from titanium alloythe operational orbiters built were ov-102 columbia ov-099 challenger ov-103 discovery ov-104 atlantis and ov-105 endeavour{40]space shuttle atlantis transported by a

tank{edit]main article: space shuttle external tankan external tank floats away from the orbiterinterior of an external tankthe main function of the space shuttle external tank was to supply the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel to the main engines it was also the backbone of the launch vehicle providing attachment points for the two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter the external tank was the only part of the shuttle system that was not reused although the external tanks were always discarded it would have been possible to take them into orbit and re-use them (such as a wet workshop for incorporation into a space station){28]{42]solid rocket boosters{edit]main article: space shuttle solid rocket boostertwo solid rocket boosters (srbs) each provided 12500xc2xa0kn (2800000xc2xa0lbf) of thrust at liftoff{43] which was 83 of the total thrust at liftoff the srbs were jettisoned two minutes after launch at a height of about 46xc2xa0km (150000xc2xa0ft) and then deployed parachutes and landed in the ocean to be recovered{44] the srb cases were made of steel about xc2xbdxc2xa0inch (13xc2xa0mm) thick{45] the solid rocket boosters were re-used many times; the casing used in ares i engine testing in 2009 consisted of motor cases that had been flown collectively on 48 shuttle missions including sts-1{46]astronauts who have flown on multiple spacecraft report that shuttle delivers a rougher ride than apollo or soyuz{47]{48] the additional vibration is caused by the solid rocket boosters as solid fuel does not burn as evenly as liquid fuel the vibration dampens down after the solid rocket boosters have been jettisoned{49]{50]two srb on the crawler prior to mating with the shuttlesrb sections filled with solid propellant being assembledorbiter and the external tank flanked by the two solid rocket boostersorbiter add-ons{edit]the orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-ons depending on the mission this included orbital laboratories (spacelab spacehab) boosters for launching payloads farther into space (inertial upper stage payload assist module) and other functions such as provided by extended duration orbiter multi-purpose logistics modules or canadarm (rms) an upper stage called transfer orbit stage (orbital science corp tos-21) was also used once with the orbiter{51] other types of systems and racks were part of the modular spacelab system xe2x80x94pallets igloo ips etc which also supported special missions such as srtm{52]mplm leonardoius deploying with galileopam-d with satelliteedo being

shuttle program was spacelab primarily contributed by a consortium of european countries and operated in conjunction with the united states and international partners{52] supported by a modular system of pressurized modules pallets and systems spacelab missions executed on multidisciplinary science orbital logistics and international cooperation{52] over 29 missions flew on subjects ranging from astronomy microgravity radar and life sciences to name a few{52] spacelab hardware also supported missions such as hubble (hst) servicing and space station resupply{52] sts-2 and sts-3 provided testing and the first full mission was spacelab-1 (sts-9) launched on november 28 1983{52]spacelab formally began in 1973 after a meeting in brussels belgium by european heads of state{31] within the decade spacelab went into orbit and provided europe and the united states with an orbital workshop and hardware system{31] international cooperation science and exploration were realized on spacelab{52]flight systems{edit]the shuttle was one of the earliest craft to use a computerized fly-by-wire digital flight control system this means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot's control stick to the control surfaces or reaction control system thrusters the control algorithm which used a classical proportional integral derivative (pid) approach was developed and maintained by honeywell{citation needed] the shuttle's fly-by-wire digital flight control system was composed of 4 control systems each addressing a different mission phase: ascent descent on-orbit and aborts{citation needed] honeywell is also credited with the design and implementation of the shuttle's nose wheel steering control algorithm that allowed the orbiter to safely land at kennedy space center's shuttle runway{citation needed]a concern with using digital fly-by-wire systems on the shuttle was reliability considerable research went into the shuttle computer system the shuttle used five identical redundant ibm 32-bit general purpose computers (gpcs) model ap-101 constituting a type of embedded system four computers ran specialized software called the primary avionics software system (pass) a fifth backup computer ran separate software called the backup flight system (bfs) collectively they were called the data processing system (dps){53]{54]simulation of sslv at mach 246 and 66000xc2xa0ft (20000xc2xa0m) the surface of the vehicle is colored by the pressure coefficient and the gray contours represent the density of the surrounding air as calculated using the overflow software packagethe design goal of the shuttle's dps was fail-operationalfail-safe reliability after a single failure the shuttle could still continue the mission after two failures it could still land safelythe four general-purpose computers operated essentially in lockstep checking each other if one computer provided a different result than the other three (ie the one computer failed) the three functioning computers "voted" it out of the system this isolated it from vehicle control if a second computer of the three remaining failed the two functioning computers voted it out a very unlikely failure mode would have been where two of the computers produced result a and two produced result b (a two-two split) in this unlikely case one group of two was to be picked at randomthe backup flight system (bfs) was separately developed software running on the fifth computer used only if the entire four-computer primary system failed the bfs was created because although the four primary computers were hardware redundant they all ran the same software so a generic software problem could crash all of them embedded system avionic software was developed under totally different conditions from public commercial software: the number of code lines was tiny compared to a public commercial software product changes were only made infrequently and with extensive testing and many programming and test personnel worked on the small amount of computer code however in theory it could have still failed and the bfs existed for that contingency while the bfs could run in parallel with pass the bfs never engaged to take over control from pass during any shuttle missionthe software for the shuttle computers was written in a high-level language called hals somewhat similar to pli it is specifically designed for a real time embedded system environmentthe ibm ap-101 computers originally had about 424 kilobytes of magnetic core memory each the cpu could process about 400000 instructions per second they had no hard disk drive and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridgesin 1990 the original computers were replaced with an upgraded model ap-101s which had about 25 times the memory capacity (about 1 megabyte) and three times the processor speed (about 12xc2xa0million instructions per second) the memory was changed from magnetic core to semiconductor with battery backupearly shuttle missions starting in november 1983 took along the grid compass arguably one of the first laptop computers the grid was given the name spoc for shuttle portable onboard computer use on the shuttle required both hardware and software modifications which were incorporated into later versions of the commercial product it was used to monitor and display the shuttle's ground position path of the next two orbits show where the shuttle had line of sight communications with ground stations and determine points for location-specific observations of the earth the compass sold poorly as it cost at least us8000 but it offered unmatched performance for its weight and size{55] nasa was one of its main customers{56]during its service life the shuttle's control system never experienced a failure many of the lessons learned have been used to design today's high speed control algorithms{57]orbiter markings and insignia{edit]payload specialist millie hughes-fulford who flew aboard columbia in 1991 displays the modernist blackburn  danne nasa logotype known as "the worm"the prototype orbiter enterprise originally had a flag of the united states on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters "usa" in black on the right wing the name "enterprise" was painted in black on the payload bay doors just above the hinge and behind the crew module; on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the nasa "worm" logotype in gray underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing is the text "united states" in black with a flag of the united states ahead of itthe first operational orbiter columbia originally had the same markings as enterprise although the letters "usa" on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart columbia also had black markings which enterprise lacked on its forward rcs module around the cockpit windows and on its vertical stabilizer and had distinctive black "chines" on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces which none of the other orbiters hadchallenger established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that was matched by discovery atlantis and endeavour the letters "usa" in black above an american flag were displayed on the left wing with the nasa "worm" logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing the name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows this would make the name visible when the shuttle was photographed in orbit with the doors openin 1983 enterprise had its wing markings changed to match challenger and the nasa "worm" logotype on the aft end of the payload bay doors was changed from gray to black some black markings were added to the nose cockpit windows and vertical tail to more closely resemble the flight vehicles but the name "enterprise" remained on the payload bay doors as there was never any need to open them columbia had its name moved to the forward fuselage to match the other flight vehicles after sts-61-c during the 1986xe2x80x9388 hiatus when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the loss of challenger but retained its original wing markings until its last overhaul (after sts-93) and its unique black wing "chines" for the remainder of its operational lifebeginning in 1998 the flight vehicles' markings were modified to incorporate the nasa "meatball" insignia the "worm" logotype which the agency had phased out was removed from the payload bay doors and the "meatball" insignia was added aft of the "united states" text on the lower aft fuselage the "meatball" insignia was also displayed on the left wing with the american flag above the orbiter's name left-justified rather than centered on the right wing the three surviving flight vehicles discovery atlantis and endeavour still bear these markings as museum displays enterprise became the property of the smithsonian institution in 1985 and was no longer under nasa's control when these changes were made hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doorsupgrades{edit]atlantis was the first shuttle to fly with a glass cockpit on sts-101 (composite image)the space shuttle was initially developed in the 1970s{58] but received many upgrades and modifications afterward to improve performance reliability and safety internally the shuttle remained largely similar to the original design with the exception of the improved avionics computers in addition to the computer upgrades the original analog primary flight instruments were replaced with modern full-color flat-panel display screens called a glass cockpit which is similar to those of contemporary airliners to facilitate construction of iss the internal airlocks of each orbiter except columbia{59] were replaced with external docking systems to allow for a greater amount of cargo to be stored on the shuttle's mid-deck during station resupply missionsthe space shuttle main engines (ssmes) had several improvements to enhance reliability and power this explains phrases such as "main engines throttling up to 104 percent" this did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit the 100 percent figure was the original specified power level during the lengthy development program rocketdyne determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust nasa could have rescaled the output number saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent to clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software so the 104 percent number was retained ssme upgrades were denoted as "block numbers" such as block i block ii and block iia the upgrades improved engine reliability maintainability and performance the 109 thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the block ii engines in 2001 the normal maximum throttle was 104 percent with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission abortsfor the first two missions sts-1 and sts-2 the external tank was painted white to protect the insulation that covers much of the tank but improvements and testing showed that it was not required the weight saved by not painting the tank resulted in an increase in payload capability to orbit{60] additional weight was saved by removing some of the internal "stringers" in the hydrogen tank that proved unnecessary the resulting "light-weight external tank" was first flown on sts-6 {61] and used on the majority of shuttle missions sts-91 saw the first flight of the "super light-weight external tank" this version of the tank was made of the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy it weighed 34

each of these improvements was first flown on operational mission flightsthe solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well design engineers added a third o-ring seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 space shuttle challenger disasterthe three nozzles of the space shuttle main engine with the two orbital maneuvering system (oms) pods and the vertical stabilizer aboveseveral other srb improvements were planned to improve performance and safety but never came to be these culminated in the considerably simpler lower cost probably safer and better-performing advanced solid rocket booster these rockets entered production in the early to mid-1990s to support the space station but were later canceled to save money after the expenditure of 22xc2xa0billion{62] the loss of the asrb program resulted in the development of the super lightweight external tank (slwt) which provided some of the increased payload capability while not providing any of the safety improvements in addition the us air force developed their own much lighter single-piece srb design using a filament-wound system but this too was canceledsts-70 was delayed in 1995 when woodpeckers bored holes in the foam insulation of discovery's external tank since then nasa has installed commercial plastic owl decoys and inflatable owl balloons which had to be removed prior to launch{63] the delicate nature of the foam insulation had been the cause of damage to the thermal protection system the tile heat shield and heat wrap of the orbiter nasa remained confident that this damage while it was the primary cause of the space shuttle columbia disaster on february 1 2003 would not jeopardize the completion of the international space station (iss) in the projected time allotteda cargo-only unmanned variant of the shuttle was variously proposed and rejected since the 1980s it was called the shuttle-c and would have traded re-usability for cargo capability with large potential savings from reusing technology developed for the space shuttle another proposal was to convert the payload bay into a passenger area with versions ranging from 30 to 74 seats three days in orbit and cost us15xc2xa0million per seat{64]on the first four shuttle missions astronauts wore modified us air force high-altitude full-pressure suits which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent from the fifth flight sts-5 until the loss of challenger one-piece light blue nomex flight suits and partial-pressure helmets were worn a less-bulky partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet was reinstated when shuttle flights resumed in 1988 the launch-entry suit ended its service life in late 1995 and was replaced by the full-pressure advanced crew escape suit (aces) which resembled the gemini space suit in design but retained the orange color of the launch-entry suitto extend the duration that orbiters could stay docked at the iss the station-to-shuttle power transfer system (sspts) was installed the sspts allowed these orbiters to use power provided by the iss to preserve their consumables the sspts was first used successfully on

shadow intersects the moon across the skylaunch preparation{edit]see also: space shuttle launch countdown and space shuttle launch commit criteriaall space shuttle missions were launched from kennedy space center (ksc) the weather criteria used for launch included but were not limited to: precipitation temperatures cloud cover lightning forecast wind and humidity{70] the shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by lightning aircraft are often struck by lightning with no adverse effects because the electricity of the strike is dissipated through its conductive structure and the aircraft is not electrically grounded like most jet airliners the shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum which would normally shield and protect the internal systems however upon liftoff the shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground the nasa anvil rule for a shuttle launch stated that an anvil cloud could not appear within a distance of 10 nautical miles{71] the shuttle launch weather officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced in addition the weather conditions had to be acceptable at one of the transatlantic abort landing sites (one of several space shuttle abort modes) to launch as well as the solid rocket booster recovery area{70]{72] while the shuttle might have safely endured a lightning strike a similar strike caused problems on apollo 12 so for safety nasa chose not to launch the shuttle if lightning was possible (npr87155)historically the shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from december to january (a year-end rollover or yero) its flight software designed in the 1970s was not designed for this and would require the orbiter's computers be reset through a change of year which could cause a glitch while in orbit in 2007 nasa engineers devised a solution so shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary{73]launch{edit]after the final hold in the countdown at t-minus 9 minutes the shuttle went through its final preparations for launch and the countdown was automatically controlled by the ground launch sequencer (gls) software at the launch control center which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of the shuttle's onboard systems the gls handed off the count to the shuttle's on-board computers at t minus 31 seconds in a process called auto sequence startat t-minus 16 seconds the massive sound suppression system (sps) began to drench the mobile launcher platform (mlp) and srb trenches with 300000 us gallons (1100xc2xa0m3) of water to protect the orbiter from damage by acoustical energy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and mlp during lift off{74]{75]at t-minus 10 seconds hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase the main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time the computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phasespace shuttle main engine ignitionthe three main engines (ssmes) started at t-66 seconds the main engines ignited sequentially via the shuttle's general purpose computers (gpcs) at 120 millisecond intervals all three ssmes were required to reach 90 rated thrust within three seconds otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an rsls abort if all three engines indicated nominal performance by t-3 seconds they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the srbs for ignition at t-0{76] between t-66 seconds and t-3 seconds while the ssmes were firing but the srbs were still bolted to the pad the offset thrust caused the entire launch stack (boosters tank and orbiter) to pitch down 650xc2xa0mm (255xc2xa0in) measured at the tip of the external tank the three second delay after confirmation of ssme operation was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical at t-0 seconds the 8 frangible nuts holding the srbs to the pad were detonated the ssmes were commanded to 100 throttle and the srbs were ignited by t+023 seconds the srbs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence and reached maximum chamber pressure by t+06 seconds{77] the johnson space center's mission control center assumed control of the flight once the srbs had cleared the launch towershortly after liftoff the shuttle's main engines were throttled up to 1045 and the vehicle began a combined roll pitch and yaw maneuver that placed it onto the correct heading (azimuth) for the planned orbital inclination and in a heads down attitude with wings level the shuttle flew upside down during the ascent phase this orientation allowed a trim angle of attack that was favorable for aerodynamic loads during the region of high dynamic pressure resulting in a net positive load factor as well as providing the flight crew with a view of the horizon as a visual reference the vehicle climbed in a progressively flattening arc accelerating as the mass of the srbs and main tank decreased to achieve low orbit requires much more horizontal than vertical acceleration this was not visually obvious since the vehicle rose vertically and was out of sight for most of the horizontal acceleration the near circular orbital velocity at the 380 kilometers (236xc2xa0mi) altitude of the international space station is 27650xc2xa0kmh (17180xc2xa0mph) roughly equivalent to mach 23 at sea level as the international space station orbits at an inclination of 516 degrees missions going there must set orbital inclination to the same value in order to rendezvous with the stationaround 30 seconds into ascent the ssmes were throttled downxe2x80x94usually to 72 though this variedxe2x80x94to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces acting on the shuttle at a point called max q additionally the propellant grain design of the srbs caused their thrust to drop by about 30 by 50 seconds into ascent once the orbiter's guidance verified that max q would be within shuttle structural limits the main engines were throttled back up to 1045; this throttling down and back up was called the "thrust bucket" to maximize performance the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible{78]solid rocket booster (srb) separation during sts-1 the white external tank pictured was used on sts-1 and sts-2at around t+126 seconds pyrotechnic fasteners released the srbs and small separation rockets pushed them laterally away from the vehicle the srbs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused the shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines acceleration at this point would typically fall to 9 g and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose-up angle to the horizonxc2xa0xe2x80x93 it used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit at about five and three-quarter minutes into ascent the orbiter's direct communication links with the ground began to fade at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the tracking and data relay satellite systemat about seven and a half minutes into ascent the mass of the vehicle was low enough that the engines had to be throttled back to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 g (294xc2xa0msxc2xb2 or 965xc2xa0ftsxc2xb2 equivalent to accelerating from zero to 1059xc2xa0kmh (658xc2xa0mph) in a second) the shuttle would maintain this acceleration for the next minute and main engine cut-off (meco) occurred at about eight and a half minutes after launch{79] the main engines were shut down before complete depletion of propellant as running dry would have destroyed the engines the oxygen supply was terminated before the hydrogen supply as the ssmes reacted unfavorably to other shutdown modes (liquid oxygen has a tendency to react violently and supports combustion when it encounters hot engine metal) a few seconds after meco the external tank was released by firing pyrotechnic fastenersat this point the shuttle and external tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory coasting up towards apogee once at apogee about half an hour after meco the shuttle's orbital maneuvering system (oms) engines were fired to raise its perigee and achieve orbit while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the indian ocean or the pacific ocean depending on launch profile{65] the sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure relief systems on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere after the foam burned away during re-entry the heat caused a pressure buildup in the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen until the tank exploded this ensured that any pieces that fell back to earth were smallascent trackingcontraves-goerz kineto tracking mount used to image the space shuttle during launch ascentmulticolored afterglow of the sts-131 launchthe shuttle was monitored throughout its ascent for short range tracking (10 seconds before liftoff through 57 seconds after) medium range (7 seconds before liftoff through 110 seconds after) and long range (7 seconds before liftoff through 165 seconds after) short range cameras included 22 16mm cameras on the mobile launch platform and 8 16mm on the fixed service structure 4 high speed fixed cameras located on the perimeter of the launch complex plus an additional 42 fixed cameras with 16mm motion picture film medium range cameras included remotely operated tracking cameras at the launch complex plus 6 sites along the immediate coast north and south of the launch pad each with 800mm lens and high speed cameras running 100 frames per second these cameras ran for only 4xe2x80x9310 seconds due to limitations in the amount of film available long range cameras included those mounted on the external tank srbs and orbiter itself which streamed live video back to the ground providing valuable information about any debris falling during ascent long range tracking cameras with 400-inch film and 200-inch video lenses were operated by a photographer at playalinda beach as well as 9 other sites from 38 miles north at the ponce inlet to 23 miles south to patrick air force base (pafb) and additional mobile optical tracking camera was stationed on merritt island during launches a total of 10 hd cameras were used both for ascent information for engineers and broadcast feeds to networks such as nasa tv and hdnet the number of cameras significantly increased and numerous existing cameras were upgraded at the recommendation of the columbia accident investigation board to provide better information about the debris during launch debris was also tracked using a pair of weibel continuous pulse doppler x-band radars one on board the srb recovery ship mv liberty star positioned north east of the launch pad and on a ship positioned south of the launch pad additionally during the first 2 flights following the loss of columbia and her crew a pair of nasa wb-57 reconnaissance aircraft equipped with hd video and infrared flew at 60000 feet (18000xc2xa0m) to provide additional views of the launch ascent{80] kennedy space center also invested nearly 3xc2xa0million in improvements to the digital video analysis systems in support of debris tracking{81]in orbit{edit]once in orbit the shuttle usually flew at an altitude of 320xc2xa0km (170xc2xa0nmi) and occasionally as high as 650xc2xa0km (350xc2xa0nmi){82] in the 1980s and 1990s many flights involved space science missions on the nasaesa spacelab or launching various types of satellites and science probes by the 1990s and 2000s the focus shifted more to servicing the space station with fewer satellite launches most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks although longer missions were possible with

removed (june 2007) (learn how and when to remove this template message)almost the entire space shuttle re-entry procedure except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes was normally performed under computer control however the re-entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose the approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot but was usually hand flownglowing plasma trail from space shuttle atlantis re-entry as seen from the space stationthe vehicle began re-entry by firing the orbital maneuvering system engines while flying upside down backside first in the opposite direction to orbital motion for approximately three minutes which reduced the shuttle's velocity by about 200xc2xa0mph (322xc2xa0kmh) the resultant slowing of the shuttle lowered its orbital perigee down into the upper atmosphere the shuttle then flipped over by pushing its nose down (which was actually "up" relative to the earth because it was flying upside down) this oms firing was done roughly halfway around the globe from the landing sitethe vehicle started encountering more significant air density in the lower thermosphere at about 400000xc2xa0ft (120xc2xa0km) at around mach 25 8200xc2xa0ms (30000xc2xa0kmh; 18000xc2xa0mph) the vehicle was controlled by a combination of rcs thrusters and control surfaces to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude producing high drag not only to slow it down to landing speed but also to reduce reentry heating as the vehicle encountered progressively denser air it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft in a straight line its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out or even rise the vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep s-shaped banking turns each lasting several minutes at up to 70 degrees of bank while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack in this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards this occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry when the heat-shield glowed red and the g-forces were at their highest by the end of the last turn the transition to aircraft was almost complete the vehicle

346xc2xa0kmh (424 to 215xc2xa0mph) approximately at touch-down (compared to 260xc2xa0kmh or 160xc2xa0mph for a jet airliner) the landing gear was deployed while the orbiter was flying at 430xc2xa0kmh (270xc2xa0mph) to assist the speed brakes a 12xc2xa0m (39xc2xa0ft) drag chute was deployed either after main gear or nose gear touchdown (depending on selected chute deploy mode) at about 343xc2xa0kmh

shuttle columbia disasteron january 28 1986 challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launch due to the failure of the right srb killing all seven astronauts on board the disaster was caused by low-temperature impairment of an o-ring a mission critical seal used between segments of the srb casing failure of the o-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent external tank causing it to explode{96] repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the o-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53xc2xa0xc2xb0f (12xc2xa0xc2xb0c) had been ignored by nasa managers{97]on february 1 2003 columbia disintegrated during re-entry killing its crew of seven because of damage to the carbon-carbon leading edge of the wing caused during launch ground control engineers had made three separate requests for high-resolution images taken by the department of defense that would have provided an understanding of the extent of the damage while nasa's chief thermal protection system (tps) engineer requested that astronauts on board columbia be allowed to leave the vehicle to inspect the damage nasa managers intervened to stop the department of defense's assistance and refused the request for the spacewalk{98] and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or rescue by atlantis were not considered by nasa management at the time{99]retirement{edit]main article: space shuttle retirementatlantis orbiter's final welcome home 2011nasa retired the space shuttle in 2011 after 30 years of service the shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a "space truck" which would among other things be used to build a united states space station in low earth orbit in the early 1990s when the us space station evolved into the international space station project which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed the retirement of the space shuttle was delayed several times until 2011 serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned discovery was the first of nasa's three remaining operational space shuttles to be retired{100]the final space shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010 but the program was later extended to july 2011 when michael suffredini of the iss program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the international space station{101] the shuttle's final mission consisted of just four astronautsxe2x80x94christopher ferguson (commander) douglas hurley (pilot) sandra magnus (mission specialist 1) and rex walheim (mission specialist 2);{102] they conducted the 135th and last space shuttle mission on board atlantis which launched on july 8 2011 and landed safely at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 at 5:57 am edt (09:57 utc){103]distribution of orbiters and other hardware{edit]space shuttle program commemorative patchnasa announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the space shuttle program each museum or institution is responsible for covering the us288 million cost of preparing and transporting each vehicle for display twenty museums from across the country submitted proposals for receiving one of the retired orbiters{104] nasa also made space shuttle thermal protection system tiles available to schools and universities for less than us25 each{105] about 7000 tiles were available on a first-come first-served basis limited to one per institution{105]orbiters on display{edit]on april 12 2011 nasa announced selection of locations for the remaining shuttle orbiters:{106]{107]atlantis is on display at the kennedy space center visitor complex near cape canaveral florida it was delivered to the visitor complex on november 2 2012discovery was delivered to the udvar-hazy center of the smithsonian institution's national air and space

farewell flight the 747 and discovery flew over washington dc and the metropolitan area around 10xc2xa0am and arrived at dulles around 11xc2xa0am the flyover and landing were widely covered on national news mediaendeavour at los angeles international airportendeavour was delivered to the california science center in los angeles california on october 14 2012 it arrived at los angeles international airport on september 21 2012 concluding a two-day cross country journey atop the shuttle carrier aircraft after stops at ellington field in houston biggs army airfield in el paso and the dryden flight research facility at edwards air force base californiaenterprise (atmospheric test orbiter) was on display at the national air and space museum's udvar-hazy center but was moved to new york city's intrepid sea-air-space museum in mid-2012{58]in august 2011 the nasa office of inspector general (oig) published a "review of nasa's selection of display locations for the space shuttle orbiters"; the review had four main findings:{108]"nasa's decisions regarding orbiter placement were the result of an agency-created process that emphasized above all other considerations locating the orbiters in places where the most people would have the opportunity to view them";"the team made several errors during its evaluation process including one that would have resulted in a numerical 'tie' among the intrepid the kennedy visitor complex and the national museum of the us air force (air force museum) in dayton ohio";there is "no evidence that the teamxe2x80x99s recommendation or the administrator's decision were tainted by political influence or any other improper consideration";"some of the choices nasa made during the selection process xe2x80x93 specifically its decision to manage aspects of the selection as if it were a competitive procurement and to delay announcement of its placement decisions until april 2011 (more than 2 years after it first solicited information from interested entities)xe2x80x94may intensify challenges to the agency and the selectees as they work to complete the process of placing the orbiters in their new homes"the nasa oig had three recommendations saying nasa should:{108]"expeditiously review recipients' financial logistical and curatorial display plans to ensure they are feasible and consistent with the agency's educational goals and processing and delivery schedules";"ensure that recipient payments are closely coordinated with processing schedules do not impede nasa's ability to efficiently prepare the orbiters for museum display and provide sufficient funds in advance of the work to be performed; and""work closely with the recipient organizations to minimize the possibility of delays in the delivery schedule that could increase the agency's costs or impact other nasa missions and priorities"in september 2011 the ceo and two board members of seattle's museum of flight met with nasa administrator charles bolden pointing out "significant errors in deciding where to put its four retiring space shuttles"; the errors alleged include inaccurate information on museum of flight's attendance and international visitor statistics as well as the readiness of the intrepid sea-air-space museum's exhibit site{109]orbiter replicas on display{edit]independence formerly known as explorer is a full-scale high-fidelity replica of the space shuttle it was built by guard-lee in apopka florida installed at kennedy space center visitor complex in 1993 and moved to space center houston in 2012 it was built using schematics blueprints and archival documents provided by nasa and by shuttle contractors such as rockwell international while many of the features on the replica are simulated some parts including the landing gear's michelin tires have been used in the space shuttle program{110] the model is on display mounted on top of the original shuttle carrier aircraft (nasa 905) outside of the visitors' center{111]pathfinder (honorary orbiter vehicle designation: ov-098) is a space shuttle test simulator made of steel and wood constructed by nasa in 1977 as an unnamed test article it was purchased in the early 1980s by the america-japan society inc which had it refurbished named it and placed it on display in the great space shuttle exhibition in tokyo the mockup was later returned to the united states and placed on permanent display at the us space  rocket center in huntsville alabama in may 1988hardware on display{edit]flight and mid-deck training hardware will be taken from the johnson space center and will go to the national air and space museum and the national museum of the us air force the full fuselage mockup which includes the payload bay and aft section but no wings is to go to the museum of flight in seattle mission simulation and training facility's fixed simulator will go to the adler planetarium in chicago and the motion simulator will go to the texas am aerospace engineering department in college station texas other simulators used in shuttle astronaut training will go to the wings of dreams aviation museum in starke florida and the virginia air and space center in hampton virginia{104]space shuttle successors and legacy{edit]main article: space shuttle retirementsts conducted numerous experiments in space such as this ionization experimentsprint

the russian soyuz spacecrafta planned successor to sts was the "shuttle ii" during the 1980s and 1990s and later the constellation program during the 2004xe2x80x932010 period csts was a proposal to continue to operate sts commercially after nasa{112] in september 2011 nasa announced the selection of the design for the new space launch system that is planned to launch the orion spacecraft and other hardware to missions beyond low earth-orbit{113]{114]{115]the commercial orbital transportation services program began in 2006 with the purpose of creating commercially operated unmanned cargo vehicles to service the iss{116] the commercial crew development (ccdev) program was started in 2010 to create commercially operated manned spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the iss to stay docked for 180 days and then return them back to earth{117] these spacecraft were to become operational in the 2010s{118]in popular culture{edit]space shuttles have been features of fiction and nonfiction from children's movies to documentaries early examples include the 1979 james bond film moonraker the 1982 activision videogame space shuttle: a journey into space (1982) and g

shuttle named "the bat space shuttle" by dick grayson it's clearly based on the lego city set 3367 ("space shuttle") but is black and weapon-equippeda united states space shuttle stampthe space shuttle has also been the subject of toys and models; for example a large lego space shuttle model was constructed by visitors at kennedy space center{119] and smaller models have been sold commercially as a standard "legoland" set a 1980 pinball machine space shuttle was produced by zaccaria and a 1984 pinball machine space shuttle: pinball adventure was produced by williams and features a plastic space shuttle model among other artwork of astronauts on the play field the space shuttle also appears in a number of flight simulator and space flight simulator games such as
