b'thermal radiation - wikipedia thermal radiationfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchthis article is about any type of electromagnetic radiation from an object related to its temperature for infrared light see infrared"heat radiation" redirects here it is not to be confused with heat-ray (disambiguation)this article includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations (october 2007) (learn how and when to remove this template message)the peak wavelength and total radiated amount vary with temperature according to wien's displacement law although this shows relatively high temperatures the same relationships hold true for any temperature down to absolute zero visible light is between 380 and 750 nmthermal radiation in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork its emission in the infrared is invisible to the human eye and the camera the image was taken with but an infrared camera could show it (see thermography)thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation when the temperature of a body is greater than absolute zero inter-atomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change this results in charge-acceleration andor dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperatureexamples of thermal radiation include the visible light and infrared light emitted by an incandescent light bulb the infrared radiation emitted by animals that is detectable with an infrared camera and the cosmic microwave background radiation thermal radiation is different from thermal convection and thermal conductionxe2x80x94a person near a raging bonfire feels radiant heating from the fire even if the surrounding air is very coldsunlight is part of thermal radiation generated by the hot plasma of the sun the earth also emits thermal radiation but at a much lower intensity and different spectral distribution (infrared rather than visible) because it is cooler the earth's absorption of solar radiation followed by its outgoing thermal radiation have been held to be the two most important processes that determine the temperature and climate of the earth in most climate models however radiant-heat trapping by freely convective gases has never been demonstrated experimentally{1]if a radiation-emitting object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium the radiation is called blackbody radiation{2] planck's law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation which depends only on the object's temperature wien's displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation and the stefanxe2x80x93boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity{3]thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfercontents1

that has a temperature greater than absolute zero{4] it represents a conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy consists of the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter all matter with a temperature by definition is composed of particles which have kinetic energy and which interact with each other these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ie protons and electrons and kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge-acceleration and dipole-oscillation this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields resulting in the emission of photons radiating energy away from the body through its surface boundary electromagnetic radiation including light does not require the presence of matter to propagate and travels in the vacuum of space infinitely far if unobstructedthe characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface it is emanating from including its temperature its spectral absorptivity and spectral emissive power as expressed by kirchhoff's law{4] the radiation is not monochromatic ie it does not consist of just a single frequency but comprises a continuous dispersion of photon energies its characteristic spectrum if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths it is characterized as a black body a black body is also a perfect emitter the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the ratio of any body's emission relative to that of a black body is the body's emissivity so that a black body has an emissivity of unityabsorptivity reflectivity and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation for example fresh snow which is highly reflective to visible light (reflectivity about 090) appears white due to reflecting sunlight with a peak wavelength of about 05 micrometers its emissivity at a temperature of about xe2x88x925xc2xa0xc2xb0c (23xc2xa0xc2xb0f) peak wavelength of about 12 micrometers is 099the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by planck's law at any given temperature there is a frequency fmax at which the power emitted is a maximum wien's displacement law and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength indicates that the peak frequency fmax is proportional to the absolute temperature t of the black body the photosphere of the sun at a temperature of approximately 6000 k emits radiation principally in the (humanly) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earth's atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected earth's surface emits the absorbed radiation approximating the behavior of a black body at 300xc2xa0k with spectral peak at fmax at these lower frequencies the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere though some radiation escapes into space most is absorbed and then re-emitted by atmospheric gases it is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary greenhouse effect contributing to global warming and climate change in general (but also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing)the incandescent light bulb has a spectrum overlapping the black body spectra of the sun and the earth some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at 3000xc2xa0k are in the visible spectrum most of the energy is associated with photons of longer wavelengths; these do not help a person see but still transfer heat to the environment as can be deduced empirically by observing an incandescent light bulb whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed heat is transferred this principle is used in microwave ovens laser cutting and rf hair removalunlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer thermal radiation can be concentrated in a tiny spot by using reflecting mirrors concentrating solar power takes advantage of this fact in many such systems mirrors are employed to concentrate sunlight into a smaller area instead of mirrors fresnel lenses can also be used to concentrate heat flux (in principle any kind of lens can be used but only the fresnel lens design is practical for very large lenses) either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight for example the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the ps10 solar power plant and during the day it can heat water to 285xc2xa0xc2xb0c (55815xc2xa0k) or 545xc2xa0xc2xb0fsurface effects{edit]lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less illuminating light and thus heat up less; but otherwise color makes small difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings since the dominant emitted wavelengths are nowhere near the visible spectrum but rather in the far infrared emissivities at those wavelengths have little to do with visual emissivities (visible colors); in the far infra-red most objects have high emissivities thus except in sunlight the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth; likewise paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlitthe main exception to this is shiny metal surfaces which have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions; an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate spacecraftlow-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible lightnanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency eg for cooling photovoltaic cells and buildings these applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range a selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sinkpersonalized cooling technology is another example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection however the human body is a very efficient emitter of ir radiation which provides additional cooling mechanism most conventional fabrics are opaque to ir radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable ir transmission to directly pass through clothing while being opaque at visible wavelengths fabrics that are transparent in the infrared can radiate body heat at rates that will significantly reduce the burden on power-hungry air-conditioning systemsproperties{edit]there are four main properties that characterize thermal radiation (in the limit of the far field):thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies the frequency distribution is given by planck's law of black-body radiation for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at topthe dominant frequency (or color) range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases for example a red hot object radiates mainly in the long wavelengths (red and orange) of the visible band if it is heated further it also begins to emit discernible amounts of green and blue light and the spread of frequencies in the entire visible range cause it to appear white to the human eye; it is white hot even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k 99 of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared this is determined by wien's displacement law in the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increasesthe total amount of radiation of all frequencies increases steeply as the temperature rises; it grows as t4 where t is the absolute temperature of the body an object at the temperature of a kitchen oven about twice the room temperature on the absolute temperature scale (600 k vs 300 k) radiates 16 times as much power per unit area an object at the temperature of the filament in an incandescent light bulbxe2x80x94roughly 3000 k or 10 times room temperaturexe2x80x94radiates 10000 times as much energy per unit area the total radiative intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature as expressed by the stefanxe2x80x93boltzmann law in the plot the area under each curve grows rapidly as the temperature increasesthe rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source thus a surface that absorbs more red light thermally radiates more red light this principle applies to all properties of the wave including wavelength (color) direction polarization and even coherence so that it is quite possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized coherent and directional though polarized and coherent forms are fairly rare in nature far from sources (in terms of wavelength) see section below for more on this qualificationnear-field and far-field{edit]the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the planck's law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered' (typically from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k) indeed thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves (far-field or electromagnetic radiation) into account a more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface (near-field thermal radiation) for example although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent near-field thermal radiation (ie radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths) may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence{5]planck's law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions this deviation is especially strong (up to several orders in magnitude) when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects however to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers this limitation significantly complicates practical device designsanother way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself this approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells wires and dots and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two- and three-dimensional potential traps including wells wires and dots such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies to achieve the required level of photon confinement the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by planck's law most importantly the emission spectrum of thermal wells wires and dots deviates from planck's law predictions not only in the near field but also in the far field which significantly expands the range of their applicationssubjective color to the eye of a black body thermal radiator{edit]xc2xb0c (xc2xb0f)subjective

of energy{edit]radiant heat panel for testing precisely quantified energy exposures at national research council near ottawa ontario canadathermal radiation is one of the principal mechanisms of heat transfer it entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object's temperature other mechanisms are convection and conduction the interplay of energy exchange by thermal radiation is characterized by the following equation:xcexb1+xcfx81+xcfx84=1{displaystyle alpha +rho +au =1}here xcexb1{displaystyle alpha } represents the spectral absorption component xcfx81{displaystyle rho } spectral reflection component and xcfx84{displaystyle au } the spectral transmission component these elements are a function of the wavelength (xcexbb{displaystyle lambda }) of the electromagnetic radiation the spectral absorption is equal to the emissivity xcfxb5{displaystyle epsilon }; this relation is known as kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation an object is called a black body if for all frequencies the following formula applies:xcexb1=xcfxb5=1{displaystyle alpha =epsilon =1}in a practical situation and room-temperature setting humans lose considerable energy due to thermal radiation the energy lost by emitting infrared radiation is partially regained by absorbing the heat flow due to conduction from surrounding objects and the remainder resulting from generated heat through metabolism human skin has an emissivity of very close to 10{9] using the formulas below shows a human having roughly 2 square meter in surface area and a temperature of about 307xc2xa0k continuously radiates approximately 1000xc2xa0watts if people are indoors surrounded by surfaces at 296xc2xa0k they receive back about 900xc2xa0watts from the wall ceiling and other surroundings so the net loss is only about 100xc2xa0watts these heat transfer estimates are highly dependent on extrinsic variables such as wearing clothes ie decreasing total thermal circuit conductivity therefore reducing total output heat flux only truly gray systems (relative equivalent emissivityabsorptivity and no directional transmissivity dependence in all control volume bodies considered) can achieve reasonable steady-state heat flux estimates through the stefan-boltzmann law encountering this "ideally calculable" situation is almost impossible (although common engineering procedures surrender the dependency of these unknown variables and "assume" this to be the case) optimistically these "gray" approximations will get close to real solutions as most divergence from stefan-boltzmann solutions is very small (especially in most stp lab controlled environments)if objects appear white (reflective in the visual spectrum) they are not necessarily equally reflective (and thus non-emissive) in the thermal infrared most household radiators are painted white but this is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat and are not designed as thermal radiators at all - they are actually convectors and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93 blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature{10] (meaning the term "black body" does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object) these materials that do not follow the "black color = high emissivityabsorptivity" caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivityabsorptivity dependencecalculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of object including a 'cavity' or 'surroundings' requires solution of a set of simultaneous equations using the radiosity method in these calculations the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called view factors which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface these calculations are important in the fields of solar thermal energy boiler and furnace design and raytraced computer graphicsa comparison of a thermal image (top) and an ordinary photograph (bottom) shows that a trash bag is transparent but glass (the man's spectacles) is opaque in long-wavelength infrareda selective surface can be used when energy is being extracted from the sun for instance when a green house is made most of the roof and walls are made out of glass glass is transparent in the visible (approximately 04xc2xa0xc2xb5m<xcexbb<08xc2xa0xc2xb5m) and near-infrared wavelengths but opaque to mid- to far-wavelength infrared (approximately xcexbb>3xc2xa0xc2xb5m){11]{12] therefore glass lets in radiation in the visible range allowing us to be able to see through it but does not let out radiation that is emitted from objects at or close to room temperature this traps what we feel as heat this is known as the greenhouse effect and can be observed by getting into a car that has been sitting in the sun{citation needed] selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors we can find out how much help a selective surface coating is by looking at the equilibrium temperature of a plate that is being heated through solar radiation if the plate is receiving a solar irradiation of 1350xc2xa0wmxc2xb2 (minimum is 1325xc2xa0wmxc2xb2 on julyxc2xa04 and maximum is 1418xc2xa0wmxc2xb2 on januaryxc2xa03) from the sun the temperature of the plate where the radiation leaving is equal to the radiation being received by the plate is 393xc2xa0k (248xc2xa0xc2xb0f) if the plate has a selective surface with an emissivity of 09 and a cut off wavelength of 20xc2xa0xc2xb5m the equilibrium temperature is approximately 1250xc2xa0k (1790xc2xa0xc2xb0f) the calculations were made neglecting convective heat transfer and neglecting the solar irradiation absorbed in the cloudsatmosphere for simplicity the theory is still the same for an actual problemto reduce the heat transfer from a surface such as a glass window a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface xe2x80x9clow-emittance (low-e) coatings are microscopically thin virtually invisible metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the u-factor by suppressing radiative heat flowxe2x80x9d{13] by adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the windowradiative power{edit]power emitted by a black body plotted against the temperature according to

emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body is often known as a grey body for frequency-dependent emissivity the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence though in general there is no simple expression for it practically speaking if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integralconstants{edit]definitions of constants used in the above equations:h{displaystyle h}planck's
