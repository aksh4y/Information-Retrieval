arabic{10]{11] it is a pluricentric language with two official forms modern standard hindi and modern standard urdu{12] which are its standardised registers and which may be called hindustani or hindi-urdu when taken together{13] the colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary with urdu adopting stronger persian and arabic influences and hindi relying more heavily on sanskrit{14]{15] before the partition of the british indian empire the terms hindustani urdu and hindi were synonymous; all covered what would be mostly called urdu and hindi today{16] the term hindustani is still used for the colloquial language and the lingua franca of

linkshistory{edit]main article: history of hindustaniearly forms of present-day hindustani developed from the middle indo-aryan apabhramsha vernaculars of present-day north india in the 7thxe2x80x9313th centuries{17] amir khusro who lived in the 13th century ce during the delhi sultanate period in north india used these forms (which was the lingua franca of the period) in his writings and referred to it as hindavi{17] the delhi sultanate which comprised several turkic and afghan dynasties that ruled from delhi{18] was succeeded by the mughal empire in 1526although the mughals were of timurid (gurkxc4x81nxc4xab) turko-mongol descent{19] they were persianised and persian had gradually become the state language of the mughal empire after babur{20]{21]{22]{23] a continuation since the introduction of persian by central asian turkic rulers in the indian subcontinent{24] and the patronisation of it by the earlier turko-afghan delhi sultanate the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianised central asian turkic and afghan dynasties{25]in the 18th century towards the end of the mughal period with the fragmentation of the empire and the elite system a variant of khariboli one of the successors of apabhramsha vernaculars at delhi and nearby cities came to gradually replace persian as the lingua franca among the educated elite upper class particularly in northern india though persian still retained much of its pre-eminence for a short period the term hindustani (literally "of hindustan") was the name given to that variant of kharibolifor socio-political reasons though essentially the variant of khariboli with persian vocabulary the emerging prestige dialect became also known as urdu (properly zabxc4x81n-e urdu-e mo'alla "language of the court" or zabxc4x81n-e urdu xd8xb2xd8xa8xd8xa7xd9x86 xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xafxd9x88xe2x80x8e

due to its origin as the common speech of the mughal army) the more highly persianised version later established as a language of the court was called rekhta or "mixed"as an emerging common dialect hindustani absorbed large numbers of persian arabic and turkic words and as mughal conquests grew it spread as a lingua franca across much of northern india written in the perso-arabic script or devanagari script{26] it remained the primary lingua franca of northern india for the next four centuries (although it varied significantly in vocabulary depending on the local language) and achieved the status of a literary language alongside persian in muslim courts its development was centred on the poets of the mughal courts of cities in uttar pradesh such as delhi lucknow and agrajohn fletcher hurst in his book published in 1891 mentioned that the hindustani or camp language or language of the camps of moughal courts at delhi was not regarded by philologists as distinct language but only as a dialect of hindi with admixture of persian he continued: "but it has all the magnitude and importance of separate language it is linguistic result of muslim rule of eleventh  twelfth centuries and is spoken (except in rural bengal ) by many hindus in north india and by musalman population in all parts of india" next to english it was the official language of british indian empire was commonly written in arabic or persian characters and was spoken by approximately 100000000 people{27]when the british colonised the indian subcontinent from the late 18th through to the late 19th century they used the words 'hindustani' 'hindi' and 'urdu' interchangeably they developed it as the language of administration of british india{28] further preparing it to be the official language of modern india and pakistan however with independence use of the word 'hindustani' declined being largely replaced by 'hindi' and 'urdu' or 'hindi-urdu' when either of those was too specific more recently the word 'hindustani' has been used for the colloquial language of bollywood films which are popular in both india and pakistan and which cannot be unambiguously identified as either hindi or urduregisters{edit]see also: hindixe2x80x93urdu controversy and register (sociolinguistics)although at the spoken level hindi and urdu are considered registers of a single language they differ vastly in literary and formal vocabulary; where literary hindi draws heavily on sanskrit and to a lesser extent prakrit literary urdu draws heavily on persian and arabic the grammar and base vocabulary (most pronouns verbs adpositions etc) of both hindi and urdu however are the same and derive from a prakritic base and both have a persianarabic influencethe standardised registers hindi and urdu are collectively known as hindi-urdu hindustani is perhaps the lingua franca of the north and west of the indian subcontinent though it is understood fairly well in other regions also especially in the urban areas a common vernacular sharing characteristics with sanskritised hindi regional hindi and urdu hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly sanskritised hindi or highly arabicisedpersianised urduthis can be seen in the popular culture of bollywood or more generally the vernacular of north indians and pakistanis which generally employs a lexicon common to both hindi and urdu speakers minor subtleties in region will also affect the 'brand' of hindustani sometimes pushing the hindustani closer to urdu or to hindi one might reasonably assume that the hindustani spoken in lucknow uttar pradesh (known for its usage of urdu) and varanasi (a holy city for hindus and thus using highly sanskritised hindi) is somewhat differentmodern standard hindi{edit]rigveda manuscript in devanagari (early 19th century)main article: hindistandard hindi one of the official languages of india is based on the khariboli dialect of the delhi region and differs from urdu in that it is usually written in the indigenous devanagari script of india and exhibits less persian and arabic influence than urdu many scholars today employ a sanskritised form of hindi developed primarily in varanasi the hindu holy city which is based on the eastern hindi dialect of that region and thus a separate language from official standard hindi{citation needed] it has a literature of 500 years with prose poetry religion  philosophy under the bahmani kings and later on khutab shahi adil shahi etc it is a living language still prevalent all over the deccan plateau note that the term hindustani has generally fallen out of common usage in modern india except to refer to "indian" as a nationality{29] and a style of indian classical music prevalent in northern india the term used to refer to it is hindi or urdu depending on the religion of the speaker and regardless of the mix of persian or sanskrit words used by the speaker one could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers with the highly persianised urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily sanskrit-based dialect spoken in the region around varanasi at the other end of the spectrum in common usage in india the term hindi includes all these dialects except those at the urdu end of the spectrum thus the different meanings of the word hindi include among others:standardised hindi as taught in schools throughout india (except some states such as tamil nadu)formal or official hindi advocated by purushottam das tandon and as instituted by the post-independence indian government heavily influenced by sanskritthe vernacular dialects of hindustani as spoken throughout indiathe neutralised form of hindustani used in popular television and films orthe more formal neutralised form of hindustani used in broadcast and print news reportsmodern standard urdu{edit]the phrase zabxc4x81n-e urdu-e mo'alla written in nasta'liq calligraphymain article: urduurdu is the national language of pakistan and an

article: hindi dialectsin a specific sense hindustani may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech in contrast with the standardised hindi and urdu this meaning is reflected in the use of the term bazaar hindustani in other words the "language of the street or the marketplace" as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal hindi urdu or even sanskrit thus the webster's new world dictionary defines the term hindustani as the principal dialect of hindiurdu used as a trade language throughout north india and pakistannames{edit]amir khusro ca 1300 referred to this language of his writings as dahlavi ('of delhi') or hindavi (xe0xa4xb9xe0xa4xbfxe0xa4xa8xe0xa5x8dxe0xa4xa6xe0xa4xb5xe0xa5x80 xdbx81xd9x86xd8xafxd9x88xdbx8cxe2x80x8e 'of hindustan') during this period hindustani was used by sufis in promulgating their message across the indian subcontinent{30] after the advent of the mughals in the subcontinent hindustani acquired more persian loanwords rekhta ('mixture') and hindi (of 'hindustan'){26] became popular names for the same language until the 18th century{31] the name urdu appeared around 1780{31] during the british raj the term hindustani was used by british officials{31] in 1796 john borthwick gilchrist published a "a grammar of the hindoostanee language"{31]{32] upon partition india and pakistan established national standards that they called hindi and urdu respectively and attempted to make distinct with the result that hindustani commonly but mistakenly came to be seen as a mixture of hindi and urdugrierson in his highly influential linguistic survey of india proposed that the names hindustani urdu and hindi be separated in use for different varieties of the hindustani language rather than as the overlapping synonyms they frequently were:we may now define the three main varieties of hindxc5x8dstxc4x81nxc4xab as follows:xe2x80x94hindxc5x8dstxc4x81nxc4xab is primarily the language of the upper gangetic doab and is also the lingua franca of india capable of being written in both persian and dxc4x93va-nxc4x81garxc4xab characters and without purism avoiding alike the excessive use of either persian or sanskrit words when employed for literature the name 'urdxc5xab' can then be confined to that special variety of hindxc5x8dstxc4x81nxc4xab in which persian words are of frequent occurrence and which hence can only be written in the persian character and similarly 'hindxc4xab' can be confined to the form of hindxc5x8dstxc4x81nxc4xab in which sanskrit words abound and which hence can only be written in the dxc4x93va-nxc4x81garxc4xab character{33]literature{edit]main articles: hindi literature and urdu literatureofficial status{edit]hindustani in its standardised registers is one of the

india's independence in 1947 the sub-committee on fundamental rights recommended that the official language of india be hindustani:"hindustani written either in devanagari or the perso-arabic script
