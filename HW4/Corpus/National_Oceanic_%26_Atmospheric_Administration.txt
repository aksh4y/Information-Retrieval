atmospheric administration (noaa; pronounced xcbx88noxcax8axc9x99 like "noah") is an american scientific agency within the united states department of commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere noaa warns of dangerous weather charts seas guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment in addition to its over 11000 civilian employees{3] noaa research and operations are supported by 321 uniformed service members who make up the noaa commissioned officer corps{4] noaa traces its history back to the convergence of multiple agencies: the united states coastal and geodetic survey (founded in 1807) the weather bureau (1870) and the bureau of commercial fisheries (1871) noaa was officially formed in 1970{5] the acting under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at the department of commerce and the agency's interim administrator has been

in society the benefits of which extend beyond the us economy and into the larger global community:a supplier of environmental information products noaa supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere this is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the national weather service but noaa's information products extend to climate ecosystems and commerce as wella provider of environmental stewardship services noaa is a steward of us coastal and marine environments in coordination with federal state local tribal and international authorities noaa manages the use of these environments regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine speciesa leader in applied scientific research noaa is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above: ecosystems climate weather and water and commerce and transportation{8]the five "fundamental activities" are:monitoring and observing earth systems with instruments and data collection networksunderstanding and describing earth systems through research and analysis of that dataassessing and predicting the changes of these systems over timeengaging advising and informing the public and partner organizations with important informationmanaging resources for the betterment of society economy and environment{9]history{edit]seal of the noaa commissioned corpsnoaa was formed on october 3 1970 after us president richard nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for "better protection of life and property from natural hazardsxe2x80xa6for a better understanding of the total environmentxe2x80xa6{and] for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources" noaa formed a conglomeration of several existing scientific agencies that were among the oldest in the federal government they were the united states coast and geodetic survey formed in 1807; the weather bureau formed in 1870xe2x80x94geodetic survey and weather service had been combined by a 1965 consolidation into the environmental science services administration (essa) including the uniformed commissioned corp (founded 1917); and the bureau of commercial fisheries formed in 1871 noaa was established within the department of commerce via the reorganization plan no 4 of 1970{10] in 2007 noaa celebrated 200 years of service with its ties to the united states coast and geodetic survey{11]organizational structure{edit]noaa headquarters in silver spring marylandthe noaa commissioned officer corps is a uniformed service of men and women who operate noaa ships and aircraft and serve in scientific and administrative postsnoaa works toward its mission through six major line offices the national environmental satellite data and information service (nesdis) the national marine fisheries service (nmfs) the national ocean service (nos) the national weather service (nws) the office of oceanic and atmospheric research (oar) and the office of marine  aviation operations (omao){12] and in addition more than a dozen staff offices including the office of the federal coordinator for meteorology the noaa central library the office of program planning and integration (ppi){12]national weather service{edit]seal of the national weather servicethe national weather service (nws) is tasked with providing "weather hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the united states its territories adjacent waters and ocean areas for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy" this is done through a collection of national and regional centers 13 river forecast centers (rfcs) and more than 120 local weather forecast offices (wfos) they are charged with issuing weather and river forecasts advisories watches and warnings on a daily basis they issue more than 734000 weather and 850000 river forecasts and more than 45000 severe weather warnings annually noaa data is also relevant to the issues of global warming and ozone depletion{citation needed]the nws operates nexrad a nationwide network of doppler weather radars which can detect precipitation and their velocities many of their products are broadcast on noaa weather radio a network of radio transmitters that broadcasts weather forecasts severe weather statements watches and warnings 24 hours a day{13]national ocean service{edit]the national ocean service (nos) focuses on ensuring that ocean and coastal areas are safe healthy and productive nos scientists natural resource managers and specialists serve america by ensuring safe and efficient marine transportation promoting innovative solutions to protect coastal communities and conserving marine and coastal places{citation needed]the national ocean service is

flown as a distinguishing mark by all commissioned noaa shipsthe noaa flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations the united states coast and geodetic survey the coast and geodetic survey's flag authorized in 1899 and in use until 1970 was blue with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle it symbolized the use of triangulation in surveying and was flown by ships of the survey{citation needed]when noaa was established in 1970 and the coast and geodetic survey's assets became a part of noaa noaa based its own flag on that of the coast and geodetic survey the noaa flag is in essence the coast and geodetic survey flag with the noaa logoxe2x80x94a circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section but with the "noaa" legend omittedxe2x80x94centered within the red triangle noaa ships in commission display the noaa flag; those with only one mast fly it immediately beneath the ship's commissioning pennant or the personal flag of a civilian official or flag officer if one is aboard the ship while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost mast{40] noaa ships fly the same ensign as united states navy ships but fly the noaa flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from navy shipssee also{edit]underwater diving portalcenter for
