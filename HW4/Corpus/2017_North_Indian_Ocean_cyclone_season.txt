ocean cyclone season is a current event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation north indian ocean cyclone season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between april and december with the two peaks in may and november these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern indian oceanthe scope of this article is limited to the indian ocean in the northern hemisphere east of the horn of africa and west of the malay peninsula there are two main seas in the north indian oceanxc2xa0xe2x80x94 the arabian sea to the west of the indian subcontinent abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department (imd); and the bay of bengal to the east abbreviated bob by the imd the official regional specialized meteorological centre in this basin is the imd while the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) releases unofficial advisories on average three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season{1]{2]contents1

according to accuweather{3] the best chance for tropical depressions or cyclones in the bay of bengal or the arabian sea will be during october and november during september one or two systems may be declared a depression over the northern bay of bengal and could strike eastern india in west bengal or orissa coasts{4] according to myanmar meteorological department a cyclone or depression is likely to form in the last week of october in andaman sea and travel towards the bay of bengal{5]season summary{edit]the season officially had an early start compared with the last two seasons with the formation of cyclone maarutha over the bay of bengal in mid-aprilthe strongest storm of the season so far was cyclone mora which formed in late may over the bay of bengal the system made landfall in bangladesh with three-minute sustained winds of 110xc2xa0kmh (70xc2xa0mph) and one-minute sustained winds of 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) at this strength its peak intensity it was equivalent to a marginal category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale the cyclone produced severe flooding across sri lanka india  myanmar and bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 203 deaths indirectly the floods persisted in bangladesh since a deep depression over bay of bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in bangladesh a depression formed in northwestern bay of bengal and produced torrential rainfall it was followed by a depression over jharkhand which killed 70 people in west bengal under the influence of strong monsoon surge a disturbance developed over bay of bengal travelled westwards and intensified to a depression it also affected neighboring karachi in pakistansystems{edit]cyclonic storm maarutha{edit]cyclonic stormxc2xa0(imd)tropical

pressure formed in the south bay of bengal under the influence of a persistent area of convection in a span of six hours{6] under favorable conditions rapid deepening took place and the system was classified as a depression on april 15{7] later on the same day it further intensified into a deep depression and then into cyclonic storm maaruthathe system moved very fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in westerlies lying over india in the middle and upper tropospheric levels{8] however strong vertical wind shear and unfavourable mjo inhibited rapid intensification or further intensification of the system moving northeastwards it reached its peak intensity in the early hours of 16th the system maintained its peak intensity till landfall near sandoway (thandwe) in myanmar in the midnight after landfall the system weakened into a deep depression in early hours of 17th into a depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th{9]maarutha had already triggered heavy rainfall as a depression in sri lanka as well as the andaman and nicobar islands (india) due to a heavy swell in the sea around the andaman islands all ferries to havelock island from port blair were suspended on leaving nearly 1500 tourists stranded{10] in kyaukpyu maarutha destroyed more than 81 households and total damages amounted to ks318 million (us23400) as of april 18{11] four people were reported to be killed in the irrawady division of myanmar{12]{13] maarutha developed as a depression in the first fortnight of april climatologically the formation of tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal at this time of the year is rare only twelve cyclones have developed over the bay of bengal during

coast the system was then given the identifier land 02 by the imd the storm intensified further into a deep depression later on the same day{41] moving in a north-northwesterly direction the storm interacted with an anticyclonic circulation which caused it to weaken rapidly into a low pressure area over west jharkhand on october 10the system produced heavy rainfall in east india{42] and also caused caused 3 deaths in odisha by lightning and heavy rainfall{43]{44] kolkata was badly affected by the dangerous weather receiving rain upto 1244 mm{45] strong winds along with incessant rains slowed down traffic uprooted trees and collapsed buildings{46] departure of flights from kolkata airport were canceled due to strong crosswinds; at least 23 domestic flights were diverted due to the

while located in a marginally favorable environment for further development{52] later that day the imd upgraded the system to depression bob 05 as the system developed formative banding surrounding a center of deep thunderstorm activity{53]{54] despite being initially forecasted to intensify further the depression tracked into an environment with strong wind shear and failed to intensify making landfall on the odisha coast near paradip during the afternoon of 20 october{55] after landfall the system remained near the coastline allowing moisture incursion from the bay of bengal to prevent rapid weakening initially tracking northwards the system soon recurved towards the northeast before weakening into an area of low pressure early on 22 october while located over northeastern bangladesh meghalaya and southern assam{56]on 20 october the odisha state government declared the heavy rains caused by the storm as a "state-specific disaster" up to 25 blocks of eight districts in the state had received rainfall exceeding 135xc2xa0mm (5xc2xa0in) with the kanas block of the puri distict recording rainfall of 274xc2xa0mm (10xc2xa0in) heavy damage to homes were reported in balasore and bhadrak districts with an infant reported to have died in the former district following the collapse of a wall{57]{58]west bengal was similarly affected by torrential rain with kolkata reporting 110xc2xa0mm (5xc2xa0in) of rain and the bankura district reporting 279xc2xa0mm (10xc2xa0in) in the east midnapore district a key bridge linking the seaside tourist destinations of shankarpur and tajpur collapsed due to strong waves and a storm surge of 15xc2xa0m (5xc2xa0ft) from the bay of bengal as the storm passed through the area large portions of the jamura-shyampur village near the bridge were similarly reported to have been inundated by the storm surge in addition the town of cherapunji in meghalaya reported rainfall of 283xc2xa0mm (10xc2xa0in) xe2x80x93 among the highest reported in association with the depression{59]{60]in bangladesh the ports of chittagong cox's bazar mongla and payra raised signal no 3 as a result of the strong crosswinds and heavy rainfall{61] heavy rainfall was witnessed in the country with the highest total reported at gopalganj of 279xc2xa0mm (10xc2xa0in) of rain{62]storm names{edit]within this basin a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm intensity with winds of 62xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) the names were selected by members of the escapwmo panel on tropical cyclones between 2000 and may 2004 before the regional specialized meteorological center in new delhi started to assign names in september 2004 there is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin from the western pacific then it will retain its original name the next six
