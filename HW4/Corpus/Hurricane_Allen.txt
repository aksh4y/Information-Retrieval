seasonhurricane allen was a rare and extremely powerful cape verde-type hurricane that struck the caribbean eastern and northern mexico and southern texas in august 1980 the first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 atlantic hurricane season it was one of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history it was one of the few hurricanes to reach categoryxc2xa05 status on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions and spent more time as a categoryxc2xa05 than all but two other atlantic hurricanes allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190xc2xa0mph (305xc2xa0kmh){nb 1] thus making it the strongest atlantic hurricane by wind speed until hurricane patricia in 2015 these were also the highest sustained winds in the western hemispherethroughout its life allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to north-westerly course through the tropical atlantic ocean caribbean sea and gulf of mexico before making its final landfall near the united statesxe2x80x93mexico border at peak strength it passed near haiti causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage after crossing the gulf of mexico allen weakened as it struck the lower texas coast causing high winds a significant storm surge and heavy rainfall which caused damage to southern texas overall allen killed at least 269 people and left just over 7009124000000000000xe2x99xa0124xc2xa0billion in damages (1980 us dollars) or 400 billion in 2016 dollars mostly within the united states and haiti because of its impact the name allen was retired from the six-year revolving list of atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and the name was replaced by andrew the name andrew was subsequently retired after the 1992 season's hurricane andrew the remnants of the storm precipitated the end of the heat wave of 1980 in places like dallasfort worth texas which had recorded 69 days of 100xc2xa0xc2xb0f (38xc2xa0xc2xb0c)

linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleallen was an early cape verde-type hurricane which originated from a tropical wave that previously moved off the african coastline on july 30 the system developed as it moved westward becoming a tropical depression on august 1{1] however the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on allen until almost 24 hours later when it was centered 1300xc2xa0mi (2100xc2xa0km) east of the windward islands{2] early on august 2 as the depression moved towards the caribbean it had intensified and became the first named storm of the season{1] the national hurricane center noted that conditions appeared favorable for further intensification however it was also noted that a large cold-low north of puerto rico was producing strong westerly wind shear which would cause allen to possibly encounter unfavorable conditions within 72 hours{3] although slower forward movement was anticipated{4] allen remained at generally the same westward pace between 17 and 23xc2xa0mph (27 and 37xc2xa0kmh){1] by august 3 the national hurricane center retracted predictions of less favorable conditions from the cold-low north of puerto rico since that weather system was weakening and moving westward{5]most intense atlantic

upgraded allen to hurricane status as an air force plane recorded winds of 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh){7] however in post-analysis it was discovered that allen had been a hurricane since 0000 utc on august 3 shortly after the upgrade allen began a period of rapid deepening and intensified into a major hurricane at 0000 utc august 4 while roughly 38xc2xa0mi (61xc2xa0km) northwest of bridgetown barbados six hours later allen passed only 8xc2xa0mi (13xc2xa0km) south of st lucia at 0600 utc{1] although the national hurricane center noted that conditions favored slow strengthening{8] allen continued to rapidly intensify and became a category 4 hurricane only two hours after that advisory{1] later on august 4 the national hurricane center noted a barometric pressure of 946xc2xa0mbar (946xc2xa0hpa; 279xc2xa0inhg) and that it would not drop significantly within 24 hours{9] shortly before 0000 utc on august 5 the minimum pressure decreased to 924xc2xa0mbar (924xc2xa0hpa; 273xc2xa0inhg) which was noted as equivalent to hurricane david in the previous season{10]by august 5 allen intensified into a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane while south of puerto rico this made allen the earliest category 5 hurricane in the atlantic on record{1] but was later surpassed by hurricane emily which reached that intensity on july 16 2005 during this time allen attained a central pressure of 911xc2xa0mbar (911xc2xa0hpa; 269xc2xa0inhg) the lowest pressure on record in the eastern caribbean sea hence the barometric pressure dropped by 35xc2xa0mbar (35xc2xa0hpa; 10xc2xa0inhg) less than 10 hours after the national hurricane center stated that the pressure would not decrease significantly within the time of 24 hoursthe eye passed between hispaniola and jamaica as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane after friction with the mountains of haiti and jamaica had caused it to weaken allen intensified back to a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane retaining this intensity for over a day it then moved past the islands of cayman brac and little cayman causing moderate damage on cayman brac with winds near 135xc2xa0mph the storm then moved between cuba and the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula reaching its peak intensity of 190xc2xa0mph (310xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 899xc2xa0mbar (899xc2xa0hpa; 265xc2xa0inhg) while crossing the yucatxc3xa1n channel during allen's trek through the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico its center of circulation never crossed over land despite its close passage to various islands in and around the caribbean sea{6]allen again weakened to a categoryxc2xa04 storm due to friction with mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle but restrengthened into a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane for a third time as it moved over the open waters of the gulf of mexico keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to 909xc2xa0mbar (909xc2xa0hpa; 268xc2xa0inhg) the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western gulf of mexico shortly before landfall a dry air mass in the western gulf of mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially allen made landfall north of brownsville texas as a categoryxc2xa03 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) it became extratropical on august 11{6]preparations{edit]hurricane allen in the gulf of mexico on august 8 1980as allen approached the caribbean sea gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the islands of barbados st lucia st vincent dominica grenada martinique and guadeloupe during the daylight hours of august 3 gale warnings were in effect for antigua from 11xc2xa0am on august 3 until 11xc2xa0am on august 4 hurricane warnings were raised for barbados st vincent st lucia martinique and dominica from the early afternoon of august 3 until the late morning of august 4 as allen moved into the caribbean sea hurricane watches were issued for southeastern sections of the dominican republic and the southwestern peninsula of haiti from 11xc2xa0am on august 4 until the morning of august 5 gale warnings were then in effect for the southern dominican republic from the night of august 4 into the night of august 5 while southern haiti maintained the warnings from the night of august 4 into the morning of august 5 the hurricane watch was issued for jamaica during the morning hours of august 5 while hurricane warnings were raised for the southwest peninsula of haiti from the late morning of august 5 into the morning of august 6{11] hurricane warnings went into effect for jamaica from around noon on august 5 until late in the afternoon of august 6 the cayman islands saw hurricane watches issued from the afternoon of august 5 into the morning of august 6 before the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from the morning until late afternoon of august

were in effect for the florida keys from the evening of august 6 into the early morning of august 8 as allen approached its final landfall the northeast mexican coast and texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of august 8 until the morning of august 9 for mexico and the afternoon of august 9 for texas hurricane warnings were posted for the texas coast during the afternoon of august 8 and were lowered north of freeport texas during the afternoon of august 9 and south of freeport during the afternoon of august 10 gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the louisiana coast from vermilion bay westward from the afternoon of august 8 into the afternoon of august 9 hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast mexico from the early afternoon of august 9 into the late afternoon of august 10 hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings between high island texas and freeport texas between the late afternoon of august 9 and the late afternoon of august 10 hurricane watches were dropped for the louisiana coast during the late afternoon of august 9 hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings for the lower texas coast south of freeport

caused just over 1xc2xa0billion (1980 usd) in damages and killed at least 269xc2xa0people throughout its course (including indirect deaths){14]{16]caribbean islands{edit]in barbados preliminary damages were estimated to be 15xc2xa0million (1980 usd) about 500 houses were either damaged or destroyed no deaths were reported st lucia sustained catastrophic damage from the strong categoryxc2xa03 hurricane sustained winds of 90 knots (170xc2xa0kmh) and a sea level pressure as low as 967 millibars (286xc2xa0inhg) were reported at hewanorra{18] eighteen people lost their lives as a result of the storm's passage one death in guadeloupe was attributed to allen{14] in martinique damage was extensive as the storm passed 50 miles (80xc2xa0km) south of the island waves 6 metres (20xc2xa0ft) high battered the coast of the island during the storm{19]in the central caribbean cayman brac was hit by winds in excess of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) which caused considerable property damage a coral reef at discovery bay jamaica was devastated by the wave action from the storm{20] offshore jamaica greater numbers of smaller-sized damselfishes was witnessed in the wake of allen{21] eight deaths in jamaica were attributed to allen damage was very significant along the northeast coast where the hurricane made its closest approach to the island and created a 12 metres (39xc2xa0ft) storm surge three deaths were attributed to allen in cuba{16]extensive damage occurred in haiti due to high winds and flash flooding total costs for that country were estimated to be at more than 400xc2xa0million (1980 usd) roughly 60 of the nation's coffee crop was destroyed in all 220xc2xa0people were killed and 835000 were left homeless in port-au-prince 41 deaths were caused by tin roofs flying off and around 1200 were made homeless by flooding{22] another 140 people were reported dead from flooding{23]mexico{edit]hurricane allen's rainfall across texas and mexicobuilding smashed and knocked off foundation corpus christi texasareas of northeastern mexico saw heavy rains with the passage of allen with the highest totals exceeding 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm){24] the hurricane earlier brushed the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula as allen only affected sparsely populated regions of mexico there were no reports of significant damage{16]united states{edit]storm surge smashed building in corpus christiin texas the storm surge was reported as high as 12 feet (37xc2xa0m) at port mansfield though it may have been higher elsewhere along the texas coast a peak wind gust of 129xc2xa0mph (208xc2xa0kmh) was also measured at port mansfield tropical storm-force winds in corpus christi texas blew roof gravel through the city which led to substantial glass breakage to the 18-story guarantee bank building and a 12-story wing of spohn hospital{25] the storm caused seven deaths in texas and 17 in louisiana (most resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an offshore platform) allen spawned several tornadoes in texas one tornado caused 100xc2xa0million in damage when it hit austin texas making it the costliest tropical cyclone-spawned tornado in recorded history overall however the storm caused limited damage in the united states due to its suddenly diminished power and because its highest tides and winds hit a sparsely-populated portion of the texas coast{16]{26]allen dumped 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) to 20 inches (510xc2xa0mm) of rain in south texas ending a summer-long drought during the heat wave of 1980{27]retirement and records{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the destruction and extreme death tolls the name allen was retired from the atlantic tropic storms list by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 1981 and will not be used for a future atlantic hurricane{28] it was replaced with andrew (which would itself be retired after the 1992 season) in the 1986 season{29]debris from hurricane allenwhen allen reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity on august 5 it became the earliest categoryxc2xa05 storm ever recorded this record stood until hurricane emily surpassed it on july 16 2005 allen is one of three atlantic hurricanes to reach categoryxc2xa05 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions the others being hurricane ivan and hurricane isabel allen also produced the fifth-lowest minimum pressure ever recorded in the atlantic basin at 899 mbar (hpa) and was the strongest known hurricane in the basin in terms of pressure since 1935 until then it was the second strongest hurricane by pressure in the atlantic basin but was since pushed down to fifth and no hurricane has achieved 190 miles per hour (310xc2xa0kmh) winds in this basin since then{30] it remains the most intense storm ever in august allen spent nearly 3xc2xa0days as a categoryxc2xa05 storm initially the longest stretch of any previous atlantic hurricane on record however a reanalysis of the 1932 cuba hurricane showed that it spent 3 hours longer at categoryxc2xa05 intensity than allen{6] and hurricane irma in 2017 also spent slightly more time as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane than allen five typhoons have spent longer as category 5 storms including most recently karen and nancy in the early 1960s{31]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of tropical cycloneslist of atlantic
