he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters{1] he was also willing to do another crossover event if this one received successful ratings{1]much of the episode plot in "hurricane!" was modeled after the action adventure disaster film the poseidon adventure{4]{6] in his interview on the plot of the final part of the crossover episode mike barker a producer for american dad stated that "{they] end up flooding the house and turning it upside down" he continued: "ultimately the house drifts and ends up in the same neighborhood as the griffin and brown homes" the actual crossing over of the event occurs at the end of this episode when stan gets involved in a stand off with cleveland brown of the cleveland show and peter griffin of family guy{6]in april 2011 executives of the fox broadcasting company officially announced that "hurricane!" would air on may 1 as part of the night of the hurricane crossover along with the cleveland show episode "the hurricane!" and family guy episode "seahorse seashell party"{6] however on april 29 it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the southern united states{5]{7]{8]{9]{10]{11] the crossover was subsequently replaced by repeats of "i am the walrus" from american dad! "brian writes a bestseller" from family guy and "ain't nothin' but mutton bustin'" from the cleveland show{7]{11]{12] macfarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of fox and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season{7]guest appearances of "hurricane!"lisa edelstein reprised her role as shari having last done so in the season six episode "best little horror house in langley falls"kristen schaal made her first appearance on american dad!
