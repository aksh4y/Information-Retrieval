120xc2xb0w named by the rsmc nadi however should a tropical depression intensify to the south of 25xc2xb0s between 160xc2xb0e and 120xc2xb0w it will be named in conjunction with rsmc nadi by tcwc wellington should a tropical cyclone move out of the basin and into the australian region it will retain its original name the next 10 names on the naming list are listed here below{5]fehixc2xa0(unused)gitaxc2xa0(unused)holaxc2xa0(unused)irisxc2xa0(unused)joxc2xa0(unused)kalaxc2xa0(unused)liuaxc2xa0(unused)monaxc2xa0(unused)neilxc2xa0(unused)omaxc2xa0(unused)season effects{edit]this table lists all the storms that developed in the south pacific to the east of longitude 160xc2xb0e during the 2017xe2x80x9318 season it includes their intensity on the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale duration name landfalls deaths and damages all data is taken from rsmc nadi andor tcwc wellington and all of the damage figures are in 2017 usdnamedates activepeak classificationsustainedwind speedspressureareas affecteddamage(usd)deathsrefsseason aggregates0xc2xa0systemsnot formed yetnot specifiednot specifiedsee also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of southern hemisphere cyclone seasonsatlantic hurricane seasons: 2017 2018pacific hurricane seasons: 2017 2018pacific typhoon seasons: 2017 2018north indian ocean cyclone seasons: 2017 20182017xe2x80x9318 south-west indian ocean cyclone season2017xe2x80x9318 australian region cyclone seasonreferences{edit]^ a b climate services division (october 26 2010) tropical cyclone guidance for season 201011 for the fiji and the southwest pacific (pdf) (report) fiji meteorological service archived from the original (pdf) on february 27 2012 retrieved october 17 2016xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i j k "2017xe2x80x9318 tropical cyclone season outlook in the regional specialised meteorological centre nadixc2xa0xe2x80x93 tropical cyclone centre (rsmc nadixc2xa0xe2x80x93 tcc) area of responsibility (aor)" (pdf) fiji meteorological service october 11 2017 archived from the original on october 29 2016 retrieved october 11 2017xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i "southwest pacific tropical cyclone outlook -
