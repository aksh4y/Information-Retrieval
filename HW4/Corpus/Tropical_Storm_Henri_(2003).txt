season the eighth storm of the season henri was one of six tropical cyclones to hit the united states in the year henri formed from a tropical wave in the gulf of mexico in early september and crossed over florida as a tropical depression its remnants later moved into the mid-atlantic before dissipating completelyhenri caused little damage as a tropical cyclone in florida it dropped heavy rainfall though damage was limited to minor flooding damage in delaware and pennsylvania damage was greater where heavy rainfall damaged hundreds of houses and businesses the resulting floods in delaware were described as a 1 in 500 year event the total damage by henri along its path amounted to 196xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 215xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) but no deaths were reportedcontents1

according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon august 22 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa and it moved westward across the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea without developing significantly on september 1 the wave axis entered the gulf of mexico and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation the system moved northward and developed into tropical depression twelve on september 3 while located about 300xc2xa0miles (480xc2xa0kilometers) west of tampa florida embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough the depression moved eastward and strengthened into tropical storm henri on september 5{1]remnants of henri making landfall on north carolina on september 12despite strong southwesterly vertical shear henri continued intensifying while moving eastward and reached a peak strength of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) later on september 5 shortly thereafter though the shear greatly weakened the storm and it was downgraded to a tropical depression henri was not able to recover its intensity and made landfall near clearwater florida on september 6 as a 35xc2xa0mph (55xc2xa0kmh) tropical depression and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast{1] despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear{2] henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on september 8 off the coast of north carolina{1]the broad and disorganized remnant low remained nearly stationary due to a ridge of high pressure to its north{1] residual convection within the remnants of henri remained disorganized but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment{3] however it moved inland near cape hatteras on september 12 without reorganizing{4] the remnants continued to the north and dissipated on september 17 over new england{5]preparations{edit]the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning from englewood to indian pass florida while henri was a tropical depression; however warnings were discontinued by the time henri made landfall{1] flood warnings were issued across the state prior to the storm making landfall with predictions of 5 to 10xc2xa0inches (125 xe2x80x93 255xc2xa0mm) of rainfall{6] as a result of the storm's approach twelve shelters were placed on standby similarly the hurricane shelter information hotline was placed on standby and ready to be activated within 10xc2xa0minutes{7] levy county officials declared a state of emergency there sand bags and sand were sent to cedar key yankeetown and inglis in anticipation for storm surge and flooding{8]impact{edit]rainfall from henrihenri dropped heavy rainfall along its path with the worst of the flooding occurring in delaware the storm caused 196xc2xa0million in damage (2003 usd) primarily in delawareflorida bahamas and bermuda{edit]prior to making landfall the storm produced strong waves on the florida west coast{6] following a summer of tropical moisture in florida henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state{9] peaking at 909xc2xa0in (230xc2xa0mm) in hialeah in the southeast portion of the state two other areas experienced over 7xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) though most areas received only light rainfall{5] in hernando county a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5xc2xa0in (125xc2xa0mm) of rain in around an hour it caused a rapid flooding of roads though quickly retreated damage was minor due to lack of many homes in the area{10] a feeder band in charlotte county dropped 7xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) of rain in three hours flooding numerous streets and homes{11] throughout florida damage was minimal and there were no deaths however lightning from a feeder band injured a man in lee county while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to hydroplaning{1]in the bahamas outer rainbands from henri dropped around 1xc2xa0inch (25xc2xa0mm) of rain winds in the archipelago gusted to 32xc2xa0mph (51xc2xa0kmh){12] just days after hurricane fabian struck bermuda moisture from henri brought thunderstorms and heavy rainfall and thunderstorms totaling to 244xc2xa0inches (62xc2xa0mm) at the airport{13] this hindered cleanup efforts though caused no known damage{14]mid-atlantic{edit]in north carolina virginia and maryland rainfall was generally light with the exception of a few areas receiving over 3xc2xa0inches (75xc2xa0mm){5] henri produced greater amounts of rain in delaware and pennsylvania with a peak of 902xc2xa0in (229xc2xa0mm) in hockessin{15] in downingtown pennsylvania over eightxc2xa0inches (203xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in around sixxc2xa0hours while doppler radar estimated that kennett square received over 10xc2xa0inches (255xc2xa0mm) in a five-hour period the heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the red clay creek which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26xc2xa0feet (8xc2xa0m) parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood which has a 02 chance of occurring in any given year{16] numerous rivers in southeastern pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage{17]in delaware the flooding damaged numerous houses including 194 in the glenville area the rapid flooding trapped numerous people in their cars and homes forcing at least one rescue by helicopter those people were evacuated to nearby schools the severe flooding washed out most of a bridge in hockessin{15] and destroyed 6 wilmington  western railroad bridges{18] causing about 5xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 55xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) in damage{19] the railroad bridges were still being rebuilt as of 2006{20] greenbank mill a historic gristmill complex saw 450000 in damage{21] damage in delaware totaled to 161xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 175xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd){15]flash flooding in pennsylvania resulted in 2600xc2xa0emergency 911 calls and around 100xc2xa0rescues for cars or houses the flooding destroyed 12xc2xa0homes and damaged 336 over half of them severely wet soil downed trees and power lines causing power outages to 109000xc2xa0peco energy customers high floodwaters damaged 22xc2xa0bridges and closed 2xc2xa0indefinitely{17] while the flooding closed several roads including a portion of us highway 1 in chadds ford{22] damage in pennsylvania totaled to 35xc2xa0million (2003 usd 38xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd){17] the impacts were severely compounded the following week by hurricane isabel across the regionaftermath{edit]on september 23 just days after the storm moved through president george w bush declared new castle county delaware as a disaster area following the effects of henri and later hurricane isabel the declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing house repairs and serious disaster-related expenses the declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75 of the repair cost for replacing public facilities{23] by two months after the storm 659xc2xa0residents had applied for disaster aid through the federal emergency management agency (fema) totaling to just over 1xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 11xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) 141xc2xa0small businesses applied for loans totaling to around 25xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 275xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) in addition fema received 183xc2xa0applications for public assistance which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings{24] over twentyxc2xa0volunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs one goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local landfills totaling to more than 300xc2xa0tons{25] state and county governments in delaware purchased 171xc2xa0homes following the damage in the glenville area the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage{26] the house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland{27]on september 26 president bush also declared chester county pennsylvania as a disaster area following the damage of henri tropical storm isabel and severe flooding unrelated to either tropical cyclone{28] by a month after the declaration 342xc2xa0homeowners and business owners applied for disaster aid totaling to around 600000 (2003xc2xa0usd 660000 2006xc2xa0usd){29]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms of the same namelist of atlantic hurricanestimeline of the 2003
