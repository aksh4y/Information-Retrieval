b'orbital decay - wikipedia orbital decayfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation search"decaying orbit" redirects here for the 2007 film see decaying orbit (film)in orbital mechanics decay is a process that leads to gradual decrease of the distance between two orbiting bodies at their closest approach (the periapsis) over many orbital periods these orbiting bodies can be a planet and its satellite a star and any object orbiting it or components of any binary system orbits do not decay without some friction-like mechanism which robs energy from the orbital motion this can be any of a number of mechanical gravitational or electromagnetic effects for bodies in a low earth orbit the most significant effect is the atmospheric dragif left unchecked the decay eventually results in termination of the orbit when the smaller object strikes the surface of the primary; or for objects where the primary has an atmosphere the smaller object burns explodes or otherwise breaks up in the larger object's atmosphere; or for objects where the primary is a star ends with incineration by the star's radiation (such as for comets) and so oncollisions and mergers of two stellar-mass objects usually produce cataclysmic effects;{not verified in body] see stellar collision and gamma-ray burstdue to atmospheric drag the lowest altitude above the earth at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150xc2xa0km (90xc2xa0mi)contents1 causes11 atmospheric drag12 tidal effects13 light and thermal radiation14

frequent collisions of gas molecules with the satellite it is the major cause of orbital decay for satellites in low earth orbit it results in the reduction in the altitude of a satellite's orbit for the case of earth atmospheric drag resulting in satellite re-entry can be described by the following sequence:lower altitude xe2x86x92 denser atmosphere xe2x86x92 increased drag xe2x86x92 increased heat xe2x86x92 usually burns on re-entryorbital decay thus involves a positive feedback effect where the more the orbit decays the lower its altitude drops and the lower the altitude the faster the decay decay is also particularly sensitive to external factors of the space environment such as solar activity which are not very predictable during solar maxima the earth's atmosphere causes significant drag up to a hundred kilometers higher than during solar minima{citation needed]atmospheric drag exerts a significant effect at the altitudes of space stations space shuttles and other manned earth-orbit spacecraft and satellites with relatively high "low earth orbits" such as the hubble space telescope space stations typically require a regular altitude boost to counteract orbital decay (see also orbital station-keeping) uncontrolled orbital decay brought down the skylab space station and (relatively) controlled orbital decay was used to de-orbit the mir space station{citation needed]regular orbital boosts are also needed by the hubble space telescope though on a longer time scale due to its much higher altitude however orbital decay is also a limiting factor to the length of time the hubble can go without a maintenance rendezvous the most recent performed successfully by sts-125 with space shuttle atlantis launching may 11 2009 though newer telescopes are in much higher orbits or in some cases in solar orbit so orbital boosting may not be needed{1]tidal effects{edit]this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to

effects when the orbiting body is large enough to raise a significant tidal bulge{clarification needed] on the body it is orbiting and is either in a retrograde orbit or is below the synchronous orbit the resulting tidal interaction saps momentum from the orbiting body and transfers it to the primary's rotation lowering the orbit's altitude until frictional effects come into playexamples of satellites undergoing tidal orbital decay are mars' moon phobos neptune's moon triton and the extrasolar planet tres-3blight and thermal radiation{edit]main articles: poyntingxe2x80x93robertson effect and yarkovsky effectsmall objects in the solar system also experience an orbital decay due to the forces applied by asymmetric radiation pressure ideally energy absorbed would equal blackbody energy emitted at any given point resulting in no net force however the yarkovsky effect is the phenomenon that because absorption and radiation of heat are not instantaneous objects which are not terminally locked absorb sunlight energy on surfaces exposed to the sun but those surfaces do not re-emit much of that energy until after the object has rotated so that the emission is parallel to the object's orbit this results in a very small acceleration parallel to the orbital path yet one which can be significant for small objects over millions of years the poynting-robertson effect is a force opposing the object's velocity caused by asymmetric incidence of light ie aberration of light for an object with prograde rotation these two effects will apply opposing but generally unequal forcesgravitational radiation{edit]main article: two-body problem in general relativitygravitational radiation is another mechanism of orbital decay it is negligible for orbits of planets and planetary satellites but is noticeable for systems of compact objects as seen in observations of neutron star orbitsstellar collision{edit]further information: stellar collisionthe coming together of two binary stars when they lose energy and approach each other several things can cause the loss of energy including tidal forces mass transfer and gravitational radiation the stars describe the path of a spiral as they approach each other this sometimes results in a merger of the two stars or the creation of a black hole the last several revolutions of the stars around each other take only a few seconds in the latter case{2]mass concentration{edit]further information: mass concentration (astronomy)while not a direct cause of orbital decay uneven mass distributions (known as mascons) of the body being orbited can perturb orbits over time and extreme distributions can cause orbits to be highly unstable the resulting unstable orbit can mutate into an orbit where one of the direct causes of orbital decay can take placereferences{edit]^ the hubble program - servicing missions - sm4^ "inspiral gravitational waves" ligo retrieved 1 may 2015xc2xa0orbital decay calculations with discussion
