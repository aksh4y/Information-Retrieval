b'sea spray - wikipedia sea sprayfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchsea spraysea spray refers to aerosol particles that are formed directly from the ocean mostly by ejection into the atmosphere by bursting bubbles at the air-sea interface{1]contents1 composition2 effects3 chemical resistance4 see also5 references6 external linkscomposition{edit]sea salt aerosol (ssa) contains both inorganic salts and organic matter from the ocean{2] it is thought that the amount of organic matter transferred to ssa depends on microbiological activity{3] the organic matter in sea spray can contain dissolved organic matter{4] or even microbes themselves like bacteria and viruses{5]effects{edit]salt spray is largely responsible for corrosion of metallic objects near the coastline as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric oxygen and moisture salts do not dissolve in air directly but are suspended as fine particulates or dissolved in microscopic airborne water dropletschemical resistance{edit]the salt spray test is the notable measure of material endurance particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a mechanical load bearing or otherwise critical role these results are often of great interest to the marine industries whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to the salt water environmentsee also{edit]coastal erosioncloud reflectivity modificationsea airsaltwater intrusionwind wavereferences{edit]^ lewis ernie; schwartz stephen (2004) sea salt aerosol production: mechanisms methods measurements and models washington dc: american geophysical union pxc2xa0413 isbnxc2xa0087590-417-3xc2xa0^ gantt brett; meskhidze nicholas (2013) "the physical and chemical characteristics of marine primary organic aerosol: a review" atmospheric chemistry and physics 13 (8): 3979xe2x80x933996 doi:105194acp-13-3979-2013xc2xa0^ o'dowd cd; facchini mc; cavalli f; ceburnis d; mircea m; decesari s; fuzzi s; yoon yj; putaud jp (2004) "biogenically driven organic contribution to marine aerosol" nature 431 (7009): 676xe2x80x93680 pmidxc2xa015470425 doi:101038nature02959xc2xa0^ russell lm; hawkins ln; frossard aa; quinn pk; bates ts (2010) "carbohydrate-like composition of submicron atmospheric particles and their production from ocean bubble bursting" proc natl acad sci usa 107 (15): 6652xe2x80x936657 pmcxc2xa02872374xe2x80xaf pmidxc2xa020080571 doi:101073pnas0908905107xc2xa0^ blanchard dc; syzdek ld (1972) "concentration of bacteria in jet drops from bursting bubbles" j geophys res 77 (27): 5087 bibcode:1972jgr775087b doi:101029jc077i027p05087xc2xa0external links{edit]wikimedia commons has media related to sea spraythis oceanography article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding itvte retrieved from ""categories: oceanographyoceanography stubshidden categories: all stub articles navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version in other projectswikimedia commons languagescymraegfranxc3xa7aisxedx95x9cxeaxb5xadxecx96xb4xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9eportuguxc3xaas edit links  this page was last edited on 17 april 2017 at 15:29text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
