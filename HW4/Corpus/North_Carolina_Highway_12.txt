to nc 12 on cedar island the byway then continues onto nc 12 north near atlantic the byway then crosses the ocracoke-cedar island ferry north it follows nc 12 north the rest of the way to the intersection of us 64 and nc 12 in nags head where it has its northern terminus the outer banks scenic byway spans approximately 131 miles and takes about 6 hours to drive{3]{4]history{edit]north carolina highway 12 is routed along the outer banks yellow indicates roadbed while blue indicates the ferry routesncxc2xa012 first appeared on the 1924 state highway map running from kinston to ncxc2xa040 south of halifax ncxc2xa012 went from kinston northwest to snow hill where it met up with ncxc2xa0102 from there the road went north to farmville where it met up with ncxc2xa091 from there it continued north to scotland neck passing through tarboro in scotland neck nc 12 turned to the west and ended at ncxc2xa040 south of halifax{5] by 1933 ncxc2xa012 was rerouted to rich square and extended south to usxc2xa017ncxc2xa030; at the same time usxc2xa0258 was routed along of the routing of ncxc2xa012 north of kinston{6] by 1935 ncxc2xa012 was truncated to kinston with usxc2xa0258 getting the routing north of kinston{7] in 1958 the last portion of nc 12 south of kinston was renumbered as nc 58{8]{9] nc 12 shows up on the 1964 map running from ocracoke to whalebone{10] in 1976 nc 12 was extended onto the mainland to connect with us 70{11]{12] in 1987 ncxc2xa012 was extended north of nags head along the virginia dare trail (then business usxc2xa0158){13]{14] ncxc2xa012 was extended further to corolla its present northern terminus a year later{14]{15] a condition of the extension imposed by the north carolina department of transportation is the the road extends no further than corolla{16]hatteras island was cut in two on september 18 2003 by hurricane isabel which opened a new inlet 3000 feet (910xc2xa0m) wide and 30 feet (91xc2xa0m) deep through the community of hatteras village on the southern end of hatteras island this new inlet was temporarily named the isabel inlet after the hurricane road access along ncxc2xa012 was temporarily severed until the island was repaired and restored by sand pumped ashore by the army corps of engineers{citation needed] in 2007 subtropical storm andrea caused high winds to push waves over dunes and onto the highway on hatteras island leaving water a foot deep and sand 2 to 3 feet (091xc2xa0m) deep in some places{17]nc 12 was severed in two places by hurricane irene in late august 2011 the road was breached by two small inlets about 200 feet (61xc2xa0m) across apiece in the pea island national wildlife refuge and north of rodanthe as a result the only way to access hatteras island was by ferry on october 10 2011 a temporary bridge opened over the largest breach the bridge which is 662 feet (202xc2xa0m) long could be in place for more than 10 years while other solutions are thought out{18] as hurricane sandy battered the east coast in october 2012 it has left portions of nc 12 inundated with salt water and sand that forced the closure of the road leaving the remaining people on the outer banks isolated from mainland north carolina{citation needed]in late october 2012 hurricane sandy washed out and damaged a portion of the road at the s-curves north of rodanthe on the pea island national wildlife refuge emergency ferry service was established from rodanthe to stumpy point ferry terminals as in 2011 the ferry service became the lifeline for hatteras island{19] noreasters and storms repeatedly caused breaches since the road was repaired in december 2012 a state of emergency was declared and 208 million of emergency federal funding was secured to construct a more permanent repair{20]rebuilding of dunes and placement of sandbags along a breached section of ncxc2xa012 march 2013junction list{edit]countylocationmi{1]kmdestinationsnotescarteretsea level0000
