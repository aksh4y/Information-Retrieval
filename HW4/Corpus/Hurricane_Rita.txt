most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the gulf of mexico part of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever recorded (along with 1 wilma and 7 katrina) rita was the seventeenth named storm tenth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2005 season rita formed near the bahamas from a tropical wave on septemberxc2xa018 2005 that originally developed off the coast of west africa it moved westward and after passing through the florida straits rita entered an environment of abnormally warm waters moving west-northwest it rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 180xc2xa0mph (285xc2xa0kmh) achieving category 5 status on septemberxc2xa021st however as rita approached land through september 24 it weakened to a category 3 and began to curve to the northwest making landfall in johnson's bayou louisiana between sabine pass texas and holly beach louisiana with winds of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) rapidly weakening over land rita degenerated into a large low-pressure area over the lower mississippi valley by septemberxc2xa026thin louisiana rita's storm surge inundated low-lying communities along the entire coast worsening effects caused by hurricane katrina less than a month prior such as topping the hurriedly-repaired katrina-damaged levees at new orleans parishes in southwest louisiana and counties in southeast texas where rita made landfall suffered from catastrophic-to-severe flooding and wind damage according to an october 25 2005 disaster center report 4526 single-family dwellings were destroyed in orange and jefferson counties located in southeast texas major damage was sustained by 14256 additional single-family dwellings and another 26211 single-family dwellings received minor damage mobile homes and apartments also sustained significant damage or total destruction{1] in all nine texas counties and five louisiana parishes were declared disaster areas after the storm electric service was disrupted in some areas of both texas and louisiana for several weeks texas reported the most deaths from the hurricane where 113xc2xa0deaths were reported 107 of which were associated with the evacuation of the houston metropolitan areamoderate to severe damage was reported across the lower mississippi valley rainfall from the storm and its associated remnants extended from louisiana to michigan rainfall peaked at 1600xc2xa0in (406xc2xa0mm) in central louisiana several tornadoes were also associated with the hurricane and its subsequent remnants throughout the path of rita damage totaled about 12xc2xa0billion (2005xc2xa0usd 156xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) as many as 120xc2xa0deaths in four us states were directly related to the

linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon septemberxc2xa07 2005 a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of africa and moved westward into the atlantic ocean failing to produce organized deep atmospheric convection{2] the disturbance was not monitored by the national hurricane centerxc2xa0(nhc) for tropical cyclogenesis{3] convection associated with the system increased briefly late on septemberxc2xa013 before dissipating shortly thereafter at roughly the same time a remnant surface trough had developed from a dissipating stationary front and began to drift westward north of the lesser antilles{2] meanwhile the tropical wave slowly became better organized and was first noted in the nhc's tropical weather outlooks on septemberxc2xa015 while northeast of puerto rico{4] the wave merged with the surface trough two days later triggering an increase in convective activity and organization a subsequent decrease in wind shear enabled for additional organization and at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa018 the nhc estimated that the storm system had organized enough to be classified as a tropical depression{2] the eighteenth disturbance during the hurricane season to do so at the time the disturbance classified as tropical depression eighteen{5] was roughly 80xc2xa0mi (130xc2xa0km) east of grand turk island in the turks and caicos and had developed banding features{2]{6]in generally favorable conditions for tropical development the depression quickly organized and attained tropical storm strength at 1800xc2xa0utc that day based on data from reconnaissance flights and nearby ships and weather buoys as a result the tropical storm was named rita{2]{7] however an increase in moderate southerly vertical wind shear as the result of a nearby upper-level low subdued continued intensification and displaced convective activity to the north of rita's center of circulation once the upper-level low weakened rita's center of circulation reformed to the north compensating for the disorganization that resulted from the wind shear consequently the tropical storm resumed its previous strengthening trend as it was steered westward across the bahamas along the south periphery of a ridge{2]{8] upon entering the straits of florida on septemberxc2xa020 rita strengthened into a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane by 1200xc2xa0utc{9] while maintaining a minimum barometric pressure of 985xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2909xc2xa0inhg) six hours later rita intensified further into categoryxc2xa02 before subsequently passing approximately 45xc2xa0mi (72xc2xa0km) south of key west florida{2] aided by a favorable outflow pattern and anomalously warm sea surface temperaturesxc2xa0(ssts) the trend of rapid deepening continued{9] and rita reached categoryxc2xa03 status upon entering the gulf of mexico by 0600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa021 making it a major hurricane{2]{8]infrared image of hurricane rita at peak intensity on septemberxc2xa021once in the gulf of mexico rita passed over the extremely warm loop current during the midday hours of septemberxc2xa021 enabling continued strengthening as a result the hurricane's wind field significantly expanded and the storm's barometric pressure quickly fell{2] by 1800xc2xa0utc that day rita attained categoryxc2xa05 hurricane intensity{10] the highest category on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale{11] favorable conditions allowed for additional development and at 0300xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa022 rita reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 180xc2xa0mph (285xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum barometric pressure of 895xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2643xc2xa0inhg) making it the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico at the time it was located 310xc2xa0mi (500xc2xa0km) south of the mississippi river deltarita maintained categoryxc2xa05 hurricane intensity for 18xc2xa0hours before an eyewall replacement cycle took place weakening the hurricane to categoryxc2xa04 intensity by 1800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa022 at the same time the tropical cyclone began to curve northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge of high pressure over the southeastern united states as a result of the cycle a new larger eyewall consolidated resulting in rita's wind field expanding due to wind shear and cooler continental shelf waters the hurricane continued to weaken contrary to typical tropical cyclone processes that occur after eyewall replacement cycles rita weakened to categoryxc2xa03 strength before making landfall at 0740xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa024 in extreme southwestern louisiana between johnson bayou and sabine pass at the time of landfall rita was a categoryxc2xa03xc2xa0hurricane with winds of 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) and a barometric pressure of 937xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2767xc2xa0inhg){2]once inland on septemberxc2xa024 rita began to rapidly weaken{12] the tropical cyclone had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity nearly 12xc2xa0hours after landfall proceeding northward roughly parallel to the state border between louisiana and texas{2] radar imagery indicated that the storm soon lacked winds of tropical storm-force therefore the nhc classified the system as a tropical depression while it was over arkansas by 0600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa025{13] shortly before it turned northeastward ahead of an approaching frontal boundary early the next day the depression lost much of its convection over southeastern illinois and degenerated into a remnant low by 0600xc2xa0utc that day the frontal boundary subsequently absorbed the remaining system six hours later over the southern great lakes region{2]preparations{edit]bahamas{edit]tropical storm rita over the eastern bahamas on septemberxc2xa018at 0300xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa018 a tropical storm warning was issued for the turks and caicos and the southeast and central bahamas at the same time a hurricane watch was also issued for the northwest bahamas by 0600xc2xa0utc the following day the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwest bahamas excluding grand bahama and the abaco islands which were later put under a tropical storm warning several hours later a hurricane warning was issued for exuma and andros island at 1800xc2xa0utc the tropical storm warning for the turks and caicos was discontinued as the threat from rita diminished this discontinuation later included the southeast bahamas by 1500xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa020 all watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued as rita moved into the gulf of mexico{2] residents in the bahamas were urged to board up their homes and stock up on emergency supplies{14] at least one shelter was opened and schools throughout the country were closed{15] the nassau international airport was also closed due to the storm on septemberxc2xa019 and would remain closed until the evening of septemberxc2xa020{16]cuba{edit]officials in cuba warned residents of possible impacts from rita and closed public facilities in northern areas some evacuations took place in villages near the northern coastline and several shelters were opened{17] an estimated 150000 people were evacuated in northern cuba ahead of the storm about 600 shelters were opened in havana which could house a total of 120000 people in western cuba more than 42000 were given shelter in matanzas 31000 in villa claro and 6300 in sancti spiritus{18] in havana power was turned off at noon on septemberxc2xa019 to protect transformers this also led to the disruption of natural gas lines{19] a large-scale preparation was put in place by the ministry of health in cuba a total of 14859 medical personnel were mobilized to quickly assist residents impacted by rita the personnel consisted of 3767 doctors 5143 nurses 2139 specialists 1072 health officials and 2738 other staff members a total of 519 vehicles were also mobilized; it included 241 ambulances 36 trucks 21 panels and 221 other vehicles throughout northern cuba a total of 1486 shelters were opened most of which were filled during the evacuation{20]florida{edit]hurricane rita as a category 2 hurricane crossing the florida straitson septemberxc2xa018 when rita was declared a tropical storm phased evacuations began in the florida keys all tourists were told to evacuate the lower keys immediately and residents in mobile homes were told to prepare to evacuate{21] by septemberxc2xa020 mandatory evacuations were in place for the 80000 residents of the keys both lanes on route 1 were directed northbound to speed up evacuations city busses picked up those who did not have transportation out of the keys an estimated 23xc2xa0million people in miami-dade county were warned about the possibility of a direct hit on miami and told to prepare to evacuate{22] a state of emergency was declared ahead of rita later that day by president george w bush this would allow federal assistance to aid the affected areas in the wake of the storm{23] throughout florida a total of 340000 people were placed under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders{24]five shelters were opened in southern florida with a total capacity of 4335 people tolls on northbound roads were lifted in monroe county a total of four hospitals three assisted living facilities and two nursing homes were evacuated military support in the form of 7000 soldiers eight black hawk helicopters two chinook helicopters three kiowa helicopters one huron aircraft one short 360 aircraft one hercules aircraft and one metroliner aircraft was provided a task force was put on standby in homestead joint air reserve base to quickly deploy in affected areas{25]the united states department of agriculture prepared food to deliver to affected areas after rita the united states department of defense deployed personnel to coordinate evacuations the united states department of health and human services sent fully equipped medical teams and supplies if needed the united states department of homeland security pre-positioned over 100 trucks of ice and packed food to deliver following rita two helicopters and one cheyenne aircraft were also provided to assist with recovery efforts the united states department of the interior shut down all national parks in florida and evacuated workers in low-lying areas{26] military cargo planes evacuated hospital patients from three acute-care hospitals in the keys{27]louisiana{edit]on tuesday sept 20th louisiana governor kathleen blanco issued a state of emergency for all parishes in the southwestern region of louisiana and requested in writing of president george w bush that he issue a federal state of emergency for the entire state refugees still at the new orleans convention center and superdome were being evacuated as a precaution and national guard troops and other emergency personnel in for the hurricane katrina aftermath were being mobilized to evacuate{28] select military personnel stayed in new orleans for hurricane rita including task force california (2-185 armor and 1-184 infantry){29] {30]by the morning of wednesday sept 21st as rita's strength course and speed became clearer officials of cameron parish calcasieu parish and parts of jefferson davis parish acadia parish iberia parish beauregard parish and vermillion parish began to strongly encourage residents to evacuate ahead of the storm with a 6:00 pm thursday deadline set most residents followed the recommendations of their respective officials hitting the road by the deadline though many returned home and waited until early the next morning after encountering severe traffic delays southern cameron parish residents used to frequent evacuations were gone by noon on thursday; when parish officials returned to the hwy 27 "gibbstown bridge" that crosses the intracoastal canal into lower cameron parish two days later in preparation of damage inspection and rescue of any stranded andor injured residents no one was known to have remained{29]texas{edit]motorists stranded on highway 60 during hurricane rita evacuationtexas governor rick perry recalled all emergency personnel including almost 1200 texas national guard 1100 texas state guard and several hundred texas game wardens from katrina recovery efforts in anticipation of hurricane rita's arrival in addition the federal government deployed 11 disaster medical assistance teams (dmats){31] staging them in mobile field hospitals across eastern texas the teams treated 7500 patients during the response{32]{33] on september 22 governor perry and the texas department of transportation implemented a contraflow lane reversal on interstate 45 north towards dallas on interstate 10 west towards san antonio us highway 290 northwest to austin{34]as part of the evacuation johnson space center in houston handed off control of the international space station to their russian counterparts{35]concerns had been raised over the state of the oil industry in response to rita the storm threatened a large amount of oil infrastructure that was left undamaged by katrina{36] the texas gulf coast is home to 23 of the united states' refining capacity and numerous offshore production platforms were in rita's path{37] a direct strike on houston could disable more than a quarter of the united states' fuel-making capacity{38] valero energy corp the nation's largest refiner stated on september 21 that rita could have caused gasoline prices to rise well above 3 per us gallon (079l) at a time when the us average price was 277gal{39]mass evacuation{edit]just three weeks after hurricane katrina devastated the northern gulf coast the threat of yet another major hurricane prompted mass evacuations in coastal texas an estimated 25xc2xa0xe2x80x93 37xc2xa0million people fled prior to rita's landfall{40]{41] making it one of the largest evacuations in united states' history{2]officials in galveston county (which includes the city of galveston) which was devastated by the galveston hurricane of 1900 ordered mandatory evacuations effective september 21 at 6 pm in a staggered sequence officials designated geographical zones in the area to facilitate an orderly evacuation people were scheduled to leave at different times over a 24-hour period depending on the zone in which the people were located the scheduled times were set well in advance of the storm's possible landfall later in the week but not soon enough to ensure that all residents could evacuate safely in advance of the storm{42] nonetheless many residents remained in the county because they were either unaware of the danger of the storm or believed that it was more important to protect their belongings particularly in the wake of looting following hurricane katrina{43] the evacuation included transfer of all inpatients from the university of texas medical branch hospital to other regional hospitals{44] 400 patients were prisoners under the ward of the texas department of criminal justice{45] these patients were systematically transferred to the university of texas health center at tyler{46]officials of harris county hoped that the designation of zones a b and c would help prevent bottlenecks in traffic leaving the area similar to those seen at new orleans prior to katrina and hurricane dennis earlier that year{47] also people in certain zones were to be forced to go to certain cities in texas and were not allowed to exit their designated routes except for food and gasxc2xa0xe2x80x94 another feature of the evacuation plan which officials hoped would keep traffic flow orderlythe evacuation-destination cities included austin college station san antonio dallas huntsville and lufkin texas evacuees were asked to try hotels in the midlandodessa area when hotels began to sell out in other areas{48]on wednesday houston mayor bill white urged residents to evacuate the city telling residents "don't wait; the time for waiting is over" reminding residents of the disaster in new orleans{49] after heavy traffic snarled roads leading out of town and gas shortages left numerous vehicles stranded mayor white backed off his earlier statement with "if you're not in the evacuation zone follow the news" advising people to use common sense{49] however by 3:00xc2xa0pm that afternoon the freeway system in houston was at a stand-still{50]to the east of houston officials had set up evacuation routes in response to the slow evacuation of residents prior to hurricane lili{51] during the rita evacuation these preparations and their execution were overwhelmed by the enormous and unprecedented number of people fleeing from the houston area prior to the departure of local residents{42] by the time jefferson county began their mandatory evacuation local roads were already full of houstonians{52] traffic on designated evacuation routes was forced to go far slower than the speeds experienced with any previous hurricane{53]{54]by late thursday (22nd) morning the contraflow lanes had been ordered opened after officials determined that the state's highway system had become gridlocked{55] the texas department of transportation was unprepared to execute such a large-scale evacuation{56] coordination and implementation of the contraflow plan took 8 to 10 hours as inbound traffic was forced to exit police were stationed to assist with traffic flow evacuees fought traffic wednesday afternoon through mid-day friday moving only a fraction of the normal distance expected{42] average travel times to dallas were 24xe2x80x9336 hours travel times to austin were 12xe2x80x9318 hours and travel times to san antonio were 10xe2x80x9316 hours depending on the point of departure in houston{57] many motorists ran out of gas or experienced breakdowns in temperatures that neared 100xc2xa0xc2xb0f (38xc2xa0xc2xb0c) traffic volumes did not ease for nearly 48 hours as more than three million residents evacuated the area in advance of the storm{42]evacuation deaths{edit]as an estimated 25xc2xa0xe2x80x93 37xc2xa0million people evacuated the texas coastline a significant heat wave affected the region the combination of severe gridlock and excessive heat led to between 90 and 118 deaths even before the storm arrived{40]{41] reports from the houston chronicle indicated 107 evacuation-related fatalities texas representative garnet coleman criticized the downplay of the deaths in the evacuation and questioned whether the storm would be deadlier than the preparations{58] according to local officials the traffic reached a point where residents felt safer riding out the storm at home rather than being stuck in traffic when rita struck{40] many evacuees periodically turned off their air conditioning to reduce fuel consumption as well as drank less water to limit the number of "restroom stops" according to a post-storm study which reported 90 evacuation-related deaths nine people perished solely as a result of hyperthermia however it was suspected that most of the 67 deaths attributed to heat stress were a combination of hyperthermia and chronic health conditions{41] in addition to the heat-related deaths 23 nursing home evacuees were killed after a bus caught fire on interstate 45 near wilmer{41] the bus erupted into flames after the vehicle's rear axle overheated due to insufficient lubrication and ignited therapeutic oxygen tanks on board{59] according to a resident near the site of the accident there were three explosions{60] many of the passengers were mobility-impaired making escape difficult or impossible{61] in june 2009 nearly four years after the fire families of those who died in the accident won an 80xc2xa0million settlement against the manufacturer of the bus and the company that provided the nursing home with it{59]impact{edit]see also: hurricane rita tornado outbreakhurricane rita rainfallin some areas the effects of hurricane rita were not nearly as severe as anticipated the storm surge feared in galveston and houston struck farther east as the storm's center came ashore at the louisiana border winds blowing offshore in texas actually flattened the surge which was only 7 feet (21xc2xa0m) in galveston well below the height of the seawall the 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm) of rain expected to fall overnight in new orleans as rita came ashore also did not happen and the pressure on the levee system was eased still a storm surge of up to 18 feet (55xc2xa0m) struck southwestern louisiana and coastal parishes experienced extensive damage in cameron parish the communities of holly beach hackberry cameron creole and grand chenier were essentially destroyed{62] there were also severe impacts mainly due to wind in inland parishes and counties across southwest louisiana and southeast texas respectively cities such as beaumont texas and lake charles louisiana as well as surrounding communities suffered extensive wind damagean estimated two million people lost electricity{63] total damage is estimated at approximately 12xc2xa0billion making rita the tenth-costliest storm in us history{2]deaths{edit]statestate

the direct effects of the winds flooding tornadoes storm surge or oceanic effects of rita indirect deaths are caused by hurricane-related accidents (including car accidents crimes fires or other incidents) cleanup and evacuation incidents and health issues (such as poisoning illnesses lack of emergency aid)caribbean{edit]as rita developed near the turks and caicos islands it dropped up to 5xc2xa0in (130xc2xa0mm) of rain but caused little damage throughout the bahamas swells produced by rita reached 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) and storm surge was estimated at 3 to 5xc2xa0ft (091 to 152xc2xa0m){76] strong winds were reported across the islands but no damage resulted from the storm{77]in cuba rita produced winds up to 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) and more than 5xc2xa0in (127xc2xa0mm) of rain in some areas this resulted in significant structural damage but no loss of life{19]{78] in the bay shore area of havana water levels rose and inundated 20 blocks of the city{19] an estimated 400000 people in the city lost power a result of the storm{79] in a two-hour span more than 82 inches (210xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in bauta{80] the torrential rains led to 34 homes collapsing in havana storm surge produced by rita penetrated an estimated 330xc2xa0ft (100xc2xa0m) inland flooding several towns{79]florida{edit]rita produced moderate rains across southern florida peaking at 513 inches (130xc2xa0mm) in tenraw{2] a band of rain estimated to be 20xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) wide produced heavier rain with doppler radar estimating some totals over 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm){81] most of the florida keys received 3xc2xa0in (762xc2xa0mm) of rain or more the highest sustained winds were recorded at 20:32xc2xa0utc (3:32xc2xa0pm edt) on septemberxc2xa020 in key west at 62xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) gusts in key west were recorded at 76xc2xa0mph (122xc2xa0kmh) a maximum storm surge of 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) was recorded{2] which flooded at least 200 homes throughout four blocks in key west{82] floodwaters up to 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) deep reached the runways at key west international airport{2] a storm surge of 15xc2xa0ft (046xc2xa0m) was recorded in miami although no flooding was reported minor erosion also occurred on south-facing beaches at the height of the storm an estimated 126000 people were without power{81] one funnel cloud was reported along interstate 95 in lake worth winds were estimated at 30xe2x80x9340xc2xa0mph (48xe2x80x9364xc2xa0kmh){83] high seas from rita on septemberxc2xa022 flooded parts of coastal walton county moderate beach erosion also occurred as a result of the high seas damages from the flooding estimated at 200000{84] damages in southern florida were minimal{2] on septemberxc2xa024 strong rip currents produced by the remnants of rita resulted in the death of one person near miramar beach{85]louisiana{edit]holly beach a town along the gulf coast completely destroyed by ritawith an estimated cost of 8xc2xa0billion in damages hurricane rita's impact across louisiana varied one person is known to have drowned during the event{2]{86] due to the hurricane's storm surge which topped levees and inundated low-lying coastal communities the greatest amount of damage extended across most of southern louisiana from the mississippi river delta to the sabine river widespread power outages affected roughly 1xc2xa0million customers with entergy louisiana reporting the largest outage of 601183 customers losing power{87]in southeast louisiana's terrebonne parish storm surge reached 7xc2xa0ft (21xc2xa0m) flooding an estimated 10000 homes virtually every levee was breached{88] some people were stranded in flooded communities and had to be rescued by boat at least 100 people were reported rescued from rooftops{89] already devastated by hurricane katrina the industrial canal in new orleans was again flooded by hurricane rita as the recently-and-hurriedly-repaired levees were breached once morein south-central vermilion parish storm surge reached all the way up to the communities of abbeville gueydan and lake arthur the 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) surge completely flooded pecan island intracoastal city and delcambre{86] nearly all of the structures on pecan island were destroyed{2] rescue efforts were undertaken for up to 1000 people stranded by local flooding on saturday september 24 alone 250 people were rescued{90]however the southwestern region of the state near where rita made landfall was undeniably the worst impacted region in louisiana{2]in cameron parish the damage was catastrophic particularly along the coastline and north to the intracoastal waterway coastal storm surge was estimated around 18xc2xa0ft (55xc2xa0m) with lower levels farther inland from the coast yet much of north-western and north-central cameron parish experienced significant flooding the southern cameron parish communities of cameron creole grand chenier holly beach johnson bayou little chenier and oak grove were either heavily devastated or entirely wiped out by the storm surge with nearly 95 percent of homes businesses and infrastructure completely destroyed closer to the intracoastal waterway communities shared a similar fate; big lake deatonville gibbstown and hackberry were all devastated or heavily damaged in hackberry an unofficial wind gust of 180xc2xa0mph was recorded on a boat tied up to a local dock above the intracoastal waterway in northern cameron parish damage was devastating with the communities of grand lake hebert's camp lowry pelican point and sweetlake suffering from extensive flooding and wind damage over a decade later many communities south of the intracoastal waterway are still recovering with their populations significantly lower than pre-rita levelsto the north in calcasieu parish the cities and communities of iowa lake charles moss bluff sulphur and westlake suffered severe wind damage and some areas also received flooding due to both storm surge and heavy rain in lake charles the storm surge that traveled up the calcasieu ship channel from the coast was estimated to be up to 8xc2xa0ft (24xc2xa0m) a casino boat secured at the north end of the lake and several barges secured at the port of lake charles broke free from their moorings floating loose until running into the interstate 10 bridge over the calcasieu river causing minor damage other areas of lake charles also experienced severe flooding with reports of water rising 6xe2x80x938xc2xa0feet at one point inundating the lower floors of the lake charles civic center at a hotel on a section of the contraband bayou near interstate 210 and prien lake road water reportedly rose as high as the second floor there was extensive minor-to-major structural wind damage across the entire area including the near-devastation of the lake charles regional airport south of the city{91] damage to the entire region's electrical and communications infrastructure was severe and authorities warned returning residents that restoration of services to some areas would take weeks to monthsholly beach was almost completely leveled by rita's storm surgein the western calcasieu parish communities of vinton and starks wind damage was also severe the roof was torn off of the vinton recreation center and many homes were damaged by fallen trees and utility poles damaged utility towers made power restoration problematic with much of the area waiting months for utilities to be restoredallen beauregard jeff davis and vernon parishes suffered lesser yet still significant degrees of wind damage and flooding damage due to heavy rainafter weakening to a tropical storm rita entered desoto and caddo parishes the center passed just west of downtown shreveport before crossing the

than the lowest pressure on record of 2904xc2xa0inches back on february 27 1902{92]mississippi{edit]in mississippi rita produced widespread rainfall upon its landfall in louisiana;{93] however most of the rain fell early on septemberxc2xa025 as a band of heavy rain developed over parts of western mississippi northeast louisiana and southern arkansas resulting in up to 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) of rain around the big black river{94] in the span of a few hours{95] the heavy rainfall caused significant flooding in yazoo and warren counties in yazoo numerous homes had water inside and countywide damage amounted to 6xc2xa0million{96] damage in warren county was less than yazoo amounting to 27xc2xa0million{97] holmes hinds and madison counties also had flooding with damage in all three counties amounting to 2xc2xa0million{98]{99]{100] several roads were also flooded in monroe county after 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rain fell{101] winds up to 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) downed numerous trees throughout the state{102] in adams county winds caused several trees to fall on homes in natchez leaving 270000 in damage{103] in warren county a mobile home was destroyed after a tree was downed by high winds{104]an unusually large amount of tornadoes touched down in the state due to rita with 54 confirmed in mississippi alone the size of the tornado outbreak ranked it as the largest recorded by the national weather service office in jackson{94] an f1 tornado killed one person after tossing a mobile home into the air and destroying it two other occupants sustained serious injuries{105] damage from tornadoes alone in the state amounted to 145xc2xa0million{102] six f2 tornadoes touched down in mississippi{102] one of these tracked for nearly 18 miles (29xc2xa0km) and grew to a width of 800xc2xa0yd (730xc2xa0m) the tornado caused 25xc2xa0million in damage and injured three people after destroying one building and severely damaging several homes and farms{106] another f1 tornado struck a mobile home park destroying eleven homes injuring seven people and leaving 2xc2xa0million in damages{107] throughout the state 2127 residences lost power due to high winds{87]texas{edit]this

how and when to remove this template message)two satellite images showing the extent of flooding caused by rita in louisiana and texasthe impact of rita limited to southeast and east texas varied with both wind and storm-surge damage impacting communities in various ways hurricane-force winds extended over 100 miles (160xc2xa0km) inland across eastern texas causing extensive damage to trees in the piney woods communities near and along the west side of the sabine river from the gulf coast up to toledo bend reservoir saw the greatest measure of damage the worst damage in the state occurred in several counties in southeast texas including jefferson orange hardin jasper newton and tyler counties where damage to electrical and communication services was severe power was not restored in some areas across the region for weeks to even months cities in the "golden triangle" formed by beaumont port arthur and orange tx sustained extensive wind damage whether directly from wind or collaterally from wind-fallen trees tree branches andor other detritus in beaumont an estimated 25 of the trees in neighborhoods across the city were uprooted or heavily damaged and in groves (home of "the texas pecan festival") about the same percentage of pecan trees suffered similar fates the water treatment plant in port neches was heavily damaged governor rick perry declared a nine-county disaster area as a result of the significant damage in those communitiesin galveston texas parts of the coast not protected by the sea wall experienced minor storm-surge flooding distressingly at the height of rita's landfall a fire broke out in the strand historic district; fortunately the galveston fire department reacted quickly and was able to contain and douse the wind-whipped blaze limiting damage and preventing the fire from spreading throughout the city luckily no serious injuries were reported though several historic buildings were either gutted or damaged; a fire-weakened wall of the vacated yaga's cafe and bar collapsed several hours later likely due to lingering wind gusts{108]floodwaters and destruction left in the aftermath of hurricane rita in an area located near galveston bay texasfor the most part houston escaped major damage apart from extensive power interruptions a few windows blew out of some downtown skyscrapers and some trees and traffic signals were downed or damaged{109] thirty-one deaths in harris county were attributed to rita mostly related to the evacuation and cleanup{110]church in beaumont with roof ripped off by hurricane ritanorth of houston the 25-mile-wide (40xc2xa0km) lake livingston dam sustained substantial damage from powerful waves driven by wind gusts of up to 117xc2xa0mph (188xc2xa0kmh){111] and officials started an emergency release of water to lessen pressure on the dam a number of news outlets reported on sunday september 25 2005 that the discharge put lives at risk downstream and threatened a major bridge repairs to the dam were expected to take months to complete{112] after water levels were lowered and an inspection was conducted by national and local experts the dam was declared stable late on monday september 26 2005{113]rita's landfall in extreme southwest louisiana spared southeast and east texas far greater damage from storm surge in particular texas's coastal communities around galveston bay located to the west of where the storm came ashore were largely protected from rita's storm surge by her fortuitous path however sabine pass experienced a significant storm surge which destroyed much of the community the town was featured on an episode of extreme makeover: home edition which built a new fire station in the community the new fire station was later destroyed in hurricane ike which struck the texas coast in 2008prudently a mandatory evacuation of southeast texas had been issued before rita's landfall by both local and state governments as a result of governor perry's disaster declaration many residents displaced by andor returning home to the aftermath of rita were able to take advantage of up to 60xc2xa0days of hotel rooms generators chainsaws and monetary assistance by femaelsewhere{edit]as hurricane rita passed to the south of florida on septemberxc2xa020{2] outer bands to the north produced minor rainfall in parts of southern georgia peaking near 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm){93] in alabama the storm produced 22 weak tornadoes mainly rated f0 causing minor isolated damage amounting to roughly 12xc2xa0million{102] heavy rains also fell in association with rita in the state most of the western portions of alabama received more than 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) with south-central portions peaking around 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm){93] the remnants of rita had little impact in tennessee only consisting of moderate rainfall peaking near 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm){93] up to 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in southeastern missouri southern illinois western kentucky most of indiana east and northern ohio and southern michigan before the storm merged with a frontal system on septemberxc2xa026{93]the weakened remnants of hurricane rita produced heavy rainfall and several tornadoes on septemberxc2xa024 in arkansas{102] most of the state received at least 1 inch (25xc2xa0mm) of rain with maximum amounts around 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm){93] three f2 tornadoes touched down in the state the first injured five people in lonoke county{114] the second was a low-end f2 tornado that completely destroyed a double-wide mobile home{115] the third was rated as a high-end f2 with winds near 155xc2xa0mph (249xc2xa0kmh); it destroyed three structures and severely damaged several others{116] throughout the state winds gusted up to 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh){117] leaving 2976 residences without power{87] damage in arkansas amounted to roughly 1xc2xa0million{117]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesretirement{edit]resulting from heavy destruction on the gulf coast the name rita was retired in the spring of 2006 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced by rina for the 2011 atlantic hurricane season's list{118]economic effects{edit]projected path of hurricane rita on septemberxc2xa022 highlighting refineries and oil rigs across southeast texas and southern louisianathe heavy concentration of oil infrastructure in the gulf of mexico makes hurricanes of rita's intensity very problematic currently very little spare crude oil capacity exists in the united states and the gulf of mexico produces some 2 million barrels (320000xc2xa0m3) per day total as well as having some 30 of the total refining capacity of the united states rita's path traveled through a dense area of offshore pipelines and oil platforms and on land to an area with large refineries with over half of gulf production still shut down in the wake of katrina some economists have stated that a worst-case scenario is for gasoline prices to briefly touch 5us gallon (130l) which would be easily the highest real price for gasoline paid in the united states during the internal combustion era however the oil industry escaped essentially unscathed from the storm and post-storm predictions estimated only minor price rises with some 200000 jobless claims attributed to katrina rita may have been a further drag on a weakened us economy{citation needed]the most pessimistic projections had gdp growth cut by 1 on an annualized basis in the united states in the second half of 2005 with as many as 500000 people made unemployed some economists argued that the rebuilding effort could buoy the economy in 2006 while others argued that the energy spike could decrease consumer confidence by enough to send the economy into a full-fledged recession when combined with the federal reserve's recent increases in interest rates while the above did happen it did not occur until 2008 nearly three years after rita's impact{citation needed]due to the impending oil shortage and increasing gas prices georgia governor sonny perdue declared what he termed "snow days" closing all georgia public primary and secondary schools on september 26 and 27 to conserve fuel for buses{citation needed]the combined effect of hurricanes katrina and rita was the destruction of an estimated 562 square kilometres (217xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) of coastal wetlands in louisiana{119]military relief operations{edit]soldiers load hundreds of meals ready-to-eat and water onto a ch-47 chinook helicopter at ellington field

joined by engineers and military police from louisiana the 56th stryker brigade from pennsylvania{121] and an engineering battalion from missouri it is their mission to provide relief support for all of the areas in texas and louisiana affected by the two storms and to remove obstructions that might otherwise hinder help to those affectedamerican red cross operations{edit]the american red cross continued to provide disaster relief to hurricane katrina affected areas but as a result of hurricane rita had to open additional shelters in other gulf states the red cross also expanded their hurricane katrina internet "safe list" for use by those affected by hurricane ritaamericorps relief operations{edit]americorps sent several crews to texas mississippi and louisiana in response to hurricane katrina and hurricane rita the crews originated from two main organizations the national civilian community corps (nccc) and the washington conservation corps (wcc) as well as from smaller americorps organizations such as americorps st louis' emergency response team (ert) the crews performed a number of relief tasks for hurricane survivors including support on the federal emergency management agency (fema)carnival cruise lines shelter ship tarping damaged roofs and debris removal as of the beginning of 2006 americorps teams have been involved in the rebuilding efforts in louisiana and mississippi teams have also operated volunteer camps like camp premier as well as assisted with the made with love cafe as of may 2006 americorps reported that it would continue to send
