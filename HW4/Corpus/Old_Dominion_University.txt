university began in the minds of administrators and officials at the college of william and mary in the first decades of the twentieth century notable among these men were robert m hughes a wm board of visitors member from 1893xe2x80x931917 and jac chandler the 18th president of that school{7]{8] in 1924 after becoming the director of the william and mary extension in norfolk joseph healy began organizing classes and finding locations for faculty and staff he along with the collective efforts of robert m hughes dr jac chandler and ah foreman a two-year branch division was established on march 13 1930{7]{9] on september 12 1930 the norfolk division of the college of william and mary held their first class with 206 students (125 men and 81 women) in the old larchmont school building which was an abandoned elementary school on hampton boulevard on september 3 1930 h edgar timmerman becomes the division's first director{10]original sign from the norfolk division"the division" as it was affectionately called which started out in the old larchmont school building and allowed people with less means to attend a school of higher education for two years{7] tuition for the first year was 50 usd{7] the following september virginia polytechnic institute more commonly known as virginia tech began offering classes at "the division" expanding the number of courses taught{7] old dominion began educating teachers and engineers created in the first year of the great depression the college benefited from federal funding as part of president franklin d roosevelt's new deal{7] the public works administration provided funds for the administration building now rollins hall and foreman field named after ah foreman an early proponent of the college{7] lewis warrington webb first joined the faculty in 1932 as an instructor of engineering and would later be called "the father of old dominion" after serving 10 years as an instructor at the norfolk division of the college of william and mary he was appointed assistant director in 1942 he also served as director of the defense and war training program at the college from 1940-1944 through its defense and training classes the norfolk division makes an invaluable contribution to the war effort the program also allows the school to remain open during a period when most young men were serving their country the program attracts many women who learn aircraft repair drafting and other war-related subjects in 1946 webb was appointed director of the norfolk division dr webb's dream was to see the norfolk division become an independent institution the two-year norfolk division rapidly evolved into a four-year institution and he saw that dream fulfilled in 1962 when the norfolk division gained its independence from william and mary on february 16 1962 the william and mary system was dissolved under general assembly legislation which was signed by gov albertis s harrison later that year the norfolk division was renamed to the old dominion college{9] dr webb served as the first president of old dominion college from 1962-1969 frank batten who was the publisher of the virginian-pilot and the ledger-star and member of the norfolk division's advisory board was chosen as the first rector of old dominion college on may 27 1962 he held the position of rector until 1970 and the college of engineering was named in his honor in 2004 in 1964 the first students lived on campus in the first dormitories rodgers and gresham hall which were names after members of the advisory board in 1969 old dominion college transitioned to old dominion university under the leadership of president james l bugg jr during bugg's tenure the first doctoral programs were established along with a university-wide governance structure in which faculty administrators and students were represented bugg also re-established the army rotc program that was originally created in 1948 but was abandoned because of the outbreak of the korean war{11]{12]old larchmont school building were the first classes were heldin the 1970s during the tenure of president alfred b rollins jr old dominion began mutual partnerships between

hampton roads area under rollins the university expanded its state and private funding improved student services and introduced an honors program along with many other improvements to the university in 1971 the university established its own campus police force and hired several police officers to patrol the campus 1977 the virginia campus police act was made into a law the university helped train local and campus police officers and the campus police officers were given full police authority on and around the campus grounds{13]from these humble beginnings the college grew southward along hampton boulevard turning an empty field into a sprawling campus after completion at the norfolk division students would move on to schools offering degrees or would seek careers locally "the division" began by educating teachers and engineers in 1962 it became an autonomous four-year college under the name old dominion college considerable growth in enrollment the expansion of research facilities and preparation for the addition of graduate programs led the board to seek and receive university status in 1969{7] since this time the university has continued to grow and now has an

many new football programs all players on the 2008 monarchs football team were redshirted and when added with the 2009 signing class and transfers from i-a schools formed the nucleus of the school's first football team initially odu competed as an fcs program (formerly i-aa) and was independent for two years before joining the colonial athletic association for the 2011 seasonthe final record for old dominion's 2009 football program was 9-2 at the time the best winning record ever for a first-year collegiate football program this record is now held by mercer university who finished 10-2 in 2013{58] old dominion's football program had continued success in 2010 finishing 8-3 in the following years old dominion's football program finished their 2011-2012 season with a 10-3 record and an 11-2 record for their 2012-2013 season which gained national attention as the school's football program began to grow along with the university itself old dominion's potential was realized by several commissioners for college football particularly by conference usa old dominion officially joined conference usa (c-usa) on july 1 2013 leaving behind their former conference affiliation with the colonial athletic association (caa){59] they won their first c-usa game against rice owls on september 20 2014{60]foreman field formerly the field hockey and women's lacrosse teams' home venue has

their first year at varsity level the women's team placed at a national competition the decision to elevate only the women's team to varsity status was made to keep odu compliant with title ix
