approved maryland purple line (light rail) which will be operationally separate from metrothe washington metro known colloquially as metro and branded metrorail{4] is the heavy rail rapid transit system serving the washington metropolitan area in the united states it is administered by the washington metropolitan area transit authority (wmata) which also operates metrobus service under the metro name{5] besides the district of columbia metro serves several jurisdictions in the states of maryland and virginia in maryland metro provides service to montgomery and prince george's counties; in virginia to arlington and fairfax counties and the independent city of alexandria combined with its ridership in the independent virginia cities of falls church and fairfax the metro service area is largely coextensive with the inner ring of the washington metropolitan area the system is currently being expanded to reach dulles international airport and loudoun county virginia it operates mostly as a subway in the district itself while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevatedopened in 1976 the network now includes six lines 91 stations and 117 miles (188xc2xa0km) of route{6]{7] due to subway track depths metro's wheaton station has the longest single-tier escalator in the western hemisphere spanning 230 feet (70xc2xa0m){8]metro is the third-busiest rapid transit system in the united states in number of passenger trips after the new york city subway and chicago "l"{1] there were 2153 million trips on metro in fiscal year 2015 or 712843 trips per weekday{9] in june 2008 metro set a monthly ridership record with 19729641 trips or 798456 per weekday{10] fares vary based on the distance traveled the time of day and the type of card used by the passenger riders

national capital planning commission thought that a rail transit system would never be self-sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline{11] but the plan met fierce opposition and was altered to include a capital beltway system plus rail line radials the beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious inner loop freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the metro system{12]in 1960 the federal government created the national capital transportation agency to develop a rapid rail system in 1966 a bill creating wmata was passed by the federal government the district of columbia virginia and maryland{6] with planning power for the system being transferred to it from the ncta{13]interior of a rehabilitated breda carwmata approved plans for a 98-mile (158xc2xa0km) regional system in 1968{13] construction began after a groundbreaking ceremony on december 9 1969 when secretary of transportation john a volpe district mayor walter washington and maryland governor marvin mandel tossed the first spade of dirt at judiciary square{14] the first portion of the system opened march 27 1976 with 46 miles (74xc2xa0km) available on the red line with five stations from rhode island avenue to farragut north all in the district of columbia{15] arlington county virginia was linked to the system on july 1 1977;{16] montgomery county maryland on february 6 1978;{17] prince george's county maryland on november 20 1978;{18] and fairfax county virginia and alexandria virginia on december 17 1983{6]{19] underground stations were built with cathedral-like arches of concrete highlighted by soft indirect lighting{20] the name metro was suggested by massimo vignelli who designed the subway maps for the new york city subway{21]the 103-mile (166xc2xa0km) 83-station system was completed with the opening of the green line segment to branch avenue on january 13 2001 this did not mean the end of the growth of the system: a 322-mile (518xc2xa0km) extension of the blue line to largo town center and morgan boulevard opened on december 18 2004 the first in-fill station nomaxc2xa0xe2x80x93 gallaudet

construction began in march 2009 for an extension to dulles airport to be built in two phases{22] the first phase five stations connecting east falls church to tysons corner and wiehle avenue in reston opened on july 26 2014{23]metro construction required billions of federal dollars originally provided by congress under the authority of the national capital transportation act of 1969 (public law 91-143) the cost was paid with 67 federal money and 33 local money this act was amended on january 3 1980 by public law 96-184 "the national capital transportation amendment of 1979" (also known as the stark-harris act) which authorized additional funding of 17 billion to permit the completion of 895 miles (1440xc2xa0km) of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding grant agreement executed with wmata in july 1986 which required 20 to be paid from local funds on november 15 1990 public law 101-551 "the national capital transportation amendments of 1990" authorized an additional 13 billion in federal funds for construction of the remaining 135 miles (217xc2xa0km) of the 103-mile (166xc2xa0km) system completed via the execution of full funding grant agreements with a 63 federal37 local matching{24]the highest ridership for a single day was on the day of the inauguration of barack obama january 20 2009 with 1120000 riders it broke the previous record set the day before of 866681 riders{25] june 2008 set several ridership records: the single-month ridership record of 19729641 total riders the record for highest average weekday ridership with 1044400 weekday trips had five of the ten highest ridership days and had 12 weekdays in which ridership exceed 800000 trips{10]in february 2006 metro officials chose randi miller a car dealership employee from woodbridge virginia to record new "doors opening" "doors closing" and "please stand clear of the doors thank you" announcements after winning an open contest to replace the messages recorded by sandy carroll in 1996 the "doors closing" contest attracted 1259 contestants from across the country{26]on october 30 2010 the crowd at the rally to restore sanity andor fear broke a 19-year record in saturday ridership with 825437 trips{27] the previous record had been set on june 8 1991 at 786358 trips during the desert storm rally{28]opening dates{edit]yearlinefromtomarch 27 1976redfarragut

repetitive design motifs metro stations display aspects of brutalist design the stations also reflect the influence of washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults weese worked with cambridge massachusetts-based lighting designer bill lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system{30]{31] all of metro's original brutalist stations are found in downtown washington dc and neighboring urban corridors of arlington virginia while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs{32]in 2007 the design of the metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the "america's favorite architecture" list compiled by the american institute of architects (aia) and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public surveyin january 2014 the aia announced that it would present its twenty-five year award to the washington metro system for "an architectural design of enduring significance" that "has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years" the announcement cited the key role of weese who conceived and implemented a "common design kit-of-parts" which continues to guide the construction of new metro stations over a quarter-century later albeit with designs modified slightly for cost reasons{33]intersection of coffered concrete ceiling vaults

lines 91 stations and 118 miles (190xc2xa0km) of route{34] the rail network is designed according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm with rail lines running between downtown washington and its nearby suburbs the system makes extensive use of interliningxc2xa0xe2x80x93 running more than one service on the same track there are six operating lines{34] the system's official map was designed by noted graphic designer lance wyman{35] and bill cannan while they were partners in the design firm of wyman  cannan in new york city{36]about 50 miles (80xc2xa0km) of metro's track is underground as are 47 of the 91 stations track runs underground mostly within the district and high-density suburbs surface track accounts for about 46 miles (74xc2xa0km) of the total and aerial track makes up 9 miles (14xc2xa0km){34] the system operates on a unique track gauge of 4xc2xa0ftxc2xa08xc2xa01xe2x81x844xc2xa0in (1429xc2xa0mm) this is 14 of an inch narrower than 4xc2xa0ftxc2xa08xc2xa01xe2x81x842xc2xa0in (1435xc2xa0mm) standard gauge{why?]in an effort to gain revenues wmata has started to allow retail ventures in metro stations wmata has authorized dvd-rental vending machines and ticket booths for the old town trolley tours and is seeking additional retail tenants{37]washington metro linesline

appropriated financing from the maryland virginia and washington dc governments which are represented on metro's board of directors the system does not have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit systems do critics allege that this has contributed to metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems{38]for fiscal year 2015 the estimated farebox recovery ratio (fare revenue divided by operating expenses) was 66 percent based on the wmata approved budget{39]infrastructure{edit]stations{edit]main article: list of washington metro stationsthere are 40 stations in the district of columbia 15 in prince george's county 11 in montgomery county 11 in arlington county 11 in fairfax county and three in the city of alexandria{34] the second phase of the silver line will add 6 new stationsxe2x80x94three more in fairfax county and three in loudoun county virginiaxe2x80x94in 2019 or 2020{40]at 196 feet (60xc2xa0m) below the surface the forest glen station on the red line is the deepest in the system there are no escalators; high-speed elevators take 20 seconds to travel from the street to the station platform the wheaton station one stop to the north of the forest glen station has the longest continuous escalator in the usa and in the western hemisphere at 230 feet (70xc2xa0m){34]{41] the rosslyn station is the deepest station on the orangeblue line at 117 feet (36xc2xa0m) below street level the station features the second-longest continuous escalator in the metro system at 194 feet (59xc2xa0m); an escalator ride between the street level and the mezzanine level takes nearly two minutes{42]the system is not centered on any single station but metro center is at the intersection of the red orange blue and silver lines{43] the station is also the location of wmata's main sales office metro has designated five other "core stations" that have high passenger volume including:{44] gallery place transfer station for the red green and yellow lines; l'enfant plaza transfer station for the orange blue silver green and yellow lines; union station the busiest station by passenger boardings;{43] farragut north; and farragut westin order to deal with the high number of passengers in transfer stations metro is studying the possibility of building pedestrian connections between nearby core transfer stations for example a 750-foot (230xc2xa0m) passage between metro center and gallery place stations would allow passengers to transfer between the orangebluesilver and yellowgreen lines without going one stop on the red line another tunnel between farragut west and farragut north stations would allow transfers between the red and orangebluesilver lines decreasing transfer demand at metro center by an estimated 11{44] the farragut pedestrian tunnel has yet to be physically implemented but was added in virtual form effective october 28 2011 the smartrip system now interprets an exit from one farragut station and entrance to the other as part of a single trip allowing card holders to transfer on foot without having to pay a second full fare{45]rolling stock{edit]main article: washington metro rolling stocktrain of rohr cars arriving at the cheverly stationmetroxe2x80x99s fleet consists of 1126 rail cars each 75 feet (2286xc2xa0m) long{46] trains have a maximum speed of 75xc2xa0mph (121xc2xa0kmh) and average 33xc2xa0mph (53xc2xa0kmh) including stops operating rules presently limit their top speed to 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh){34] all cars operate as married pairs (consecutively numbered even-odd with a cab at each end of the pair except 7000 series railcars) with systems shared across the pair{47] metro currently operates 850 cars during rush hours there are 814 cars in active service four cars have been permanently removed from revenue service for use as the "money train" and the remaining 36 cars compose gap trains to serve as backup should a train experience

are expected to be retired in 2019 because of poor quality and unreliability{citation needed]metro's rolling stock was acquired in six phases and each version of car is identified with a separate series number the original order of 300 rail cars (90 of which are in operation as of april 18 2017{49]) was manufactured by rohr industries with final delivery in 1978 these cars are numbered 1000xe2x80x931299 and were rehabilitated in the mid-1990s breda costruzioni ferroviarie (breda) now ansaldobreda manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984 these cars numbered 2000xe2x80x932075 were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by alstom in hornell new york a third order of 288 cars also from breda were delivered between 1984 and 1988 these cars are numbered 3000xe2x80x933291 and were rehabilitated by alstom in the early 2000s an order of 100 cars from breda numbered 4000xe2x80x934099 were delivered between 1992 and 1994 a fifth order of 192 cars was manufactured by construcciones y auxiliar de ferrocarriles (caf) of spain these cars are numbered 5000xe2x80x935191 and were delivered from 2001 through 2004 a sixth order of 184 cars from alstom transportation are numbered 6000-6183 and were delivered between 2005 and 2007 the cars have body shells built in barcelona spain with assembly completed in hornell new york{51]the 7000 series of cars currently being built by kawasaki heavy industries rolling stock company of kobe japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013 and first entered service april 14 2015 on the blue line the new cars are different from previous models in that while still operating as married pairs the cab in one car was eliminated turning it into a b car the new design allows for increased passenger capacity elimination of redundant equipment greater energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs the national transportation safety board investigation of the fatal june 22 2009 accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash as a result on july 26 2010 metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars{52]{53] an additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new silver line to dulles airport (64 for each phase) in may 2013 metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars which will replace all of the 4000 series cars{54] on july 13 2015 wmata used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748{55]signaling and operation{edit]main article: washington metro signaling and operationduring normal passenger operation on revenue tracks trains are designed to be controlled by an integrated automatic train operation (ato) and automatic train control (atc) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention all trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors make station announcements and supervise their trains the system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary{56]since june 2009 when two red line trains collided and killed nine people due in part to malfunctions in the atc system all metro trains have been manually operated{57] the current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks speed restrictions and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains increased dwell time and worse on-time performance{58] metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017{59] but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues{60]the train doors were originally designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them much as elevator doors do almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled at present the doors may be opened automatically or manually if a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction the operator must re-open the doorhours and headways{edit]metrorail begins service at 5 am monday through friday 7 am on saturdays and 8 am sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm monday through thursday 1:00 am friday and saturday and 11:00 pm on sundays although the last trains leave the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times{61]{not in citation given] trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the red line and 9 minutes on all other lines headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend the midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two metrorail lines (orangeblue and yellowgreen) as each route can run every 12 minutes; in the case of the red line every other train bound for glenmont terminates at silver spring instead night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutesother service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only on the red line every other train bound for shady grove terminates at grosvenor-strathmore in addition to the alternating terminations at silver spring mentioned above for the yellow line all trains bound for fort totten terminate at mount vernon square these are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the systemuntil 1999 metro ended service at midnight every night and weekend service began at 8 am that year wmata began late night service on fridays and saturdays until 1 am by 2007 with encouragement from businesses that closing time had been pushed back to 3 am{62] with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight there were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011 but they were met with resistance by riders{63] wmata temporarily discontinued late night rail service on may 30 2016 so that metro can conduct an extensive track rehabilitation program in an effort to improve the system's reliability{64]{65]on june 25 2017 metro changed its hours of operation with closing at 11:30 pm mondayxe2x80x93thursday 1 am on friday and saturday and 11 pm on sunday{66]{67] with the last trains leaving the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times{68]special service patterns{edit]metro runs special service patterns on holidays and when events in washington may require additional service independence day activities require metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity to and from the national mall{69] wmata makes similar adjustments during other events such as presidential inaugurations metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion{70]rush plus{edit]in 2012 wmata announced enhanced rush period service that was implemented on june 18 2012 under the name xe2x80x9crush+xe2x80x9d (or xe2x80x9crush plusxe2x80x9d) rush plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30xe2x80x939:00 am and 3:30xe2x80x936:00 pm monday through fridaythe rush+ realignment was intended to free up space in the rosslyn portal (the tunnel between rosslyn and foggy bottom) which operates at full capacity already when silver line service began those trains would be routed through the tunnel and so some of what were blue line trains to largo town center were now diverted across the fenwick bridge to become yellow line trains running all the way up the green line to greenbelt select yellow line trains running south diverted along the blue line to franconia-springfield (as opposed to the normal yellow line terminus at huntington) until the start of silver line service excess rosslyn tunnel capacity was used by additional orange line trains that traveled along the blue line to largo (as opposed to the normal orange line terminus at new carrollton) rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys though severely increasing headways for the portion of the blue line running between pentagon and rosslyn in may 2017 metro announced that yellow rush+ service would be eliminated effective june 25 2017{71]passenger information systems{edit]pids signs at the gallery place stationa passenger information display system (pids) was installed in all metrorail stations in 2000 displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations and provide real-time information on next train arrivals delayed trains emergency announcements and related information{72] wmata also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices{73] in 2010 metro began sharing its pids data with outside software developers for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices free apps are available to the public on major mobile device software platforms (ios android windows phone palm){74]{75] wmata also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010{76]fare structure{edit]see also: smartripstandard self-service vending machines for passes and farecards located at each stationriders enter and exit the system using a stored-value card in the form of a proximity card known as smartrip the fare is deducted from the balance of the card when exiting{77] smartrip cards can be purchased at station vending machines online or at retail outlets and can store up to 300 in valuemetro fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day at entry during peak hours (weekdays from opening until 9:30xc2xa0am and 3xe2x80x937xc2xa0pm) fares (effective 2014) range from 225 to 600 depending on distance traveled at all other times fares range from 200 to 385 based on distance traveled discounted fares are available for school children the disabled and the elderly{78] metro charges reduced fares on all federal holidays{79]{not in citation given]since june 25 2017 the first fare hike in three years peak-period rail fares increased 10 cents with 225 as the new minimum and 6 as the maximum one-way fare off-peak fares rose 25 cents to 2 minimum 385 maximum as will bus fares{80]{81]{82]{67] a new one-day unlimited

card{92]{93]students at district of columbia public schools ride both metrobus and metrorail for free{94]fare history{edit]front face of an old paper metro farecard listing declining-balance value remainingthe contract for metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to cubic transportation systems{95] electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on july 1 1977 a little more than a year after the first stations opened prior to electronic fare collection exact change fareboxes were used{96] metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by bay area rapid transit which cubic won a contract for in 1974{95] any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit and passes were printed with the expiration dateseveral adjustments were made to shift the availability of passes from paper tickets to smartrip cards in 2012 and 2013 in may 2014 metro announced plans to retrofit more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense smartrip cards rather than paper fare cards and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely{97] this was completed in early december 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold{98] the faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on march 6 2016{99]{100] and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to smartrip was june 30 2016{100]safety and security{edit]security{edit]main article: metro transit police departmentmetro transit police cruisermetro planners designed the system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations the open vaulted ceiling design of stations and the limited obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights metro's attempts to reduce crime combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind{101] has contributed to metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the united states{102] there are nearly 6000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security{103]metro is patrolled by its own police force which is charged with ensuring the safety of passengers and employees transit police officers patrol the metro system and metrobuses and they have jurisdiction and arrest powers throughout the 1500-square-mile (3900xc2xa0km2) metro service area for crimes that occur on or against transit authority facilities or within 150 feet (46xc2xa0m) of a metrobus stop the metro transit police department is one of two us police agencies that has local police authority in three "state"-level jurisdictions (maryland virginia and the district of columbia) the us park police being the other{104]each city and county in the metro service area has similar ordinances that regulate or prohibit vending on metro-owned property and which prohibit riders from eating drinking or smoking in metro trains buses and stations; the transit police have a reputation for enforcing these laws rigorously one widely publicized incident occurred in october 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old ansche hedgepeth for eating french fries in the tenleytown-au station{105] in a 2004 opinion by john roberts now chief justice of the united states the dc circuit court of appeals upheld hedgepeth's arrest{106] by then wmata had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles and arresting them only after three violations within a yearmetro's zero-tolerance policy on food trash and other sources of disorder embodies the "broken windows" philosophy of crime reduction this philosophy also extends to the use of station restroom facilities a longstanding policy intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity has been to only allow employees to use metro restrooms{102] station managers may make exceptions for passengers with small children the elderly or the disabled{107] metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission except during periods of heightened terror alerts{108]random bag searches{edit]on october 27 2008 the metro transit police department announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks purses and other bags transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station it also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously{109] metro claims that the united states court of appeals for the second circuit decision in macwade v kelly{110] which upheld random searches on the new york city subway allows metro transit police to take similar action{111] metro transit police chief michael taborn stated that if someone were to turn around and simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator metro has "a plan to address suspicious behavior"{112] security expert bruce schneier characterized the plan as "security theater against a movie plot threat" and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security{113]the metro riders' advisory council recommended to wmataxe2x80x99s board of directors that metro hold at least one public meeting regarding the search program as of december 2008{update] metro had not conducted a single bag search{114]in 2010 metro once again announced that it would implement random bag searches and conducted the first such searches on december 21 2010{115] the searches consist of swabbing bags and packages for explosive residue and x-raying or opening any packages which turned up positive on the first day of searches at least one false positive for explosives was produced which metro officials indicated could occur for a variety of reasons including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range{116] the dc bill of rights coalition and the montgomery county civil rights coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches taking the position that the practice violates the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and would not improve security{117] on january 3 2011 metro held a public forum for the searches at a metro riders' advisory council meeting at which more than 50 riders spoke out most of them in opposition to the searches however at the meeting metro officials called random bag inspections a "success" and claimed that few riders had complained{118]after a prolonged absence as of february 2017{update] bag searches have resumed at random stations throughout the washington metro areasafety{edit]accidents and incidents{edit]main article: incidents on the washington metroseveral collisions have occurred on washington metro resulting in injuries and fatalities along with numerous derailments with few or no injuries wmata has been criticized for disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts the tri-state oversight committee oversaw wmata but had no regulatory authority metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents but could not require other metro departments to implement its recommendations{119] following several safety lapses the federal transit administration assumed oversight at wmata{120]collisions{edit]crash at the woodley park station on november 3 2004during the blizzard of 1996 on january 6 a metro operator was killed when a train failed to stop at the shady grove station the four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment the national transportation safety board (ntsb) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system the ntsb recommended that metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system even in inclement weather and recommended that metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains{121]on november 3 2004 an out-of-service red line train rolled backwards into the woodley park station hitting an in-service train stopped at the platform the rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first car of the standing train (4018) no one was killed but 20 people were injured{122] a 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station safety officials estimated that had the train been full at least 79 people would have died the train operator was dismissed and metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars{123]june 22 2009 crash in which nine people were killedon june 22 2009 at 5:02xc2xa0pm two trains on the red line collided a southbound train heading toward shady grove stopped on the track short of the fort totten station and another southbound train collided with its rear the front car of the moving train (1079) was telescoped by the rear car of the standing train (5066){124] and passengers were trapped nine people died and more than 70 were injured dozens of whom were described as "walking wounded"{125] red line service was suspended between the fort totten and takoma stations and new hampshire avenue was closed{126]{127] one of the dead was the operator of the train that collided with the stopped trainon november 29 2009 at 4:27xc2xa0am two trains collided at the west falls church train yard one train pulled in and collided into the back of the other train no customers were aboard and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported however three cars (1106 1171 and 3216) were believed to be damaged beyond repair{128]derailments{edit]green line train following the january 7 2007 derailmenton january 13 1982 a train derailed at a malfunctioning crossover switch south of the federal triangle station in attempting to restore the train to the rails supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed the other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support killing three people and injuring 25 coincidentally this crash occurred about 30 minutes after air florida flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th street bridge during a major snowstorm{6]on january 20 2003 during construction of a new canopy at the national airport station metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations and a blue line train derailed at the switch no injuries resulted but the crash delayed construction by a number of weeks{129]on january 7 2007 a green line train carrying approximately 120 people derailed near the mount vernon square station in downtown washington trains were single-tracking at the time and the derailment of the fifth car occurred where the train was switching from the south to northbound track the crash injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel{130] at least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury{131]the mount vernon square crash was one of a series of five derailments involving 5000-series cars with four of those occurring on side tracks and not involving passengers{131]on june 9 2008 an orange line train (2000-series) derailed between the rosslyn and court house stations{132]{133]on february 12 2010 a red line train derailed at about 10:13xc2xa0am as it left the farragut north station in downtown washington after leaving the station the train entered the pocket track north of the station as it continued an automatic derailer at the end of the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure if the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track it would have entered the path of an oncoming train the wheels of the first two cars in the six-car white-flint-bound train were forced off the tracks stopping the train almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50xc2xa0am and the ntsb arrived on the scene by noon two minor injuries were reported and a third passenger was taken to george washington university hospital{134] the ntsb ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and wmata management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track{135]on april 24 2012 around 7:15 pm a blue line train bound for franconiaxe2x80x93springfield derailed near rosslyn no injuries were reported{136]on july 6 2012 around 4:45 pm a green line train bound for downtown washington dc and branch avenue derailed near west hyattsville no injuries were reported a heat kink due to the hot weather was identified as the probable cause of the accident{137]on august 6 2015 a non-passenger train derailed outside smithsonian station the track condition that caused the derailment had been detected a month earlier but was not repaired{138]on july 29 2016 a silver line train heading in the direction of wiehle-reston east station derailed outside east falls church station service was suspended between ballston and west falls church and mclean stations on the orange and silver lines{139]on september 1 2016 metro announced the derailment of an empty six-car train in the alexandria rail yard no injuries or service interruptions were reported and an investigation is ongoing{140]safety measures{edit]on july 13 2009 wmata adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for train or bus operators found to be texting or using other hand-held devices while on the job this new and stricter policy came after investigations of several mass-transit accidents in the us found that operators were texting at the time of the accident the policy change was announced the day after a passenger of a metro train videotaped the operator texting while operating the train{141]smoke incidents{edit]on january 12 2015 during early evening rush a yellow line train stopped in the tunnel and filled with smoke just after departing l'enfant plaza for pentagon due to "an electrical arcing event" ahead in the tunnel everyone on board was evacuated; 84 people were taken to hospitals and one person died{142]on march 14 2016 an electrified rail caught fire between mcpherson square and farragut west causing significant disruptions on the blue orange and silver lines on march 15 a decision was made to close the entire rail network the following day to inspect the network's entire electric rail power grid{143]future expansion{edit]wmata expects an average of one million riders daily by 2030 the need to increase capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations{144] population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service build new stations and construct additional linessilver line{edit]the new tysons corner station under construction next to virginia state route 123 in july 2012main article: silver line (washington metro)the most prominent expansion is the dulles corridor metrorail project dubbed the silver line a 23-mile (37xc2xa0km) extension from the orange line into loudoun county virginia by way of tysons corner and washington dulles international airport rail to dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976 the current silver line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the federal transit administration in 2004{145] after several delays federal funding for phase 1 was secured in december 2008{146] and construction began in march 2009{147] the line is being constructed in two phases; the first phase to wiehle xe2x80x93 reston east in reston virginia opened july 26 2014{148] and the second phase to ashburn beyond dulles airport is projected for completion in 2019 or 2020{149]blue line realignment{edit]blue line trains share a single tunnel with orange line and silver line trains to cross the potomac river the current tunnel limits service in each direction creating a choke point a 2001 proposal would have rerouted the blue line between the rosslyn and stadiumxe2x80x93armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from virginia to a new station in georgetown{150] the proposal was later rejected due to cost{151] but metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011{152]orange line extension{edit]the virginia department of transportation (vdot) announced on january 18 2008 that it and the virginia department of rail and public transportation (drpt) had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement (eis) for the i-66 corridor in fairfax and prince william counties according to vdot the eis officially named the i-66 multimodal transportation and environment study would focus on improving mobility along i-66 from the capital beltway (i-495) interchange in fairfax county to the interchange with us route 15 in prince william county the eis also allegedly includes a four-station extension of the orange line past vienna the extension would continue to run in the i-66 median and would have stations at chain bridge road fair oaks stringfellow road and centreville near virginia route 28 and us route 29{153] in its final report published june 8 2012 the study and analysis revealed that an "extension would have a minimal impact on metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor"{154]fort belvoir and fort meade extensions{edit]in 2005 the defense department announced that it would be shifting 18000 jobs to fort belvoir in virginia and at least 5000 jobs to fort meade in maryland by 2012 as part of that year's base realignment and closure plan in anticipation of such a move local officials and the military proposed extending the blue and green lines to service each base the proposed extension of the green line could cost 100 million per mile (60 million per kilometer) and a light rail extension to fort belvoir was estimated to cost up to 800 million neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction{155]{156]potomac yard station{edit]see also: potomac yard stationin 2008 officials began to explore the possibility of adding an infill station called potomac yard in the potomac yard area of alexandria on the blue and yellow lines between the national airport and braddock road stations in 2010 the alexandria city council approved a portion of the proposed 240 million construction of the station construction would start in 2017 and the station is expected to open in 2020{157]other new rail lines{edit]in 2011 metro began studying the needs of the system through 2040{152] new metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the capital beltway; a new line from the friendship heights metro station to white oak maryland which would pass through the district and silver spring; an extension of the green line to national harbor in maryland; and re-routing the blue line in the district between the orange line and green line none of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction{152]related non-wmata projects{edit]proposed route of the purple linea number of light rail and urban streetcar projects have been proposed to extend or supplement service provided by metro like the silver line in virginia the proposed purple line has been in planning since the 1980s{158] the project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the metrorail system in a pattern roughly mirroring the capital beltway{159] the current proposal would create a light rail system in maryland between the bethesda and new carrollton stations by way of silver spring and college park such a plan would connect both branches of the red line to the green and orange lines and would decrease the travel time between suburban metro stations{158]{160]the corridor cities transitway (cct) is a proposed 15-mile (24xc2xa0km) bus rapid transit line that would link clarksburg maryland in northern montgomery county with the shady grove station on the red line{161] assuming that the anticipated federal state and local government funds are provided construction of the first 9 miles (14xc2xa0km) of the system would begin in 2018{162]in 2005 a maryland lawmaker proposed a light rail system to connect areas of southern maryland especially the rapidly growing area around the town of waldorf to the branch avenue station on the green line{163]the district of columbia department of transportation is building the new dc streetcar system to improve transit connectivity within the district a tram line to connect bolling air force base to the anacostia station and was originally expected to open in 2010 streetcar routes have been proposed in the atlas district capitol hill and the k street corridor{164] after seven years of construction the atlas district route known as the hbenning street route opened on february 27 2016{165]in 2013 the georgetown business improvement district proposed a gondola lift between georgetown and rosslyn as an alternative to placing a metro stop at georgetown in its 2013xe2x80x932028 economic plans{166] washington dc and arlington county have been conducting feasibility studies for it since 2016{166]see also{edit]list of
