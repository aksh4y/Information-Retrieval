australian broadcasting company the abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the "a" system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the "b" system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the "company" was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc modelthe australian broadcasting corporation act 1983{1] changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983{1] although funded and owned by the government the abc remains editorially independent as ensured through the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983{1]the abc is sometimes informally referred to as "aunty"{2]{3]{4] originally in imitation of the british broadcasting corporation's nickname{5]history{edit]main article: history of the australian broadcasting corporation1920sxe2x80x9340s{edit]see also: australian broadcasting companyabc mobile studio caravan used for concerts presented by the abc at army camps and other locations 1940the first public radio station in australia opened in sydney on 23 november 1923 under the call sign 2sb with other stations in melbourne brisbane adelaide perth and hobart following{6] a licensing scheme administered by the postmaster-general's department was soon established allowing certain stations government funding albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content{7]following a 1927 royal commission inquiry into radio licensing issues the government established the national broadcasting service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations it also nationalised the australian broadcasting company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations{7] on 1 july 1932 the australian broadcasting commission was established taking over the operations of the national broadcasting service and eventually establishing offices in each of australia's capital cities{7]{8]the abc's perth headquarters in 1937over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy{9] the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sector{9]news broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from sir keith murdoch who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and john hinde began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s in 1939 warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by joseph lyons{10]in 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast{11] directions from the minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the commission's annual report{11] it was used only once in 1963{11] in the same year "kindergarten of the air" began on abc radio in perth and was later broadcast nationallycater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945:by the end of world war ii the abc was a decadent hollow institution its authority had been compromised by a poorly drafted charter and further undermined by timid management poor governance and creeping wartime censorship in april 1945 boyer refused to accept the post of chairman until prime minister curtin issued a mandate of independence which boyer drafted itself the abc under boyer and general manager charles moses invested as best it could in the cultural capital of the nation establishing viable symphony orchestras and seizing on the potential of television {boyer's] neutrality was never seriously questioned{12]1950sxe2x80x9370s{edit]see also: abc televisionplay mediathe first broadcast of abc tv xe2x80x93 presented by michael charlton 5 november 1956james dibble reading the

abn-2 (new south wales) sydney was inaugurated by prime minister robert menzies on 5 november 1956 with the first broadcast presented by michael charlton and james dibble reading the first television news bulletin{13] abv-2 (melbourne victoria) followed two weeks later on 18 november 1956 stations in other capital cities followed: abq-2 (brisbane queensland) (1959) abs-2 (adelaide south australia) (1960) abw-2 (perth western australia) (1960) and abt-2 (hobart tasmania) (1960) abc-3 canberra opened in 1961 and abd-6 (darwin northern territories) started broadcasting in 1971 both named after the base cityalthough radio programs could be distributed nationally by landline television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s{14] this meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by teleprinter to be prepared and presented separately in each city with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state{14] other television programs at the time included the popular six o'clock rock hosted by johnny o'keefe mr squiggle as well as operas and plays{14]in 1973 new south wales rugby league boss kevin humphreys negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the abc{15] in 1975 colour television was introduced into australia and within a decade the abc had moved into satellite broadcasting greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally in the same year the abc introduced a 24-hour-a-day am rock station in sydney 2jj (double jay) which was eventually expanded into the national triple j fm network{16] a year later a national classical music network was established on the fm band broadcasting from adelaide it was initially known as abc-fm (now called abc classic fm) xe2x80x93 referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency{16]abc budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985 in 1978 the abc nsw staff association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference sydney abc was off air for four days{17] a packed free concert in support was held at the regent theatre and compered by bob hudson it featured fred dagg and robyn archer{18] in 1991 tom molomby wrote:"the effects of the budget reductions had been so badly handled that the organisation was to remain seriously crippled for years"{19]1980sxe2x80x9390s{edit]the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983{1] changed the name of the organisation from the "australian broadcasting commission" to the "australian broadcasting corporation" effective 1 july 1983{1] at the same time the newly formed corporation underwent significant restructuring the abc was split into separate television and radio divisions with an overhaul of management finance property and engineering{20] geoffrey whitehead{21] was the initial managing director; however following his resignation in 1986 david hill (at the time chair of the abc board) took over his positionprogram production in indigenous affairs comedy social history and current affairs was significantly expanded while the corporation's output of drama was boosted{20] local production trebled from 1986xe2x80x9391 with the assistance of co-production co-financing and pre-sales arrangements{20]a new concert music department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs{20] open-air free concerts and tours educational activities and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach{20]abc radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 xe2x80x93 radio one became the metropolitan network while radio 2 became known as radio national (callsigns however were not standardised until 1990) new programs such as the world today australia all over and the coodabeen champions were introduced while abc-fm established an australian music unit in 1989{20] radio australia began to focus on the asia-pacific region with coverage targeted at the south west and central pacific south-east asia and north asia radio australia also carried more news coverage with special broadcasts during the 1987 fijian coup tiananmen square massacre and the first gulf war{20]the abc's sydney headquarters in ultimoin 1991 the corporation's sydney radio and orchestral operations moved to a new building built by leighton holdings{22] on a single site in the inner-city suburb of ultimo{23] in melbourne the abc southbank centre was completed in 1994 and now houses the radio division in victoria as well as the melbourne symphony orchestra{23]the abc multimedia unit was established in july 1995 to manage the new abc website (launched in august) funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content the first online election coverage was put together in 1996 and included news electorate maps candidate information and live results{23]by the early 1990s all major abc broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation while regional radio coverage in australia was extended with 80 new transmitters{23] live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990{23] abc newsradio a continuous news network broadcast on the parliamentary and news network when parliament is not sitting was launched on 5 october 1994{23]international television service australia television international was established in 1993 while at the same time radio australia increased its international reach{23] reduced funding in 1997 for radio australia resulted in staff and programming cuts{23]australia television was sold to the seven network in 1998 however the service continued to show abc news and current affairs programming up until its closure in 2001{24] the abc's television operation joined its radio and online divisions at the corporation's ultimo headquarters in 2000{25]2000s{edit]in 2001 digital television commenced after four years of preparation{25] in readiness the abc had fully digitised its production post-production and transmission facilities xe2x80x93 heralded at the time as "the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour"{25] the first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series something in the air grass roots and in the mind of the architectat the same time the abc's multimedia division was renamed "abc new media" becoming an output division of the abc alongside television and radio{25] legislation allowed the abc to provide 'multichannels' xe2x80x93 additional digital-only television services managed by the new media division soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001 fly tv and the abc kids channel launched showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and childrenin 2002 the abc launched abc asia pacific xe2x80x93 the replacement for the defunct australia television international operated previously by the seven network much like its predecessor and companion radio network radio australia the service provided a mix of programming

minister for communications helen coonan inaugurated the channel at parliament house three days later{27] genre restrictions limiting the types of programming the channel could carry were lifted in october 2006 xe2x80x93 abc2 was henceforth able to carry programming classified as comedy drama national news sport and entertainment{28]a high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the abc's offices in brisbane led to the closure of the site based in toowong on 21 december 2006 sixteen women were diagnosed with the disease in a period spanning 1994 to 2007{29] a progress report released in march 2007 by an independent panel formed to investigate the occurrences found that the rate of occurrence for breast cancer rate at the offices was eleven times higher than elsewhere{30] xe2x80x93 after the closure of the site the abc's brisbane-based television and radio operations were moved to alternate locations around the city including ten brisbane's studios at mt coot-tha the abc's managing director mark scott announced in august 2007 that new studios would be built on the site following the final release of the review and scientific investigation panel's report{31] in january 2012 the abc in brisbane moved into purpose-built accommodation in south bank{32]on 8 february 2008 abc tv was rebranded as abc1 complementing the existing abc2 digital-only channel which was

directors{40] consisting of a managing director{41] five to seven directors{41] and until 2006 a staff-elected director{41]{42] the managing director is appointed by the board for a period of up to five years but is eligible for renewal{43] the authority and guidelines for the appointment of directors is provided for in the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983{1]{44]{45]appointments to the abc board made by successive governments have often resulted in criticism of the appointees' political affiliation background and relative merit{46]{47] past appointments have associated directly with political parties xe2x80x93 five of fourteen appointed chairmen have been accused of political affiliation or friendship include richard downing and ken myer (both of whom publicly endorsed the australian labor party at the 1972 election){26] as well as sir henry bland david hill was close to neville wran while donald mcdonald was considered to be a close friend of john howardfrom 2003 the howard government made several controversial appointments to the abc board including prominent abc critic janet albrechtsen{48] ron brunton{49] and keith windschuttle{47]{50]during their 2007 federal election campaign labor announced plans to introduce a new system similar to that of the bbc for appointing members to the board{51]{52] under the new system candidates for the abc board would be considered by an independent panel established "at arm's length" from the communications minister{53] if the minister chose someone not on the panel's shortlist they would be required to justify this to parliament the abc chairman would be nominated by the prime minister and endorsed by the leader of the opposition{51]{54]{55]the new merit-based appointment system was announced on 16 october in

from its retail outlets in the 2006xe2x80x9307 federal budget the abc received a823xc2xa0million of government funding{66] increased to 840xc2xa0million in 2008xe2x80x9309{67] in the 2009xe2x80x9310 federal budget the abc received funding of 9299 million{68]until 1948 the abc was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the australian broadcasting act that meant the abc would receive its funding directly from the federal government licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the whitlam labor government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters{26]the term "where your 8 cents a day goes" coined in the late 1980s during funding negotiations{69] is often used in reference to the services provided by the abc{70] it is estimated that the cost of the abc per head of population per day was 71 cents a day based on the corporation's 2007xe2x80x9308 'base funding' of 543xc2xa0million{71] budget figures above show the abc costs over 14 cents per day todaythe australian communications minister senator stephen conroy indicated strong support from the government for the abc's funding submission for the 200910 budget saying the organisation had been underfunded for many years{72]politics and criticism{edit]see also: abc board and history of the australian broadcasting corporationindependence and impartiality{edit]under the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983{73] the abc board is bound to "maintain the independence and integrity of the corporation" and to ensure that "the gathering and presentation by the corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism"in relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives the current abc editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that:{74] the abc gather and present news and information with impartiality and presents a diversity of perspectives so that over time no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented the broadcaster is expected to take no editorial stance other than a commitment to fundamental democratic principlesxe2x80x94xe2x80x89abc editorial policycriticisms{edit]as a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of "bias" at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertakenreviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released{75]{76] a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country{77] in mid 2013 the university of the sunshine coast released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either labor or the greens whereas just under a third planned to vote coalition in contrast over 40 of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third labor{78]{79]dr rhonda jolly's 2014 abc overview noted that "many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming" and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the "narrow middle-class values of the australian secular left" and said that "while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a 'from the left' perspective" jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc "deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased" and that "speaking from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government" the paper noted that in december 2013 abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs{80] in response to one set of criticisms journalist annabel crabb who has worked at the abc commented: "every single day i see that organisation give voices to australians who otherwise wouldn't be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources"{81]1960s and 1970s{edit]the conservative liberal party governments in the 1960s and 1970s attempted{according to whom?] to influence the abc's political coverage by threatening to reduce funding for its news and current affairs division{82]{83]hawke-keating government{edit]bob hawke criticised some of the 730 report's coverage of the 1991 gulf war to which he committed naval forces as being "loaded" "biased" and "disgraceful"{84]howard government{edit]during the howard government years abc tv's masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists lateline host maxine mckew (pictured) ran for labor against liberal prime minister john howard in the 2007 electionfor much of the howard government years abc tv's masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists kerry o'brien barrie cassidy and maxine mckew 730 report and insiders were hosted by former labor staffers kerry o'brien and barrie cassidy respectively while the 2007 election saw lateline host mckew defeat liberal prime minister john howard as the labor candidate for the seat of bennelong at that same election liberal front bencher joe hockey was challenged unsuccessfully by abc sydney news weatherman turned labor candidate mike bailey in the seat of north sydney{85]of the 1996 prime ministerial election debates between opposition leader john howard and labor prime minister paul keating howard later wrote: "i flatly refused to have kerry o'brien of the abc {moderate the debates] because of the way he had handled the second keating-hewson debate in 1993" in which o'brien "went in to bat" for keating{86] howard went on to win that election a decade later the abc media watch program reported that nsw liberal senator concetta fierravanti-wells had written to her constituents to say that the abc had "a collective loathing" of john howard{87] at the end of the howard government's term in 2007 left-wing political commentator robert manne wrote in the monthly that the howard government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by "left-wing ideologues" who had "supposedly pushed the agenda of the left on issues like refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation radical feminism extreme environmentalism anti-americanism gay rights and so on"{2]soon after coming to office in 1996 the howard government reduced the abc's operating grants by 10{88] its appointment of jonathan shier to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows{89]{90] shier left the position early on 31 october 2001{91] 730 report anchor kerry o'brien opposed howard's budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the "conservative obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culture"{92]in howard's last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era{93] peter mares reported for radio national that "some wags described it as an 'internal promotion' while others said she'd simply moved from the 'media wing' to the 'political wing' of the alp" mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward who said: " i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there" while mckew said there was no left wing bias though "what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophy"{94]rudd-gillard-rudd government (2007xe2x80x932013){edit]abc tv's masthead political programs continued to have strong labor party connections through the period in october 2010 the abc announced that former labor staffer kerry o'brien would host four corners beginning in 2011{95]{96] former labor staffer barrie cassidy continued to host the insiders program in december 2010 chris uhlmann husband of labor mp gai brodtmann was appointed as co-host of the 730 current affairs program{97] in 2012 sydney abc news anchor juanita phillips began a relationship with labor's minister for climate change greg combet{98]{99]{100]{101]conservative commentators such as andrew bolt{102] tim blair and gerard henderson{102] accused the abc of a left-wing biasabbott-turnbull government (2013xe2x80x93present){edit]liberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-operated with the guardian to publish stolen documents purporting to reveal monitoring of indonesian officials by australian spy agencies under the rudd government abbott told 2gb radio: "a lot of people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyone's side but australia's"{103]{104]{105] abbott reportedly called the qa program a "lefty lynch mob"{106] when it invited a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in june 2015 abbott asked the makers of the program: "whose side are you on?"{107]{108] the abc found that there had been an "error of judgement' but repeated the program later in the week prompting abbott to say that "heads should roll" over the affair{109] abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the qa program following the affair{110]the broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc and required 46 cuts over five years as part of his "budget repair" program{111]{112] in early 2015 an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockey's first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 7:30 and lateline finding that the interviewers had given the impression of bias{113]when abbott lost the leadership to turnbull in the september 2015 liberal leadership spill the hosts of the abc's political programs spoke in favour of abbott's demise kerry o'brien and barrie cassidy hosts respectively of the abc's flagship weekly current affairs programs four corners and insiders welcomed the replacement of abbott by turnbull{114]{115] as did abc radio commentators fran kelly{116] paul bongiorno{117] and amanda vanstone{118] fairfax and news limited reported that leigh sales the host of 730 gave turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of abbott{119]{120]in a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we don't do that kind of journalism we don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards"{121] following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote "how can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abc's unlawful and dangerous leftist bias?" while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters{122]over the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued prompting a call for restraint from the abc's editorial policy manager mark maley{123]an interview by abc presenter joe o'brien with lyle shelton was the subject of a complaint by the australian christian lobby bringing up ian thorpe's swimming achievements o'brien asked shelton "what right do you have to

1965 it has been updated several times including with the introduction of colour television in 1975 the line was thickened to feature colour in the logo the 1975 logo is the longest-running logo with
