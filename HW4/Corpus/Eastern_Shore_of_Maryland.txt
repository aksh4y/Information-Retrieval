cecil county with harford county pennsylvania borders across the masonxe2x80x93dixon line) with delaware to the east and north the atlantic ocean on the east and virginia's own eastern shore on the south maryland's and virginia's eastern shore and all of delaware form the delmarva peninsulathe counties comprising the eastern shore are caroline cecil dorchester kent queen anne's somerset talbot wicomico and worcester counties to the south the calvert-scarborough line separates maryland from virginia a modern worcester county highway map (pdf) shows this location while comprising different boundaries than in the 17th-18th century the eastern shore's geographic definition was set once everyone agreed on where watkins pointxe2x80x94on the western side of the peninsulaxe2x80x94is and where the bay's shoreline began (since the bay side peters out into marshes and wetlands)in 1668 philip {calvert] obtained virginia recognition of maryland's claims to present-day somerset county surveying a dividing line between the two colonies with surveyor general of virginia edmund scarborough meanwhile he negotiated treaties with lower eastern shore indian tribes harassing english settlers these treaties defined standards of conduct for indian-english relations establishing an overall peace in the region{1]a farm in kent countythe northern limit is harder to locate some dispute cecil county as a true shore territory due to i-95's presence with its surrounding developments proximity to and influence from nearby urban areas like philadelphia and wilmington and a position straddling the elk riverxe2x80x93leaving 50 west of the shorelike new castle county delaware cecil county is crossed by the fall line a geologic division where the rockier highlands of the piedmont region meet the atlantic coastal plain a flat sandy area that forms the coast the coastal plain includes the delmarva peninsula and hence the eastern shore of maryland the geology of delmarva is an inseparable part of the eastern shore which has few rocky outcrops south of kent countythe chesapeake and delaware canal crosses from back creek on the elk river to port penn delaware while it was a shallow canal with locks after its construction in 1829 it was deepened in the early 20th century to sea level and physically separates the delmarva peninsula from the rest of the united states maryland south of the canal is considered the eastern shore by residents the term western shore is used by eastern shore residents to describe all the counties of maryland west of the chesapeake bay but especially those of the baltimore-washington metropolitan area and southern marylandblackwater national wildlife refugethe north-south section of the masonxe2x80x93dixon line forms the border between maryland and delaware the border was originally marked every mile by a stone and every five miles by a "crownstone" the line is not quite due north and south but is as straight as survey methods of the 1760s could make it it was surveyed as a compromise solution to a century-long wrangle between the penn and calvert families of england if the chesapeake baydelaware bay watershed divide had been taken as the borderline delaware would be about half its current sizefinally although this has received less attention than other parts of eastern shore culture commercial east-west ties between delaware towns and maryland towns were culturally significant in colonial and early american periods despite the border line (which largely cut through woods and swamps) trade with philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to delaware towns like odessa (then called cantwell's bridge) and smyrna (then called duck creek) agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the delaware river by "shallop men" in small vessels called shallops these cultural connections continue to this dayocean city is a modern resort on what was once called the "seaside" or "seaboard side" it is on a long north-south sandspit that is essentially a barrier island{2]history{edit]queen anne's county courthouseearly history{edit]william claiborne was granted land (part of the colony of virginia) in 1629 and named the land "kent county" in 1631 he sailed north up the chesapeake bay from its south and west side to the area known today as kent island there he made a fortified settlement that is considered to be the first english settlement within the province of maryland talbot county was formed in 1662 cecil county was formed in 1674 by proclamation of the governor from eastern portions of baltimore county and the northern portion of kent county wicomico county was formed in 1867 as the 9th and last county created from somerset and worcester countiesformation of the counties{edit]1642 kent county-in 1642 the governor and council appointed commissioners for the isle and county of kent this act appears to have led to the establishment of kent county name after kent county england1661 talbot county- named for lady grace talbot the wife of sir robert talbot an irish statesman and the sister of cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore1666 somerset county-named for mary lady somerset the wife of sir john somerset and daughter of thomas arundell 1st baron arundell of wardour1669 dorchester county-named for the earl of dorset a family friend of the calverts (the founding family of the maryland colony)1674 cecil county1706 queen anne's county- formed from northern parts of talbot and southern portions of kent name after queen anne of great britain who reigned when the county was established1742 worcester county-named for an earl of worcester1773 caroline county- formed from parts of dorchester and queen anne's counties the county derives its name from lady caroline eden wife of maryland's last colonial governor of the province of maryland robert eden1867 wicomico countylater history{edit]chesapeake bay maritime museum in st michaelsocean city was founded on july 4 1875{3] when the atlantic hotel opened on assateague island at the time assateague island was continuous from the delaware state line to well south of ocean city: the ocean city inlet was not formed until a hurricane in august 1933 cut across the south end of the town although the inlet was cut not by waves sweeping inland but by 4 or 5 days' worth of freshwater runoff from the coastal creeks running seaward by 1935 government money had built jetties to make the inlet permanent dividing fenwick island (north) from assateague island (south) early transportation to the island was by trainuntil the 1820s travel and commerce between the eastern shore and baltimore were less important than the connections between it and philadelphia water travel by sailboat and steamer linked the eastern shore to baltimore more tightly beginning about 1813 when the first steamboat traveled the bay by the 1880s railroad lines linked the eastern shore to philadelphia and later norfolk virginia by way of a railroad line straight south from wilmington to dover delmar salisbury and cape charles maryland's eastern shore was served by branch lines running generally southwest from the main route see list of railroad lines in the delmarva peninsula the eastern shore's many branchlines were built after the civil war by local companies; eventually all were controlled by the pennsylvania railroad (which also bought control of the steamboat and ferry routes) then conrail and norfolk southern today the remaining active railroad tracks on the eastern shore are operated by short-line railroads bay coast railroad delmarva central railroad and the maryland and delaware railroadan east-west rail route ran from a ferry terminal at claiborne west of st michaels to ocean city via the baltimore and eastern shore railroad and the wicomico and pocomoke railroad travelers could also take a ferry to love point on kent island board a queen anne's railroad train and travel east to lewes and rehoboth beach delawareautomobile transportation across the chesapeake bay was by ferryboat until 1952 when the first chesapeake bay bridge was opened for trafficin the late 1950s and early 1960s developers began selling lots on assateague island south of the inlet however a storm on march 6 1962 destroyed houses shacks and roads{4] the state and federal governments intervened before reconstruction by creating the assateague island national seashore and assateague state parkan eastern shore baseball league operated on three different occasions between 1922 and 1949{5] it was a class d minor league with
