b'iceberg - wikipedia icebergfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchfor other uses see iceberg (disambiguation)iceberg in the arctic with its underside visiblean iceberg or ice mountain is a large piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water{1]{2] it may subsequently become frozen into pack ice (one form of sea ice) as it drifts into shallower waters it may come into contact with the seabed a process referred to as seabed gouging by ice also about 91 of an iceberg is below the surface of the watercontents1

the dutch word ijsberg literally meaning ice mountain{3] cognate to danish isbjerg german eisberg low saxon iesbarg and swedish isbergoverview{edit]grotto in an iceberg photographed during the british antarctic expedition of 1911xe2x80x931913 5 jan 1911 photographer: herbert ponting alexander turnbull librarybecause the density of pure ice is about 920 kgm3 and that of seawater about 1025xc2xa0kgm3 typically one-tenth of the volume of an iceberg is above water (due to archimedes's principle) the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface this has led to the expression "tip of the iceberg" for a problem or difficulty that is only a small manifestation of a larger problemicebergs generally range from 1 to 75 metres (33 to 2461xc2xa0ft) above sea level and weigh 100000 to 200000 metric tons (110000 to 220000 short tons) the largest known iceberg in the north atlantic was 168 metres (551xc2xa0ft) above sea level reported by the uscg icebreaker east wind in 1958 making it the height of a 55-story building these icebergs originate from the glaciers of western greenland and may have an interior temperature of xe2x88x9215 to xe2x88x9220xc2xa0xc2xb0c (5 to xe2x88x924xc2xa0xc2xb0f){4]icebergs are usually confined by winds and currents to move close to the coast the largest icebergs recorded have been calved or broken off from the ross ice shelf of antarctica iceberg b-15 photographed by satellite in 2000 measured 295 by 37 kilometres (183 by 23xc2xa0mi) with a surface area of 11000 square kilometres (4200xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) the largest iceberg on record was an antarctic tabular iceberg of over 31000 square kilometres (12000xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) {335 by 97 kilometres (208 by 60xc2xa0mi)] sighted 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) west of scott island in the south pacific ocean by the uss glacier on november 12 1956 this iceberg was larger than belgium{5]when a piece of iceberg ice melts a fizzing sound called the "bergie seltzer" is produced this sound is made when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice as this happens each bubble bursts making a 'popping' sound the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice that eventually got buried to a given depth (up to several kilometers) and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice{4]recent large icebergs{edit]the calving of iceberg a-38 off ronne ice shelficeberg b-15 11000xc2xa0km2 (4200xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) 2000iceberg a-38 about 6900xc2xa0km2

(100xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) broken off of petermann glacier in northern greenland on aug 5 2010 considered to be the largest arctic iceberg since 1962{9] about a month later this iceberg split into two pieces upon crashing into joe island in the nares strait next to greenland{10] in june 2011 large fragments of the petermann ice islands were observed off the labrador coast{11]iceberg b-17b

island in the southern oceanin addition to size classification icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape the two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top much like a plateau with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1{13] this type of iceberg also known as an ice island{14] can be quite large as in the case of pobeda ice island antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf such as the ross ice shelf or filchner-ronne ice shelf are typically tabular the largest icebergs in the world are formed this waynon-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include:{15]different shapes of icebergs 1: tabular; 2: wedge; 3: dome; 4: drydock; 5: pinnacled; 6: blockydome: an iceberg with a rounded toppinnacle: an iceberg with one or more spireswedge: an iceberg with a steep edge on one side and a slope on the opposite sidedry-dock: an iceberg that has eroded to form a slot or channelblocky: an iceberg with steep vertical sides and a flat top it differs from tabular icebergs in that its shape is more like a block than a flat sheetmonitoring{edit]acoustic monitoring of an icebergicebergs are monitored worldwide by the us national ice center (nic) established in 1995 which produces analyses and forecasts of arctic antarctic great lakes and chesapeake bay ice conditions more than 95 of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the earthiceberg a22a in the south atlantic oceanthe nic is the only organization that names and tracks all antarctic icebergs it assigns each iceberg larger than 10 nautical miles (19xc2xa0km) along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number the letters used are as follows:{16]a xe2x80x93 longitude 0xc2xb0 to 90xc2xb0xc2xa0w (bellingshausen sea weddell sea)b xe2x80x93 longitude 90xc2xb0xc2xa0w to

weddell sea)iceberg b15 calved from the ross ice shelf in 2000 and initially had an area of 11000 square kilometres (4200xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) it broke apart in november 2002 the largest remaining piece of it iceberg b-15a with an area of 3000 square kilometres (1200xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) was still the largest iceberg on earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces october 27 2005 an event that was observed by seismographs both on the iceberg and across antarctica{17] it has been hypothesized that this breakup may also have been abetted by ocean swell generated by an alaskan storm 6 days earlier and 13500 kilometres (8400xc2xa0mi) away{18]{19]history{edit]the iceberg suspected of sinking the rms titanic; a smudge of red paint much like the titanic's red hull stripe was seen near its base at the waterlinein the 20th century several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs the international ice patrol formed in 1914 in response to the april 1912 sinking of the titanic which killed 1517 of its 2223 passengers and crew monitors iceberg dangers near the grand banks of newfoundland and provides the "limits of all known ice" in that vicinity to the maritime communitytechnology history{edit]before the early 1910s there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions most likely because they weren't considered a serious threat as{citation needed] ships had managed to survive even direct crashes in 1907 ss kronprinz wilhelm a german liner had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow but was still able to complete her voyage the april 1912 sinking of the titanic however changed all that and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs for the remainder of the ice season of that year the united states navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow in november 1913 the international conference on the safety of life at sea met in london to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the international ice patrol (iip) the goal of the iip was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents ice-flow ocean temperature and salinity levels they published their first records in 1921 which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movementnew technologies monitor icebergs aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations in 1945 experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs a decade later oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data; these outposts continue to serve in environmental study a computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964 which allowed for a faster evaluation of data by the 1970s icebreaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in antarctica systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions in the 1980s drifting buoys were used in antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research they are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currentsan iceberg being pushed by three us navy ships in mcmurdo sound antarcticaside looking airborne radar (slar) made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions on november 4 1995 canada launched radarsat-1 developed by the canadian space agency it provides images of earth for scientific and commercial purposes this system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar (sar) which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs the european space agency launched envisat (an observation satellite that orbits the earth's poles){20] on march 1 2002 envisat employs advanced synthetic aperture radar (asar) technology which can detect changes in surface height accurately the canadian space agency launched radarsat-2 in december 2007 which uses sar and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as radarsat-1{21]see also{edit]list of recorded icebergs by areadrift ice stationice calvingice driftpolar ice cappolar ice pack (disambiguation)polynyasea iceseabed gouging by
