first emerged in iron age northwestern arabia and is now the lingua franca of the arab world{5] it is named after the arabs a term initially used to describe peoples living from mesopotamia in the east to the anti-lebanon mountains in the west in northwestern arabia and in the sinai peninsulathe modern written language (modern standard arabic) is derived from classical arabic it is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces government and the media the two formal varieties are grouped together as literary arabic (fuxe1xb9xa3xe1xb8xa5xc4x81) which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of islam modern standard arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary however it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical era especially in modern timesduring the middle ages literary arabic was a major vehicle of culture in europe especially in science mathematics and philosophy as a result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languages mainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese valencian and catalan owing to both the proximity of christian european and muslim arab civilizations and 800 years of arabic culture and language in the iberian peninsula referred to in arabic as al-andalus sicilian has about 500 arabic words as result of sicily being progressively conquered by saracens from north africa from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities (hull and ruffino) balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have also acquired a significant number of arabic words through contact with ottoman turkisharabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish spanish maltese urdu kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali hindi malay maldivian indonesian pashto punjabi tagalog sindhi and hausa and some languages in parts of africa conversely arabic has borrowed words from other languages including greek and persian in medieval times and contemporary european languages such as english and french in modern timesclassical arabic is the liturgical language of 17 billion muslims and modern standard arabic is one of six official languages of the united nations{6]{7]{8]{9] it is spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers (native and non-native) in the arab world{2] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although

linksclassification{edit]arabic is a central semitic language closely related to the northwest semitic languages (aramaic hebrew ugaritic and phoenician) the ancient south arabian languages and various other semitic languages of arabia such as dadanitic the semitic languages changed a great deal between proto-semitic and the establishment of the central semitic languages particularly in grammar innovations of the central semitic languagesxe2x80x94all maintained in arabicxe2x80x94include:the conversion of the suffix-conjugated stative formation (jalas-) into a past tensethe conversion of the prefix-conjugated preterite-tense formation (yajlis-) into a present tensethe elimination of other prefix-conjugated moodaspect forms (eg a present tense formed by doubling the middle root a perfect formed by infixing a t after the first root consonant probably a jussive formed by a stress shift) in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix-conjugation forms (eg -u for indicative -a for subjunctive no ending for jussive -an or -anna for energetic)the development of an internal passivethere are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hijaz these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor proto-arabic the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for proto-arabic:{10]negative particles m mxc4x81;

article: old arabicarabian languagesarabia boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family (eg southern thamudic) were spoken it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages (non-central semitic languages) were also spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern hijaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages in najd and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic{11]beginning in the 1st century ce fragments of northern old arabic are attested in the nabataean script across northern arabia by the 4th century ce the nabataean aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of arabic other than that of the nabataeansold hijazi and classical arabic{edit]in late pre-islamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hijaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the hijra most strongly in judeo-christian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the "learned" tradition (classical arabic){12] this variety and both its classicizing and "lay" iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an old higazi register it is clear that the orthography of the qur'xc4x81n was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic; rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higaziin the late 6th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal "poetic koine" distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd probably in connection with the court of al-xe1xb8xa4xc4xabra during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabic-writing persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of non-standardized classical arabic elements in morphology and syntax the standardization of classical arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century the first comprehensive description of the xcaxbfarabiyya "arabic" sxc4xabbawayhi's al-kitxc4x81b is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts in addition to qur'xc4x81n usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the xcaxbfarabiyya{13] by the 8th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic worldneo-arabic{edit]charles ferguson's koine theory (ferguson 1959) claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times ahmad al-jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests: northern and central (al-jallad 2009) the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories{13] according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa{14]{15]classical modern standard and spoken arabic{edit]see also: list of arabic dictionariesarabic usually designates one of three main variants: classical arabic modern standard arabic and colloquial or dialectal arabic classical arabic is the language found in the quran used from the period of pre-islamic arabia to that of the abbasid caliphate theoretically classical arabic is considered normative according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as sibawayh) and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the lisxc4x81n al-xcaxbbarab) in practice however modern authors almost never write in pure classical arabic instead using a literary language with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary commonly known as modern standard arabic (msa)msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa and the middle east and understood by most educated arabic speakers "literary arabic" and "standard arabic" (xd9x81xd9x8fxd8xb5xd9x92xd8xadxd9x8exd9x89 fuxe1xb9xa3xe1xb8xa5xc3xa1) are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabicsome of the differences between classical arabic (ca) and modern standard arabic (msa) are as follows:certain grammatical constructions of ca that have no counterpart in any modern dialect (eg the energetic mood) are almost never used in modern standard arabicno modern spoken variety of arabic has case distinctions as a result msa is generally composed without case distinctions in mind and the proper cases are added after the fact when necessary because most case endings are noted using final short vowels which are normally left unwritten in the arabic script it is unnecessary to determine the proper case of most words the practical result of this is that msa like english and standard chinese is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in ca for emphasis are rare in addition because of the lack of case marking in the spoken varieties most speakers cannot consistently use the correct endings in extemporaneous speech as a result spoken msa tends to drop or regularize the endings except when reading from a prepared textthe numeral system in ca is complex and heavily tied in with the case system this system is never used in msa even in the most formal of circumstances; instead a significantly simplified system is used approximating the system of the conservative spoken varietiesmsa uses much classical vocabulary (eg dhahaba 'to go') that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa in addition msa has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve{16] some words have been borrowed from other languagesxe2x80x94notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation (eg xd9x81xd9x90xd9x84xd9x92xd9x85 film 'film' or xd8xafxd9x8axd9x85xd9x82xd8xb1xd8xa7xd8xb7xd9x8axd8xa9 dxc4xabmuqrxc4x81xe1xb9xadiyyah 'democracy')however the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use loan translations (eg xd9x81xd8xb1xd8xb9 farxcaxbb 'branch' also used for the branch of a company or organization; xd8xacxd9x86xd8xa7xd8xad janxc4x81xe1xb8xa5 'wing' is also used for the wing of an airplane building air force etc) or to coin new words using forms within existing roots (xd8xa7xd8xb3xd8xaaxd9x85xd8xa7xd8xaaxd8xa9 istimxc4x81tah 'apoptosis' using the root xd9x85xd9x88xd8xaa mwt 'death' put into the xth form or xd8xacxd8xa7xd9x85xd8xb9xd8xa9 jxc4x81mixcaxbbah 'university' based on xd8xacxd9x85xd8xb9 jamaxcaxbba 'to gather unite'; xd8xacxd9x85xd9x87xd9x88xd8xb1xd9x8axd8xa9 jumhxc5xabriyyah 'republic' based on xd8xacxd9x85xd9x87xd9x88xd8xb1 jumhxc5xabr 'multitude') an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse (eg xd9x87xd8xa7xd8xaaxd9x81 hxc4x81tif 'telephone' < 'invisible caller (in sufism)'; xd8xacxd8xb1xd9x8axd8xafxd8xa9 jarxc4xabdah 'newspaper' < 'palm-leaf stalk')colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from classical arabic colloquial arabic has many regional variants; geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible and some linguists consider them distinct languages{17] the varieties are typically unwritten they are often used in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows{18] as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertisingthe only variety of modern arabic to have acquired official language status is maltese which is spoken in (predominately catholic) malta and written with the latin script it is descended from classical arabic through siculo-arabic but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of arabic most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of arabicflag of the arab league used in some cases for the arabic languageflag used in some cases for the arabic languageeven during muhammad's lifetime there were dialects of spoken arabic muhammad spoke in the dialect of mecca in the western arabian peninsula and it was in this dialect that the quran was written down however the dialects of the eastern arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time so the language of the quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern phonology it is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of classical arabic the phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of arabic writing most notably the writing of the glottal stop or hamzah (which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech) and the use of alif maqxe1xb9xa3xc5xabrah (representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with xc4x81 in eastern speech){citation needed]language and dialect{edit]the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught standard arabic as well as their native mutually unintelligible "dialects";{19]{20]{21]{22]{23] these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their own{24] when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation (for example a moroccan speaking with a lebanese) many speakers code-switch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or filmthe issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged in the same way it is for the varieties of chinese hindi and urdu serbian and croatian scots and english etc in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot{25] the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor: a single written form significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms for political reasons arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions{26]from a linguistic standpoint it is often said that the various spoken varieties of arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the romance languages{27] this is an apt comparison in a number of ways the period of divergence from a single spoken form is similarxe2x80x94perhaps 1500 years for arabic 2000 years for the romance languages also while it is comprehensible to people from the maghreb a linguistically innovative variety such as moroccan arabic is essentially incomprehensible to arabs from the mashriq much as french is incomprehensible to spanish or italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them this suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languagesinfluence of arabic on other languages{edit]see also: list of arabic loanwords in englishthe influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries because it is the language of the islamic sacred book the quran arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as baluchi bengali berber bosnian catalan chechen dagestani english french german gujarati hausa hindustani italian indonesian kazakh kurdish kutchi malay pashto persian portuguese punjabi rohingya saraiki sicilian sindhi somali spanish swahili tagalog turkish uzbek and wolof as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken{citation needed]in addition english has many arabic loanwords some directly but most via other mediterranean languages examples of such words include admiral adobe alchemy alcohol algebra algorithm alkaline almanac amber arsenal assassin candy carat cipher coffee cotton ghoul hazard jar kismet lemon loofah magazine mattress sherbet sofa sumac tariff and many other words{citation needed] other languages such as maltese{28] and kinubi derive ultimately from arabic rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rulesterms borrowed range from religious terminology (like berber taxe1xbax93allit "prayer" from salat (xd8xb5xd9x84xd8xa7xd8xa9 xe1xb9xa3alxc4x81h)) academic terms (like uyghur mentiq "logic") and economic items (like english coffee) to placeholders (like spanish fulano "so-and-so") everyday terms (like hindustani lekin "but" or spanish taza and french tasse meaning "cup") and expressions (like catalan a betzef "galore in quantity") most berber varieties (such as kabyle) along with swahili borrow some numbers from arabic most islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from arabic such as xd8xb5xd9x84xd8xa7xd8xa9 (salat) "prayer" and xd8xa5xd9x85xd8xa7xd9x85 (imam) "prayer leader"in languages not directly in contact with the arab world arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from arabic for example most arabic loanwords in hindustani and turkish entered through persian though persian is an indo-iranian language older arabic loanwords in hausa were borrowed from kanurisome words in english and other european languages are derived from arabic often through other european languages especially spanish and italian among them are commonly used words like "coffee" (xd9x82xd9x87xd9x88xd8xa9 qahwah) "cotton" (xd9x82xd8xb7xd9x86 quxe1xb9xadn) and "magazine" (xd9x85xd8xaexd8xa7xd8xb2xd9x86 makhxc4x81zin) english words more recognizably of arabic origin include "algebra" "alcohol" "alchemy" "alkali" "zenith" and "nadir"arabic words also made their way into several west african languages as islam spread across the sahara variants of arabic words such as xd9x83xd8xaaxd8xa7xd8xa8 kitxc4x81b ("book") have spread to the languages of african groups who had no direct contact with arab traders{29]since throughout the islamic world arabic occupied a position similar to that of latin in europe many of the arabic concepts in the fields of science philosophy commerce etc were coined from arabic roots by non-native arabic speakers notably by aramaic and persian translators and then found their way into other languages this process of using arabic roots especially in kurdish and persian to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries when swaths of arab-inhabited lands were under ottoman ruleinfluence of other languages on arabic{edit]the most important sources of borrowings into (pre-islamic) arabic are from the related (semitic) languages aramaic{30] which used to be the principal international language of communication throughout the ancient near and middle east ethiopic and to a lesser degree hebrew (mainly religious concepts) in addition many cultural religious and political terms have entered arabic from iranian languages notably middle persian parthian and (classical) persian{31] and hellenistic greek (kxc4xabmiyxc4x81xcaxbc has as origin the greek khymia meaning in that language the melting of metals; see roger dachez histoire de la mxc3xa9decine de l'antiquitxc3xa9 au xxe sixc3xa8cle tallandier 2008 pxc2xa0251) alembic (distiller) from ambix (cup) almanac (climate) from almenichiakon (calendar) (for the origin of the last three borrowed words see alfred-louis de prxc3xa9mare foundations of islam seuil l'univers historique 2002) some arabic borrowings from semitic or persian languages are as presented in de prxc3xa9mare's above-cited book:madxc4xabnahmedina (xd9x85xd8xafxd9x8axd9x86xd8xa9 city or city square) a word of aramaic or hebrew origin

alphabet and nationalism{edit]there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language currently the only arabic language to use latin script is malteselebanon{edit]the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922 the major head of this movement was louis massignon a french orientalist who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damacus in 1928 massignon's attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country sa'id afghani a member of the academy mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a zionist plan to dominate lebanon{32]{33]egypt{edit]after the period of colonialism in egypt egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize egyptian culture as a result some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be used{32]{33] there was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the latin alphabet but this was seen as too complicated to use{32]{33] a scholar salama musa agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology this change in alphabet he believed would solve the problems inherent with arabic such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn{32]{33] ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi two egyptian intellectuals agreed with musa and supported the push for romanization{32]{34] the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd al-aziz fahmi in 1944 he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of cairo{32]{34] however this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic alphabet{32]{34] in particular the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history which is easy to believe due to the long history of the arabic alphabet (shrivtiel 189) in muslim societiesthe language of the quran and its influence on poetry{edit]the quran introduced a new way of writing to the world people began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the quran into not only their own writing but also their culture the deep level on which the quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the reader's soul writers studied the unique structure and format of the quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the readerquran's figurative devices{edit]the quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses the arrangement of words how certain sounds create harmony and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse at times the chapters of the quran only have the rhythm in common{35]the repetition in the quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry the repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran the quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief metaphors were not a new concept to poetry however the strength of extended metaphors was the explicit imagery in the quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work the poet ibn al mu'tazz wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the quran opoets such as badr shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the quran{36] the quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible the study of the pauses in the quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways{37]structure{edit]although the quran is known for its fluency and harmony the structure can be best described as chaotic the suras also known as verses of the quran are not placed in chronological order the only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow the topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of rhyme the quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text harmony is also present in the sound of the quran the elongations and accents present in the quran create a harmonious flow within the writing unique sound of the quran recited due to the accents create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection{36]the quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people the simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style{36] the words of the quran although unchanged are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal arabic the simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the quran a slightly easier taskculture and the quran{edit]the writer al-khattabi explains how culture is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it he believes that fluency and harmony the quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text while a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the quran a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the quran{37] because the structure of the quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen hadith were the main source of chronological order the hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context poetry after the quran began possessing this element of tradition by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning{35]after the quran came down to the people the tradition of memorizing the verses became present it is believed that the larger amount of the quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith as technology improved overtime hearing recitations of quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus the tradition of love poetry served as a symbolic representation of a muslim's desire for a closer contact with their lordwhile the influence of the quran on arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers some writers such as al- baqillani believe that poetry and the quran are in no conceivable way related due to the uniqueness of the quran poetry's imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the quran holdsarabic and islam{edit]classical arabic is the language of poetry and literature (including news); it is also mainly the language of the quran at present modern standard arabic (msa) is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the quran arabic is closely associated with the religion of islam because the quran was written in arabic but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as arab christians mizrahi jews druze and iraqi mandaeans most of the world's muslims do not speak classical arabic as their native language but many can read the quranic script and recite the quran among non-arab muslims translations of the quran are most often accompanied by the original textsome muslims present a monogenesis of languages and claim that the arabic language was the language revealed by god for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication based upon its system of triconsonantal roots spoken by man from which all other languages were derived having first been corrupted{38]{39] judaism has a similar account with the tower of babeldialects and descendants{edit]main article: varieties of arabicdifferent dialects of arabiccolloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken dialects of arabic used throughout the arab world which differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the arabian peninsula followed by that between sedentary varieties and the much more conservative bedouin varieties all of the varieties outside of the arabian peninsula (which include the large majority of speakers) have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in classical arabic this has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the arab conquest whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas (these features are present to varying degrees inside the arabian peninsula generally the arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties but have been understudied)within the non-peninsula varieties the largest difference is between the non-egyptian north african dialects (especially moroccan arabic) and the others moroccan arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to arabic speakers east of libya (although the converse is not true in part due to the popularity of egyptian films and other media)one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fxc4xabh and north african kayxc9x99n all mean 'there is' and all come from classical arabic forms (yakxc5xabn fxc4xabhi kxc4x81'in respectively) but now sound very differentexamples{edit]transcription is a broad ipa transcription so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison also

or all of these varieties ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine:loss of the dual (grammatical number) except on nouns with consistent plural agreement (cf feminine singular agreement in plural inanimates)change of a to i in many affixes (eg non-past-tense prefixes ti- yi- ni-; wi- 'and'; il- 'the'; feminine -it in the construct state)loss of third-weak verbs ending in w (which merge with verbs ending in y)reformation of geminate verbs eg xe1xb8xa5alaltu 'i untied'

consonants only one has been lost: xcax92{clarification needed] which merged with xcax83{44] but the consonant xcax92 is still found in many colloquial arabic dialects various other consonants have changed their sound too but have remained distinct an original p lenited to f and xc9xa1 - consistently attested in pre-islamic greek transcription of arabic languages{45] - became palatalized to xc9xa1xcaxb2 or xc9x9f by the time of the quran and dxcdxa1xcax92 xc9xa1 xcax92 or xc9x9f in msa (see arabic phonologylocal variations for more detail){46] an original voiceless alveolar lateral fricative xc9xac became xcax83{47] its emphatic counterpart xc9xacxcbxa0xc9xaexcbxa4 was considered by arabs to be the most unusual sound in arabic (hence the classical arabic's appellation xd9x84xd9x8fxd8xbaxd9x8exd8xa9xd9x8f xd9xb1xd9x84xd8xb6xd9x8exd9x91xd8xa7xd8xafxd9x90 lughat al-xe1xb8x8dxc4x81d or "language of the xe1xb8x8dxc4x81d"); for most modern dialects it has become an emphatic stop dxcbxa4 with loss of the laterality{47] or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization d (the classical xe1xb8x8dxc4x81d pronunciation of pharyngealization xc9xaexcbxa4 still occurs in the mehri language and the similar sound without velarization xc9xae exists in other modern south arabian languages)other changes may also have happened classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of proto-semitic propose different phonetic values one example is the emphatic consonants which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in proto-semitic{47]reduction of j and w between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak ("defective") verbs early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium bcthe classical arabic language as recorded was a poetic koine that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the arabian peninsula who spoke the most conservative variants of arabic even at the time of muhammed and before other dialects existed with many more changes including the loss of most glottal stops the loss of case endings the reduction of the diphthongs aj and aw into monophthongs excbx90 oxcbx90 etc most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of arabican interesting feature of the writing system of the quran (and hence of classical arabic) is that it contains certain features of muhammad's native dialect of mecca corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard classical arabic among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing j: evidently final -awa became axcbx90 as in the classical language but final -aja became a different sound possibly excbx90 (rather than again axcbx90 in the classical language) this is the apparent source of the alif maqxe1xb9xa3xc5xabrah 'restricted alif' where a final -aja is reconstructed: a letter that would normally indicate j or some similar high-vowel sound but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of alif and represent the sound axcbx90literary arabic{edit]the "colloquial" spoken varieties of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers "formal" literary arabic (usually specifically modern standard arabic) is learned at school; although many speakers have a native-like command of the language it is technically not the native language of any speakers both varieties can be both written and spoken although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances eg in radio broadcasts formal lectures parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties even when the literary language is spoken however it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud when speaking extemporaneously (ie making up the language on the spot as in a normal discussion among people) speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties in fact there is a continuous range of "in-between" spoken varieties: from nearly pure modern standard arabic (msa) to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the "rough edges" (the most noticeably "vulgar" or non-classical aspects) smoothed out to pure colloquial the particular variant (or register) used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation often it will vary within a single encounter eg moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer this type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the arabic-speaking worldrecording of a poem by al-ma'arri titled "i no longer steal from nature"although modern standard arabic (msa) is a unitary language its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country the variation in individual "accents" of msa speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat note that it is important in descriptions of "arabic" phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial (spoken) dialect and the pronunciation of msa by these same speakers although they are related they are not the same for example the phoneme that derives from proto-semitic g has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties eg {dxcdxa1xcax92  xcax92  j  xc9xa1xcaxb2  xc9xa1] speakers whose native variety has either {dxcdxa1xcax92] or {xcax92] will use the same pronunciation

isn't found in msa; {dxcdxa1xcax92xcax92] is used insteadanother example: many colloquial varieties are known for a type of vowel harmony in which the presence of an "emphatic consonant" triggers backed allophones of nearby vowels (especially of the low vowels axcbx90 which are backed to {xc9x91(xcbx90)] in these circumstances and very often fronted to {xc3xa6(xcbx90)] in all other circumstances) in many spoken varieties the backed or "emphatic" vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant; in some varieties (most notably egyptian arabic) the "emphatic" allophones spread throughout the entire word usually including prefixes and suffixes even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their msa pronunciation as well but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties (for example speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate but not extreme amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their msa speech while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in msa)vowels{edit]modern standard arabic has six pure vowels with short a i u and corresponding long vowels axcbx90 ixcbx90 uxcbx90 there are also two diphthongs: aj and awthe pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety nonetheless there are some common trends most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of a and axcbx90 which tend towards fronted {xc3xa6(xcbx90)] {a(xcbx90)] or {xc9x9b(xcbx90)] in most situations but a back {xc9x91(xcbx90)] in the neighborhood of emphatic consonants some accents and dialects such as those of the hijaz have central {xc3xa4(xcbx90)] in all situations the vowel a varies towards {xc9x99(xcbx90)] too listen to the final vowel in the recording of al-xcaxbbarabiyyah at the beginning of this article for example the point is arabic has only three short vowel phonemes so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones the vowels u and xc9xaa are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well with generally more back or centralized allophones but the differences are less great than for the low vowels the pronunciation of short u and i tends towards {xcax8ao] and {iexc9xa8] respectively in many dialectsthe definition of both "emphatic" and "neighborhood" vary in ways that reflect (to some extent) corresponding variations in the spoken dialects generally the consonants triggering "emphatic" allophones are the pharyngealized consonants txcbxa4 dxcbxa4 sxcbxa4 xc3xb0xcbxa4; q; and r if not followed immediately by i(xcbx90) frequently the velar fricatives x xc9xa3 also trigger emphatic allophones; occasionally also the pharyngeal consonants xcax95 xc4xa7 (the former more than the latter) many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel depending on the particular nearby consonants in most msa accents emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant although in some it spreads a bit farther: eg xd9x88xd9x82xd8xaa waqt {wxc9x91qt]

structure{edit]arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (cv) and (cvv)xe2x80x94and closed syllables (cvc) (cvvc) and (cvcc) the syllable types with two morae (units of time) ie cvc and cvv are termed heavy syllables while those with three morae ie cvvc and cvcc are superheavy syllables superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places: at the end of the sentence (due to pausal pronunciation) and in words such as xd8xadxd8xa7xd8xb1xd9x91 xe1xb8xa5xc4x81rr 'hot' xd9x85xd8xa7xd8xafxd9x91xd8xa9 mxc4x81ddah 'stuff substance' xd8xaaxd8xadxd8xa7xd8xacxd9x88xd8xa7 taxe1xb8xa5xc4x81jjxc5xab 'they disputed with each other' where a long xc4x81 occurs before two identical consonants (a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost) (in less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before clitic suffixes such as -nxc4x81 'us our' due to the deletion of final short vowels)in surface pronunciation every vowel must be preceded by a consonant (which may include the glottal stop {xcax94]) there are no cases of hiatus within a word (where two vowels occur next to each other without an intervening consonant) some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning such as the definite article al- or words such as xd8xa7xd8xb4xd8xaaxd8xb1xd8xa7 ishtarxc4x81 'he bought' xd8xa7xd8xacxd8xaaxd9x85xd8xa7xd8xb9 ijtimxc4x81xcaxbb 'meeting' when actually pronounced one of three things happens:if the word occurs after another word ending in a consonant there is a smooth

is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are:a final vowel long or short may not be stressedonly one of the last three syllables may be stressedgiven this restriction the last heavy syllable (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed if it is not the final syllableif the final syllable is super heavy and closed (of the form cvvc or cvcc) it receives stressif no syllable is heavy or super heavy the first possible syllable (ie third from end) is stressedas a special exception in form vii and viii verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable despite the above rules: hence inkatab(a) 'he subscribed' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced) yankatib(u) 'he subscribes' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced) yankatib 'he should subscribe (juss)' likewise form viii ishtarxc4x81 'he bought' yashtarxc4xab 'he buys'examples:kitxc4x81b(un) 'book' kxc4x81-ti-b(un) 'writer' mak-ta-b(un) 'desk' ma-kxc4x81-ti-b(u) 'desks' mak-ta-ba-tun 'library' (but mak-ta-ba(-tun) 'library' in short pronunciation) ka-ta-bxc5xab (modern standard arabic) 'they wrote' = ka-ta-bu (dialect) ka-ta-bxc5xab-h(u) (modern standard arabic) 'they wrote it' = ka-ta-bxc5xab (dialect) ka-ta-ba-txc4x81 (modern standard arabic) 'they (dual fem) wrote' ka-tab-tu (modern standard arabic) 'i wrote' = ka-tabt (short form or dialect) doubled consonants count as two consonants: ma-jal-la-(tan) 'magazine' ma-xe1xb8xa5all(-un) "place"these rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced vs the normal situation where they are not pronounced as in the above example of mak-ta-ba-tun 'library' in full pronunciation but mak-ta-ba(-tun) 'library' in short pronunciationthe restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final -huhisome dialects have different stress rules in the cairo (egyptian arabic) dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word hence mad-ra-sah 'school' qxc4x81-hi-rah 'cairo' this also affects the way that modern standard arabic is pronounced in egypt in the arabic of sanaa stress is often retracted: bay-tayn 'two houses' mxc4x81-sat-hum 'their table' ma-kxc4x81-txc4xabb 'desks' zxc4x81-rat-xe1xb8xa5xc4xabn 'sometimes' mad-ra-sat-hum 'their school' (in this dialect only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a two-syllable word the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words the final syllable cannot be stressed)levels of pronunciation{edit]the final short vowels (eg the case endings -a -i -u and mood endings -u -a) are often not pronounced in this language despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs the following levels of pronunciation exist:full pronunciation with pausa{edit]this is the most formal level actually used in speech all endings are pronounced as written except at the end of an utterance where the following changes occur:final short vowels are not pronounced (but possibly an exception is made for feminine plural -na and shortened vowels in the jussiveimperative of defective verbs eg irmi! 'throw!'")the entire indefinite noun endings -in and -un (with nunation) are left off the ending -an is left off of nouns preceded by a txc4x81xcaxbe marbxc5xabxe1xb9xadah xd8xa9 (ie the -t in the ending -at- that typically marks feminine nouns) but pronounced as -xc4x81 in other nouns (hence its writing in this fashion in the arabic script)the txc4x81xcaxbc marbxc5xabxe1xb9xadah itself (typically of feminine nouns) is pronounced as h (at least this is the case in extremely formal pronunciation eg some quranic recitations in practice this h is usually omitted)formal short pronunciation{edit]this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position (with influence from the colloquial varieties) the following changes occur:most final short vowels are not pronounced however the following short vowels are pronounced:feminine plural -nashortened vowels in the jussiveimperative of defective verbs eg irmi! 'throw!'second-person singular feminine past-tense -ti and likewise anti 'you (fem sg)'sometimes first-person singular past-tense -tusometimes second-person masculine past-tense -ta and likewise anta 'you (masc sg)'final -a in certain short words eg laysa 'is not' sawfa (future-tense marker)the nunation endings -an -in -un are not pronounced however they are pronounced in adverbial accusative formations eg taqrxc4xabban xd8xaaxd9x8exd9x82xd9x92xd8xb1xd9x90xd9x8axd8xa8xd9x8bxd8xa7 'almost approximately' xcaxbbxc4x81datan xd8xb9xd9x8exd8xa7xd8xafxd9x8exd8xa9xd9x8b 'usually'the txc4x81xcaxbe marbxc5xabxe1xb9xadah ending xd8xa9 is unpronounced except in construct state nouns where it sounds as t (and in adverbial accusative constructions eg xcaxbbxc4x81datan xd8xb9xd9x8exd8xa7xd8xafxd9x8exd8xa9xd9x8b 'usually' where the entire -tan is pronounced)the masculine singular nisbah ending -iyy is actually pronounced -xc4xab and is unstressed (but plural and feminine singular forms ie when followed by a suffix still sound as -iyy-)full endings (including case endings) occur when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added (eg -nxc4x81 'usour')informal short pronunciation{edit]this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in extemporaneous speech ie when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a clitic suffix is added basically short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically:all the rules for formal short pronunciation apply except as followsthe past tense singular endings written formally as -tu -ta -ti are pronounced -t -t -ti but masculine xcaxbeanta is pronounced in fullunlike in formal short pronunciation the rules for dropping or modifying final endings are also applied when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added (eg -nxc4x81 'usour') if this produces a sequence of three consonants then one of the following happens depending on the speaker's native colloquial variety:a short vowel (eg -i- or -xc7x9d-) is consistently added either between the second and third or the first and second consonantsor a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs typically due to a violation of the sonority hierarchy (eg -rtn- is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster but -trn- needs to be broken up)or a short vowel is never added but consonants like r l m n occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a syllabic consonant (as in the english words "butter bottle bottom button")when a doubled consonant occurs before another consonant (or finally) it is often shortened to a single consonant rather than a vowel added (but note that moroccan arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence moroccan arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of modern standard arabic)the clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters in particular -ka -ki -hu generally sound as -ak -ik -uhfinal long vowels are often shortened merging with any short vowels that remaindepending on the level of formality the speaker's education level etc various grammatical changes may occur in ways that echo the colloquial variants:any remaining case endings (eg masculine plural nominative -xc5xabn vs oblique -xc4xabn) will be leveled with the oblique form used everywhere (however in words like ab 'father' and akh 'brother' with special long-vowel case endings in the construct state the nominative is used everywhere hence abxc5xab 'father of' akhxc5xab 'brother of')feminine plural endings in verbs and clitic suffixes will often drop out with the masculine plural endings used instead if the speaker's native variety has feminine plural endings they may be preserved but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speaker's native variety eg -an instead of -nadual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis (similar to their use in the colloquial varieties); elsewhere the plural endings are used (or feminine singular if appropriate)colloquial varieties{edit]further information: varieties of arabicvowels{edit]as mentioned above many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading where the "emphasis" (pharyngealization) of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone {xc9x91(xcbx90)] in all nearby low vowels the extent of emphasis spreading varies for example in moroccan arabic it spreads as far as the first full vowel (ie sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong) on either side; in many levantine dialects it spreads indefinitely but is blocked by any j or xcax83; while in egyptian arabic it usually spreads throughout the entire word including prefixes and suffixes in moroccan arabic i u also have emphatic allophones {exc9x9b] and {oxc9x94] respectivelyunstressed short vowels especially i u are deleted in many contexts many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred (especially axe2x86x92i and interchange ixe2x86x94u) most levantine dialects merge short i u into xc7x9d in most contexts (all except directly before a single final consonant) in moroccan arabic on the other hand short u triggers labialization of nearby consonants (especially velar consonants and uvular consonants) and then short a i u all merge into xc7x9d which is deleted in many contexts (the labialization plus xc7x9d is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme xc5xad) this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction with the original long vowels axcbx90 ixcbx90 uxcbx90 remaining as half-long {axcbx91 ixcbx91 uxcbx91] phonemically a i u which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabicmost spoken dialects have monophthongized original aj aw to excbx90 oxcbx90 (in all circumstances including adjacent to emphatic consonants) in moroccan arabic these have subsequently merged into original ixcbx90 uxcbx90consonants{edit]in some dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non-arabic {v] is used in the maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names semitic {p] became {f] extremely early on in arabic before it was written down; a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi (influenced by persian and kurdish) distinguish between {p] and {b] the iraqi arabic also uses sounds {xc9xa1] {txcdxa1xcax83] and uses persian adding letters eg: xdaxafxd9x88xd8xacxd8xa9 gawjah xe2x80x93 a plum; xdax86xd9x85xd8xa9 chimah xe2x80x93 a truffle and so onearly in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes {xc9xaexcbxa4] and {xc3xb0xcbxa4] coalesced into a single phoneme {xc3xb0xcbxa4] many dialects (such as egyptian levantine and much of the maghreb) subsequently lost interdental fricatives converting {xcexb8 xc3xb0 xc3xb0xcbxa4] into {t d dxcbxa4] most dialects borrow "learned" words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words but some dialects without interdental fricatives (particularly in egypt and the levant) render original {xcexb8 xc3xb0 xc3xb0xcbxa4 dxcbxa4] in borrowed words as {s z zxcbxa4 dxcbxa4]another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives q dxcdxa1xcax92 (proto-semitic xc9xa1) and k:xd9x82 q retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as yemen morocco and urban areas

('you' masc) and -ik ('you' fem) which become -ak and -itxcdxa1xcax83 respectively in sana'a omani and bahrani -ik is pronounced -ixcax83pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds in addition the "emphatic" allophone {xc9x91] automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects as a result it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given coronal consonant is phonemically emphatic or not especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading (a notable exception is the sounds t vs txcbxa4 in moroccan arabic because the former is pronounced as an affricate {txcdxa1s] but the latter is not)grammar{edit]examples of how the arabic root and form system worksmain article: arabic grammarliterary arabic{edit]main article: modern standard arabicas in other semitic languages arabic has a complex and unusual morphology (ie method of constructing words from a basic root) arabic has a nonconcatenative "root-and-pattern" morphology: a root consists of a set of bare consonants (usually three) which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words for example the word for 'i wrote' is constructed by combining the root k-t-b 'write' with the pattern -a-a-tu 'i xed' to form katabtu 'i wrote' other verbs meaning 'i xed' will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants eg qaraxcaxbctu 'i read' akaltu 'i ate' dhahabtu 'i went' although other patterns are possible (eg sharibtu 'i drank' qultu 'i said' takallamtu 'i spoke' where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix -tu is always used)from a single root k-t-b numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns:katabtu 'i wrote'kattabtu 'i had (something) written'kxc4x81tabtu 'i corresponded (with someone)'"aktabtu 'i dictated'iktatabtu 'i subscribed'takxc4x81tabnxc4x81 'we corresponded with each other'aktubu 'i

in literary arabic have three grammatical cases (nominative accusative and genitive {also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three numbers (singular dual and plural); two genders (masculine and feminine); and three "states" (indefinite definite and construct) the cases of singular nouns (other than those that end in long xc4x81) are indicated by suffixed short vowels (-u for nominative -a for accusative -i for genitive)the feminine singular is often marked by -at which is reduced to -ah or -a before a pause plural is indicated either through endings (the sound plural) or internal modification (the broken plural) definite nouns include all proper nouns all nouns in "construct state" and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article al- indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long xc4x81) add a final -n to the case-marking vowels giving -un -an or -in (which is also referred to as nunation or tanwxc4xabn)adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns however the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the -ah or -at suffixpronouns in literary arabic are marked for person number and gender there are two varieties independent pronouns and enclitics enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns the first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (-ni) and for nouns or prepositions (-xc4xab after consonants -ya after vowels)nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects however non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular furthermore a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versaverbs{edit]verbs in literary arabic are marked for person (first second or third) gender and number they are conjugated in two major paradigms (past and non-past); two voices (active and passive); and six moods (indicative imperative subjunctive jussive shorter energetic and longer energetic) the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in msa{54] there are also two participles (active and passive) and a verbal noun but no infinitivethe past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect the moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past and the future tense is signaled by prefixing sa- or sawfa onto the non-past the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem (eg past katab- vs non-past -ktub-) and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender: in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme while in the non-past a combination of prefixes (primarily encoding person) and suffixes (primarily encoding gender and number) are used the passive voice uses the same personnumbergender affixes but changes the vowels of the stemthe following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb kataba 'to write' note that in modern standard the energetic mood (in either long or short form which have the same meaning) is almost never usedderivation{edit]like other semitic languages and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology (applying a large number of templates applied roots) to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to wordsfor verbs a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems (of which there are about fifteen) each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as "form i" "form ii" and so on through "form xv" (although forms xi to xv are rare) these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative intensive and reflexive stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology not part of the inflectional systemexamples of the different verbs

from nouns); form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominativesthe associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic this is similar to the process by which for example the english gerund "meeting" (similar to a verbal noun) has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social often work-related event where people gather together to have a "discussion" (another lexicalized verbal noun) another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots such as the "nouns of location" in ma- (eg maktab 'desk office' < k-t-b 'write' maxe1xb9xadbakh 'kitchen' < xe1xb9xad-b-kh 'cook')the only three genuine suffixes are as follows:the feminine suffix -ah; variously derives terms for women from related terms for men or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine eg maktabah 'library' (also a writing-related place but different from maktab as above)the nisbah suffix -iyy- this suffix is extremely productive and forms adjectives meaning "related to x" it corresponds to english adjectives in -ic -al -an -y -ist etcthe feminine nisbah suffix -iyyah this is formed by adding the feminine suffix -ah onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns for example from the basic root sh-r-k 'share' can be derived the form viii verb ishtaraka 'to cooperate participate' and in turn its verbal noun ishtirxc4x81k 'cooperation participation' can be formed this in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective ishtirxc4x81kxc4xab 'socialist' from which an abstract noun ishtirxc4x81kiyyah 'socialism' can be derived other recent formations are jumhxc5xabriyyah 'republic' (lit "public-ness" < jumhxc5xabr 'multitude general public') and the gaddafi-specific variation jamxc4x81hxc4xabriyyah 'people's republic' (lit "masses-ness" < jamxc4x81hxc4xabr 'the masses' pl of jumhxc5xabr as above)colloquial varieties{edit]main article: varieties of arabicthe spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances) they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often bi- for indicative vs unmarked subjunctive) they have also mostly lost the indefinite "nunation" and the internal passivethe following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in egyptian arabicexample of a regular form i verb in egyptian

system {edit]main articles: arabic alphabet and arabic brailleislamic calligraphy written by a malay muslim in malaysia the calligrapher is making a rough draftthe arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through nabatean to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic scripts to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western (north african) and middle eastern versions of the alphabetxe2x80x94in particular the faxcaxbc had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals)however the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools (zaouias) of west africa arabic like all other semitic languages (except for the latin-written maltese and the languages with the ge'ez script) is written from right to left there are several styles of script notably naskh which is used in print and by computers and ruqxcaxbbah which is commonly used in handwriting{55]calligraphy{edit]main article: islamic calligraphyafter khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786 many styles were developed both for the writing down of the quran and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decorationarabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin script arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran a hadith or simply a proverb the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudyin modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language necessary for digitized unification will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy{56]romanization{edit]main article: romanization of arabicexamples

are a number of different standards for the romanization of arabic ie methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin script there are various conflicting motivations involved which leads to multiple systems some are interested in transliteration ie representing the spelling of arabic while others focus on transcription ie representing the pronunciation of arabic (they differ in that for example the same letter xd9x8a is used to represent both a consonant as in "you" or "yet" and a vowel as in "me" or "eat") some systems eg for scholarly use are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of arabic generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the arabic script these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as "xc5xa1" for the sound equivalently written sh in english other systems (eg the bahxc3xa1'xc3xad orthography) are intended to help readers who are neither arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of arabic names and phrases{57] these less "scientific" tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs (like sh and kh) these are usually simpler to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems and may lead to ambiguities eg whether to interpret sh as a single sound as in gash or a combination of two sounds as in gashouse the ala-lc romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a prime symbol ( xe2x80xb2 ); eg asxe2x80xb2hal 'easier'during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometimes known as im arabicto handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral "3" may be used to represent the arabic letter xe2x9fxa8xd8xb9xe2x9fxa9 there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it arabic chat alphabet other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the "emphatic" counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter xe2x9fxa8xd8xafxe2x9fxa9 may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart xe2x9fxa8xd8xb6xe2x9fxa9 may be written as dnumerals{edit]in most of present-day north africa the western arabic numerals (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) are used however in egypt and arabic-speaking countries to the east of it the eastern arabic numerals (xd9xa0xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa1xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa2xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa3xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa4xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa5xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa6xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa7xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa8xe2x80x8e xe2x80x93 xd9xa9xe2x80x8e) are in use when representing a number in arabic the lowest-valued position is placed on the right so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage for example 24 is said "four and twenty" just like in the german language (vierundzwanzig) and classical hebrew and 1975 is said "a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy" or more eloquently "a thousand and nine-hundred five seventy"language-standards regulators{edit]academy of the arabic language is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the arab league the most active are in damascus and cairo they review language development monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries they also publish old and historical arabic manuscriptssee also: arabic language international councilas a foreign language{edit]arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools especially muslim schools universities around the world have classes that teach arabic as part of their foreign languages middle eastern studies and religious studies courses arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn arabic outside the academic world there are many arabic language schools in the arab world and other muslim countries because the quran is written in arabic and all islamic terms are in arabic millions{citation needed] of muslims (both arab and non-arab) study the language software and books with tapes are also important part of arabic learning as many of arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or arabic language school classes available radio series of arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations{citation needed] a number of websites on the internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education; most teach modern standard arabic but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries{58]arabic speakers and other languages{edit]this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it (may 2013)in bahrain arabic is largely used in educational settingshistorically arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages and took almost no interest in learning any language other than arabic{citation needed] with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan al-gharnati - who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab - scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior{59]in modern times the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view yasir suleiman wrote in 2011 that "studying and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and  feigning or asserting weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status class and perversely even education through a mxc3xa9lange of code-switching practises"{60] arab-american professor franck salamah went as far as to declare arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas blaming its stagnation for arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with it{61]see
