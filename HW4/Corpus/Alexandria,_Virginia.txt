virginia as well as central maryland modern alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the us capital it is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service in the us military or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government one of alexandria's largest employers is the us department of defense another is the institute for defense analyses in 2005 the united states patent and trademark office moved to alexandria and in 2017 so did the headquarters of the national science foundationthe historic center of

county (1878) including what is now arlington county and the city of alexandria map includes the names of property owners at that time city boundaries roughly correspond with old townon october 21 1669 a patent granted 6000 acres (24xc2xa0km2) to robert howsing for transporting 120 people to the colony of virginia{5]:5 that tract would later become the city of alexandria{5]:5 virginia's comprehensive tobacco inspection law of 1730 mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale one of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper potomac river was at the mouth of hunting creek{6] however the ground proved to be unsuitable and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river where the water was deep near the shorefollowing the 1745 settlement of the virginia's 10 year dispute with lord fairfax over the western boundary of the northern neck proprietary when the privy council in london found in favor of lord fairfax's expanded claim some of the fairfax county gentry formed the ohio company of virginia they intended to conduct trade into the interior of america and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the potomac the best location was hunting creek tobacco warehouse since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships many local tobacco planters however wanted a new town further up hunting creek away from nonproductive fields along the river{7]around 1746 captain philip alexander ii (1704xe2x80x931753) moved to what is south of present duke street in alexandria his estate which consisted of 500 acres (20xc2xa0km2) was bounded by hunting creek hooff's run the potomac river and approximately the line which would become cameron street at the opening of virginia's 1748xe2x80x9349 legislative session there was a petition submitted in the house of burgesses on november 1 1748 that the "inhabitants of fairfax (co) praying that a town may be established at hunting creek warehouse on potowmack river" as hugh west was the owner of the warehouse the petition was introduced by lawrence washington (1718xe2x80x931752) the representative for fairfax county and more importantly the son-in-law of william fairfax and a founding member of the ohio company to support the company's push for a town on the river lawrence's younger brother george washington an aspiring surveyor made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site{8]since the river site was amidst his estate philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of hunting creek (also known as great hunting creek) it has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town alexandria in honor of philip's family as a result philip and his cousin captain john alexander (1711xe2x80x931763) gave land to assist in the development of alexandria and are thus listed as the founders this john was the son of robert alexander ii (1688xe2x80x931735) on may 2 1749 the house of burgesses approved the river location and ordered "mr washington do go up with a message to the council and acquaint them that this house have agreed to the amendments titled an act for erecting a town at hunting creek warehouse in the county of fairfax"{9] a "public vendue" (auction) was advertised for july and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots the auction was conducted on july 13xe2x80x9314 1749almost immediately upon establishment the town founders called the new town "belhaven" believed to be in honor of a scottish patriot john hamilton 2nd lord belhaven and stenton the northern neck tobacco trade being then dominated by scots the name belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a church and market house but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s{10] the town of alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779in 1755 general edward braddock organized his fatal expedition against fort duquesne at carlyle house in alexandria in april 1755 the governors of virginia and the provinces of maryland pennsylvania massachusetts and new york met to determine upon concerted action against the french in america{11]in march 1785 commissioners from virginia and maryland met in alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states finishing their business at mount vernon the mount vernon conference concluded on march 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the potomac river the maryland legislature in ratifying this agreement on november 22 proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations this led to the calling of the annapolis convention of 1786 which in turn led to the calling of the federal convention of 1787{11]in 1791 alexandria was included in the area chosen by george washington to become the district of columbiaearly 19th century{edit]slave ship taking on slaves at the alexandria waterfront in 1836 alexandria's slave trade made virginia a more pro-slavery state after retrocessionin 1814 during the war of 1812 a british fleet launched a successful raid on alexandria which surrendered without a fight as agreed in the terms of surrender the british looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour tobacco cotton wine and sugar{12] in 1823 william holland wilmer francis scott key and others founded the virginia theological seminary{13]:116 from 1828 to 1836{14] alexandria was home to the franklin  armfield slave market one of the largest slave trading companies in the country by the 1830s they were sending more than 1000 slaves annually from alexandria to their natchez mississippi and new orleans markets to help meet the demand for slaves in mississippi and surrounding states{15] later owned by price birch  co the slave pen became a jail under union occupation{16]a portion of the city of alexandriaxe2x80x94most of the area now known as "old town" as well as the areas of the city northeast of what is now king streetxe2x80x94and all of today's arlington county share the distinction of having been originally in virginia ceded to the us government to form the district of columbia and later retroceded to virginia by the federal government in 1846 when the district was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the potomac river over time a movement grew to separate alexandria from the district of columbia (the district of columbia retrocession) as competition grew with the port of georgetown and the chesapeake and ohio canal fostered development on the north side of the potomac river the city's economy stagnated together with the loss of representation and rights to vote and failed expectations for economic benefit from the new district alexandria was also an important port and market in the slave trade and there were increasing talk of abolition of slavery in the national capital alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if slavery were outlawed after a referendum voters petitioned congress and virginia to return the area to virginia congress retroceded the area to virginia on july 9 1846{17] the city of alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of alexandria county in 1870 the remaining portion of alexandria county changed its name to arlington county in 1920late 19th century{edit]map of alexandria showing the forts that were constructed to defend washington during the civil wara bird's eye view of alexandria

ellsworth was publicized as a union martyr and the incident generated great excitement in the north with many children being named for him{18] jackson's death defending his home caused a similar though less lasting sensation in the southalexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the war fort ward one of a ring of forts built by the union army for the defense of washington dc is located inside the boundaries of present-day alexandria{19] after the creation by washington of the state of west virginia in 1863 and until the close of the war alexandria was the seat of the so-called restored government of virginia also known as the "alexandria government"{11] during the union occupation a recurring contention between the alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the union army's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the president of the united states failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their churchescaped african american slaves poured into alexandria safely behind union lines the cities of alexandria and washington offered comparative freedom and employment alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the union army{20] until the emancipation proclamation escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners therefore they were labeled contrabands to avoid returning them to their masters contrabands worked the union army in various support roles by the fall of 1863 the population of alexandria had exploded to 18000xe2x80x94an increase of 10000 people in 16 months{20]as of ratification of the fifteenth amendment alexandria county's black population was more than 8700 or about half the total number of residents in the county

to pay an initiation fee and annual dues the company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the general assembly of virginiafirst city library location within an apothecary shopdruggist edward stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his apothecary shop james kennedy was elected the second librarian and the library moved to his residence and place of business kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the library company those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library the first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797 the collection grew over time bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books most members were initially men although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798 one noted female member in 1817 was mary lf custis wife of george washington parke custisthe catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books mostly on history and travel by 1815 there were 1022 entries in the catalog and the collection had added more biographies fiction and magazines the library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years including the new market house next to the city hall the lyceum company building and peabody hall which was owned by the alexandria school board raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge in 1853 a lecture series was created to raise money speakers included professor joseph henry of the smithsonian colonel francis h smith of the virginia military institute and humorist george w bagbythe arrival of the civil war in 1861 took its toll on the library collection members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by union troops the library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time after the war the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879 the library company closed the remainder of its collection was stored in peabody hallin 1897 a group of women in alexandria formed the alexandria library association the leaders of the group
