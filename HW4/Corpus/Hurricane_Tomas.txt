atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane tomas was the latest recorded tropical cyclone on a calendar year to strike the windward islands the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the windward islands on octoberxc2xa029 quickly intensifying into a hurricane it moved through the windward islands and passed over saint lucia after reaching categoryxc2xa02 status on the saffir-simpson scale tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central caribbean sea due to strong wind shear and dry air tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the windward passagethroughout the hurricane's path 71 people are known to have been killed 14 of whom were in saint lucia monetary losses throughout the windward islands were estimated at us588xc2xa0million mainly in saint lucia in the wake of the storm in haiti flooding intensified an ongoing cholera outbreak indirectly causing more fatalities however direct impacts from the hurricane in haiti were less than anticipated overall damage from the storm was at least 741xc2xa0millioncontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3

intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave or elongated low-pressure area exited the western coast of africa on octoberxc2xa024{1] it moved hastily westward across the tropical atlantic at a comparatively low latitude becoming embedded within the intertropical convergence zone{2]{3] during this time the wave's structure retained a vigorous appearance;{1] the western portion contained scattered convection with strong thunderstorms as well as a broad area of rotating winds{3] on octoberxc2xa027 when the system was about 1200xc2xa0miles (1940xc2xa0km) east-southeast of the windward islands the national hurricane center (nhc) noted favorable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis namely light wind shear{4] the wave and its expansive convection amplified over the next two days featuring hints of spiraling rainbands{1]{5] a hurricane hunters aircraft investigating the disturbance on octoberxc2xa029 observed a developing circulation with storm-force winds at sea level{6] in light of those features the nhc estimated that the system became a tropical depression by 06:00 utc that day about 460xc2xa0mi (740xc2xa0km) southeast of barbados and further upgraded it to tropical storm tomas six hours later{1]{7]on its inception tomas turned toward the northwest and decelerated{1] within a region of low wind shear and high tropical moisturexe2x80x94two of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification a misalignment between the cyclone's low- and upper-level circulations impeded this strengthening potential however and at that time the nhc did not expect tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to 48xc2xa0hours later{7] steered along high pressure to its north the storm retraced slightly west-northwestward on its approach to the windward islands{1]{8] despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening tomas' winds sharply increased to 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) by late octoberxc2xa029;{9] moreover the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band{10] the center of the intensifying storm crossed southern barbados the next morning around 09:00 utc{1] radar images from martinique soon revealed the formation of an eye;{8] tomas attained hurricane status a couple of hours later about 35xc2xa0miles (55xc2xa0km) east of saint vincent and the grenadines after hurricane hunters recorded surface winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) by that time the eye measured 35xe2x80x9346xc2xa0mi (56xe2x80x9374xc2xa0km) in diameter{11]a weakening tropical storm tomas over the atlantic on november 6tomas continued to strengthen through octoberxc2xa030 as it moved generally west- to west-northwestward around 20:00xc2xa0utc the eye traversed the northern shores of saint vincent while the northernmost ring of the severest winds skirted saint lucia{1] subsequent reports from hurricane hunters and post-storm reanalysis indicated that tomas had reached a peak intensity with wind speeds of 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 982 mbar (hpa; 2900 inhg) during its trek across the islands making it a categoryxc2xa02 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{1]{12] although the nhc noted the potential for tomas to become a major hurricane the agency conversely observed that the hurricane had begun to suffer from southwesterly wind shear which computer models forecast to increase in the long term{12] on octoberxc2xa031 a combination of this shear and pockets of dry air dispersed the convection surrounding the eye initiating a weakening trend{13] tomas diminished to a tropical storm early on novemberxc2xa01 when the strongest thunderstorms became dislocated from the low-level wind vortex by more than 115xc2xa0mi (185xc2xa0km){1]{14] tomas meandered slightly south of west for a while passing north of the abc islands overnight{1]{15] although the upper wind regime relaxed into the next day with an area of deep convection briefly reblossoming near tomas' center{15] the shear appeared to have already taken its toll on the storm with an increasingly diffuse and elongated structure tomas further weakened to a tropical depression at 00:00xc2xa0utc novemberxc2xa03 about 325xc2xa0miles (520xc2xa0km) southeast of kingston jamaica{1]{16]following its deterioration tomas diverged toward the northwest over the central caribbean{1] the circulation lost further definition adjoining a wide stretch of low pressures spanning the western caribbean a hurricane hunters mission to determine whether tomas retained its status as a tropical cyclone found that the mean low-level circulation had reformed to the northeast of the previous center tomas reattained tropical storm strength late on novemberxc2xa03{17]{18] and although the low- and mid-level centers were initially nonaligned slow restrengthening ensued into the next day{19] tomas turned northward ahead of an unseasonably strong deep-layered trough circumnavigating the western periphery of the subtropical ridge{1]{20] over a six-hour period the cyclone's core thunderstorm activity became much more concentrated with a corresponding quick drop in central pressure{21] while turning northeastward into the windward passage tomas regained hurricane status around 0600xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa05 just 36xc2xa0miles (58xc2xa0km) west-southwest of the western tip of haiti{1]{22]over the course of novemberxc2xa05 the hurricane accelerated northeastward in response to the approaching trough passing right between eastern cuba and western haiti due to its proximity to land the convection became disrupted near the center;{23] tomas reweakened to a tropical storm near the turks and caicos islands during a spell of moderate shear on novemberxc2xa06{1] after moving through that island nation tomas briefly became a hurricane for a final time before hostile wind shear from the nearby trough fully began to take effect in conjunction with increasingly dry air the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm on novemberxc2xa07 tomas lost its tropical characteristics the next day though it retained gale-force winds as an extratropical cyclone it turned sharply eastward before curving northward accelerated by a broad cyclonic steering flow over the western atlantic the next couple of days the thomas' extratropical remnant subsequently raced off into the north atlantic until it was absorbed by another extratropical system a few hundred miles south of newfoundland canada on novemberxc2xa011{1]preparations{edit]prior to the development of tomas the nhc noted the potential for heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts to spread across the windward islands venezuela and northern guyana due to the tropical wave of which later developed into hurricane tomas{24] upon development of tropical storm tomas most of the windward islands were put under a tropical storm warning issued by their respective governments; a tropical storm watch was also issued for dominica{25] six hours later as tomas was nearly a hurricane the tropical storm warning was replaced by a hurricane warning in barbados st vincent and the grenadines st lucia and martinique; the tropical storm watch in dominica was also upgraded to a tropical storm warning{26]in barbados people evacuated to schools and shelters for safety during the storm{27] on st lucia the government closed the island's two airports and ordered the closure of all businesses additionally a large creole festival was canceled due to the storm{28] officials in trinidad and tobago closed beaches across the country{29] in st vincent the national emergency management organization (nemo) issued advisories that a tropical system was approaching the country the rapid intensification of tomas caught many citizens in st vincent off guard early on october 30 the prime minister addressed the nation and informed the country of the situation it was facingfollowing the west-southwesterly motion of the storm swells generated by tomas produced breaking waves on coastal sections of the abc islands during the morning of november 1 consequently a small craft advisory was issued at 1415 utc for all three islands{30] in addition a state of severe weather was declared for bonaire and curaxc3xa7ao during the passage of tomas{31] in haiti the country which was devastated earlier in the year from a deadly january 12 earthquake government officials began preparing for possible impact from tomas by octoberxc2xa030 one united nations spokesperson remarked that a hurricane strike would be "the last thing haiti needs"{27] the haitian government issued an orange storm alert one level short of the highest state of alert and warned for the possibility of winds thunderstorms and flooding{28]impact{edit]impact by country or regioncountyregiondeathsdamagesourcebarbados0 !none7006850000000000000xe2x99xa085xc2xa0million{1]cuba0 !none1

produced a wind gust of 63xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) which damaged homes and power lines on the island{34] there were also reports of blown off roofs impassable roads and uprooted trees{35] later a station on saint lucia recorded sustained winds of 48xc2xa0mph (77xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 69xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh){36] there was widespread damage to homes and power lines{37] the winds destroyed the roof of a hospital and a school with several trees and power lines blown down{28] additionally a station on martinique reported sustained winds of 72xc2xa0mph (115xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 108xc2xa0mph (173xc2xa0kmh){38]on saint vincent there were no deaths but two persons sustained serious injuries while trying to effect repairs to house roofs and two persons were reported missing the two persons reported missing were found on november 1 off the island of balliceaux the national emergency management organization (nemo) declared all areas from park hill to owia on the eastern side and all areas from belle isle to fitz hughes on the western side disaster zones it was also reported that the agriculture sector sustained over us25xc2xa0million(ec67xc2xa0million) worth of damage over 1200 people were forced to seek refuge in hurricane shelters across st vincent about 600 houses lost their roofs a lot of downed power lines trees and landslides made some roads impassable but nemo the bridges roads and general services authority (bragsa) and the st vincent electricity services company (vinlec) were able to clear the main road by the november 1saint lucia arguably had sustained the worst damage from the storm overall throughout saint lucia severe flooding and mudslides resulted in at least 7 fatalities confirmed by the chief medical officer according to a government minister several other people were missing and buried in landslides{39] by the morning of novemberxc2xa02 two more fatalities were confirmed on the island{40]other caribbean islands{edit]tropical storm tomas reorganizing over the caribbean sea on novemberxc2xa04while passing the windward islands into the caribbean sea tomas produced strong winds and heavy rainfall on isla aves located off the northern coast of venezuela{27]although the storm did not directly strike the abc islands one of its outer rainbands stalled over the region and intensified during the night of novemberxc2xa01 to novemberxc2xa02 curaxc3xa7ao experienced its most extreme rain event in 40xc2xa0years; as many as 104 inches (265xc2xa0mm) were recorded over a 24-hour period in the eastern part of the island{41] the majority of the rain fell overnight in a heavy downpour accompanied by a severe thunderstorm that triggered large-scale power tv and radio outages{42]{43] lightning strikes sparked three large fires in a major oil refinery in willemstad the fires inflicted severe damage to several tanks estimated at us10xc2xa0million{44] flights from curaxc3xa7ao international airport were delayed due to the hazardous conditions{45]following hours of heavy rainfall widespread floods made most roads in the region impassable with dozens of cars swept away or stranded{42] the rains filled dams and overwhelmed drains causing them to overflow and exacerbating the flooding{46] the towns of salixc3xb1a brievengat and mahaai were among the hardest hit; hundreds of homes gardens and businesses were inundated{42]{47] at the height of the rainstorm a rescue worker assisting in the evacuation of a hospital was killed by the collapse of a wall an elderly man suffering a heart attack drowned while unable to exit his flooded car{48] overall curaxc3xa7ao suffered some of its worst flooding in history; insured losses across the island exceeded naxc6x92110xc2xa0million (us63xc2xa0million) though total damage costs from tomas were estimated at naxc6x92200xc2xa0million (us115xc2xa0million){49]damage on the other two islands was much more limited parts of bonaire experienced heavy but brief periods of rain with a maximum of 3xc2xa0inches (75xc2xa0mm) at flamingo international airport causing localized flooding of property on aruba some thunder and moderate rainfall occurred without significant consequences{41] all schools across the islands were closed on november 2 and 3 as a result of the storm{50]greater antilles{edit]flooding from tomas in port-au-prince haiti on novemberxc2xa06after days of anticipation tomas arrived just offshore in haiti on the morning of novemberxc2xa05 the storm intensified while brushing the disaster-weary nation reattaining hurricane strength near the westernmost tip of haiti torrential rains and tropical storm force winds buffeted the entire region within hours of the storm's arrival flooding began to occur in earthquake-ravaged port-au-prince one of the largest refugee camps set up near the ruins of the capitol building was flooded following heavy rains{51] by the evening of novemberxc2xa08 20 people had been confirmed dead 7 others were listed as missing and more than 30000 people were in shelters{52] health workers also feared damage related to tomas on the island could exacerbate the ongoing cholera outbreak{53]{54]{55]hurricane tomas as it tracks across the greater antilles on novemberxc2xa05tomas passed just to the east of cuba hours later but no significant damage was reported on the island{56] as the outer bands of hurricane tomas began to impact cuba aero caribbean flight 883 an atr-72-212 aircraft crashed near the town of guasimal in sancti spxc3xadritus province all 68 people on board the plane were killed on impact although the plane was the last to leave the airport in santiago de cuba before it closed due to tomas it is unknown what role if any the storm played in the crash{57]{58] following a review of the crash it was determined that severe ice accumulation at an altitude of 20000xc2xa0ft (6100xc2xa0m) along with errors by the crew caused the incident{59]elsewhere{edit]hurricane tomas narrowly missed the turks and caicos sparing the islands a direct hit and causing only minor flooding{60]aftermath{edit]estimates place the cost of damage in barbados at bds17xc2xa0million (us85xc2xa0million){61] throughout the northern part of st vincent the entire banana crop was lost press reports from the prime minister revealed that nearly every banana tree had been downed during the storm the country's banana crop is a major source of income and jobs accounting for roughly 60 of the workforce and 50 of the merchandise exported{62]damage from the storm on trinidad and tobago amounted to tt4xc2xa0million (us629000){63] losses in barbados reached bds17xc2xa0million (us84xc2xa0million){64] the government of st lucia stated that damage from the storm could exceed us100xc2xa0million{65] by novemberxc2xa05 the prime minister stated that damage from tomas was roughly ec13xc2xa0billion (500xc2xa0million usd) five times higher than initially stated{66]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdue to the extent of damage across the caribbean the name tomas was retired on march 16 2011 by the world meteorological organization during their 33rd hurricane committee and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with tobias for the 2016 hurricane season{67] however the name was unused in
