history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon august 29 a tropical wave exited the west coast of africa near dakar that day it is estimated a tropical depression developed along the wave southeast of cape verde there was a lack of data for several days but it is estimated that the system gradually intensified on septemberxc2xa02 ships in the region suggested there was a tropical storm after reporting winds of over 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) that day the hurricane hunters flew into the system and observed a well-defined eye along with winds of 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh){2] based on the data the united states weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico initiated advisories on hurricane donna at 2200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa02{3] about 700 miles (1100xc2xa0km) east of the lesser antilles{4] it is estimated that the storm attained hurricane status a day prior the azores high to the north was unusually powerful which caused donna to move to the west-northwest{2] when advisories began donna was a major hurricane which is the equivalent of a categoryxc2xa03 or higher on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale; it would ultimately maintain this status for nine days{5]continuing to the west-northwest donna strengthened further and on septemberxc2xa04 donna reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){1] (it was reported at the time as 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) by the weather bureau{6]) after maintaining peak winds for about 12xc2xa0hours the hurricane weakened slightly as it approached the lesser antilles{5] late on septemberxc2xa04 the eye of donna moved over barbuda saint barthxc3xa9lemy saint martin and anguilla and passed just south of anegada despite having weakened donna remained well-organized described in the monthly weather review as akin to "an intense idealized hurricane" a weakening trough to the north turned the hurricane more northwesterly bringing it within 85 miles (137xc2xa0km) of the north coast of puerto rico by septemberxc2xa07 donna had turned more to the west after the ridge built to the north over the next few days the intense hurricane moved slowly through the southern bahamas without defined steering currents and the eye passed near or over mayaguana acklins fortune island and ragged island{2]while passing through the straits of florida donna brushed the northern coast of cuba on septemberxc2xa09 with gale-force winds subsequently a cold front moved eastward through the united states and weakened the ridge causing the hurricane to turn more to the northwest it re-intensified over warm sea surface temperatures{2] and the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure dropped to 932xc2xa0mbar (275xc2xa0inhg) on septemberxc2xa010{5] between 0200 and 0300xc2xa0utc that day the 21-mile-wide (34xc2xa0km) eye of donna crossed through the florida keys just northeast of marathon with sustained winds of 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) and gusts to 178xc2xa0mph (286xc2xa0kmh) the hurricane continued to the northwest along the southwest coast of florida passing over naples and fort myers before turning inland to the northeast at 0800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa011 donna exited daytona beach into the western atlantic with winds of about 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) still as an organized hurricane accelerating to the northeast due to an approaching trough the hurricane re-intensified slightly before making landfall near wilmington north carolina early on septemberxc2xa012 at 0900xc2xa0utc that day donna again emerged over open waters near virginia although it had weakened and the eye expanded to over 50 miles (80xc2xa0km) in diameter late on septemberxc2xa012 the hurricane made landfall in westhampton new york and crossed long island later moving into new england{2] on septemberxc2xa013 donna became extratropical over northern maine before entering eastern canada having become associated with the approaching cold front after moving across quebec and labrador donna reached the labrador sea and dissipated early on

fruit was blown out of trees widespread telephone and power outages were reported{27] the strong southwest winds associated with donna in combination with very little rainfall led to a significant deposit of salt spray which whitewashed southwest-facing windows many trees and shrubs saw their leaves brown due to the salt{40] however in other areas 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150xc2xa0mm) of precipitation fell causing some washouts and local flooding waves along the coast ripped small boats and pleasure craft from their moorings and subsequently smashed them against rocks or seawalls{27]in vermont winds damaged trees tree branches and power lines causing telephone and electrical service outages in a few communities rainfall totals ranged 2xe2x80x935 inches

into new brunswick quebec and then labrador wind gusts of 53xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) in quebec snapped electrical poles and trees one death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack when his home was threatened by a fire additionally weather-related traffic accidents in the province resulted in two injuries{42]depictions in popular culture{edit]nobel prize-winner john steinbeck wrote about hurricane donna in his 1962 non-fiction memoir travels with charley: in search of america steinbeck had had a truck fitted with a custom camper-shell for a journey he intended to take across the united states accompanied by his poodle charley he planned on leaving after labor day from his home in sag harbor long island new york steinbeck delayed his trip slightly due to donna which made a direct hit on long island steinbeck wrote of saving his boat during the middle of the hurricane during which he jumped into the water and was blown to shore clinging to a fallen branch driven by the high winds it was an exploit which foreshadowed his fearless or even reckless state of mind to dive into the unknown{43]the winds of donna can be seen in the feature film blast of silence (1961); a fist fight scene on long island had been previously scheduled and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane{44]aftermath records and retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesfollowing the storm president of the united states dwight d eisenhower issued a disaster declaration for florida and north carolina allowing residents of those states to be eligible for public assistance{45]{46]the united states military sent a plane carrying doctors and food from patrick air force base to mayaguana in the bahamas{22] crews of doctors and workers with food and supplies left from key west and miami to traverse the florida keys bringing aid to affected residents{13] in marathon a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by christmas{47]coral reefs were damaged in the key largo national marine sanctuary by the hurricane{48] donna caused a significant negative impact on aquatic life in north florida bay marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about 60 miles (97xc2xa0km) offshore where they were subsequently captured by fishermen{49] a caspian tern was swept up the north american coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds to nova scotia which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by digby neck{50]because of its devastating impacts and the high mortality associated with the hurricane the name "donna" was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane; the name was replaced by "dora" in 1964{51]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalhurricane irmaxe2x80x93 another intense hurricane with a similar track in floridahurricane charley
