b'atmospheric sounding - wikipedia atmospheric soundingfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchan atmospheric sounding is a measurement of vertical distribution of physical properties of the atmospheric column such as pressure temperature wind speed and wind direction (thus deriving wind shear) liquid water content ozone concentration pollution and other properties such measurements are performed in a variety of ways including remote sensing and in situ observationsthe most common in situ sounding is a radiosonde which usually is a weather balloon but can also be a rocketsonderemote sensing soundings generally use passive infrared and microwave radiometers:airborne instrumentssurface stationsearth-observing satellite instruments such as airs and amsuobservation

barometers and humidity sensors can be sent aloft on balloons rockets or dropsondes they can also be carried on the outer hulls of ships and aircraft or even mounted on towers in this case all that is needed to capture the measurements are storage devices andor transpondersindirect methods{edit]the more challenging case involves sensors primarily satellite-mounted such as radiometers optical sensors radar lidar and ceilometer as well as sodar since these cannot measure the quantity of interest such as temperature pressure humidity etc directly by understanding emission and absorption processes we can figure out what the instrument is looking at between the layers of atmosphere while this type of instrument can also be operated from ground stations or vehiclesxe2x80x94optical methods can also be used inside in situ instrumentsxe2x80x94satellite instruments are particularly important because of their extensive regular coverage the amsu instruments on three noaa and two eumetsat satellites for instance can sample the entire globe at better than one degree resolution in less than a daywe can distinguish between two broad classes of sensor: active such as radar that have their own source and passive that only detect what is already there there can be a variety of sources for a passive instrument including scattered radiation light emitted directly from the sun moon or starsxe2x80x94both more appropriate in the visual or ultra-violet rangexe2x80x94as well light emitted from warm objects which is more appropriate in the microwave and infraredviewing geometry{edit]a limb sounder looks at the edge of the atmosphere where it is visible above the earth it does this in one of two ways: either it tracks the sun moon a star or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets occultated behind the earth or it looks towards empty space collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources in contrast a nadir-looking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface the sciamachy instrument operates in all three of these modesatmospheric inverse problem{edit]statement of the problem{edit]the following applies mainly to passive sensors but has some applicability to active sensorstypically there is a vector of values of the quantity to be retrieved xxe2x86x92{displaystyle {vec {x}}} called the state vector and a vector of measurements yxe2x86x92{displaystyle {vec {y}}} the state vector could be temperatures ozone number densities humidities etc the measurement vector is typically counts radiances or brightness temperatures from a radiometer or similar detector but could include any other quantity germain to the problem the forward model maps the state vector to the measurement vector:yxe2x86x92=fxe2x86x92(xxe2x86x92){displaystyle {vec {y}}={vec {f}}({vec {x}})}usually the mapping fxe2x86x92{displaystyle {vec {f}}} is known from physical first principles but this may not always be the case instead it may only be known empirically by matching actual measurements with actual states satellite and many other remote sensing instruments do not measure the relevant physical properties that is the state but rather the amount of radiation emitted in a particular direction at a particular frequency it is usually easy to go from the state space to the measurement spacexe2x80x94for instance with beer's law or radiative transferxe2x80x94but not the other way around therefore we need some method of inverting fxe2x86x92{displaystyle {vec {f}}} or of finding the inverse model fxe2x86x92xe2x88x921{displaystyle {vec {f}}^{-1}}methods of solution{edit]if the problem is linear we can use some type of matrix inverse methodxe2x80x94often the problem is ill-posed or unstable so we will need to regularize it: good simple methods include the normal equation or singular value decomposition if the problem is weakly nonlinear an iterative method such newton-raphson may be appropriatesometimes the physics is too complicated to model accurately or the forward model too slow to be used effectively in the inverse method in this case statistical or machine learning methods such as linear regression neural networks statistical classification kernel estimation etc can be used to form an inverse model based on a collection of ordered pairs of samples mapping the state space to the measurement space that is {xxe2x86x92:yxe2x86x92}{displaystyle lbrace {vec {x}}:{vec {y}}rbrace } these can be generated either from modelsxe2x80x94eg state vectors from dynamical models and measurement vectors from radiative transfer or similar forward modelsxe2x80x94or from direct empirical measurement other times when a statistical method might be more appropriate include
