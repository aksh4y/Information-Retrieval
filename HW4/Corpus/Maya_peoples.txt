englishreligionchristianity and maya religionthe maya people (sometimes mayans) are a group of indigenous peoples of mesoamerica they inhabit southern mexico guatemala belize el salvador and honduras the overarching term "maya" is a collective designation to include the peoples of the region that share some degree of cultural and linguistic heritage; however the term embraces many distinct populations societies and ethnic groups that each have their own particular traditions cultures and historical identitythe pre-columbian maya population was approximately eight million{3] there were an estimated seven million maya living in this area at the start of the 21st century{1]{2] guatemala southern mexico and the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula belize el salvador and western honduras have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage some are quite integrated into the majority hispanicized mestizo cultures of the nations in which they reside while others continue a more traditional culturally distinct life often speaking one of the mayan languages as a primary languagethe largest populations of contemporary maya inhabit guatemala belize and the western portions

conquest of the mayayucatxc3xa1nchiapasguatemalapetxc3xa9nvteone of the largest groups of modern maya can be found in mexico's yucatxc3xa1n state and the neighboring states of campeche quintana roo and in belize these peoples commonly identify themselves simply as "maya" with no further ethnic subdivision (unlike in the highlands of western guatemala) they speak the language which anthropologists term "yucatec maya" but is identified by speakers and yucatecos simply as "maya" among maya speakers spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first languagethere is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to usexe2x80x94maya or mayanxe2x80x94and the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre-columbian peoples to maya peoples in

katun when the maya men ceased to be called maya {and] were called christians"xe2x80x9cxe2x80x9dchilam balam chumayel{4]linguists refer to the maya language as yucatec or yucatec maya to distinguish it from other mayan languages this norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called yucatec maya; that term refers only to the language and the correct name for the people is simply maya (not mayans) maya is one language in the mayan language family thus to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language family{5] confusion of the term mayamayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not maya{6]persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that juan castillo cocom refers to as "ethnoexodus"xe2x80x94meaning that ethnic self-identification as maya is quite variable situational and articulated not to processes of producing group identity but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization{7]{8]the yucatxc3xa1n's indigenous population was first exposed to europeans after a party of spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511 one of the sailors gonzalo guerrero is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family; he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day chetumal later spanish expeditions to the region were led by cxc3xb3rdoba in 1517 grijalva in 1518 and cortxc3xa9s in 1519 from 1528 to 1540 several attempts by francisco montejo to conquer the yucatxc3xa1n failed his son francisco de montejo the younger fared almost as badly when he first took over: while desperately holding out at chichen itza he lost 150 men in a single day{9] european diseases massive recruitment of native warriors from campeche and champoton and internal hatred between the xiu maya and the lords of cocom eventually turned the tide for montejo the younger chichen itza was conquered by 1570{9] in 1542 the western yucatxc3xa1n peninsula also surrendered to himchichen itza's el castillohistorically the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with hispanic culture than the western half in the 21st century in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula (mexican states of campeche yucatxc3xa1n and quintana roo) between 750000 and 1200000 people speak mayan however three times more than that are of maya origins hold ancient maya surnames and do not speak mayan languages as their first languagematthew restall in his book the maya conquistador{10] mentions a series of letters sent to the king of spain in the 16th and 17th centuries the noble maya families at that time signed documents to the spanish royal family; surnames mentioned in those letters are pech camal xiu ucan canul cocom and tun among othersa large 19th-century revolt by the native maya people of yucatxc3xa1n (mexico) known as the caste war of yucatxc3xa1n was one of the most successful modern native american revolts{11] for a period the maya state of chan santa cruz was recognized as an independent nation by the british empire particularly in terms of trading with british hondurasdr francisco luna kan is a maya having the very common surname "kan"francisco luna-kan was elected governor of the state of yucatxc3xa1n from 1976 to 1982 luna-kan was born in mxc3xa9rida yucatxc3xa1n and he was a doctor of medicine then a professor of medicine before his political offices he was first appointed as overseer of the state's rural medical system he was the first governor of the modern yucatxc3xa1n peninsula to be of full maya ancestry in the early 21st century dozens of politicians including deputies majors and senators are of full or mixed maya heritage from the yucatxc3xa1n peninsulamaya family from yucatxc3xa1naccording to the national institute of geography and informatics (mexico's inegi) in yucatxc3xa1n state there were 12 million mayan speakers in 2009 representing 595 of the inhabitants{12] due to this the cultural section of the government of yucatxc3xa1n began on-line classes for grammar and proper pronunciation of maya{13]maya people from yucatxc3xa1n peninsula living in the united states of america have been organizing maya language lessons and maya cooking classes since 2003 in california and other states: clubs of yucatec maya{14] are registered in dallas and irving texas; salt lake city in utah; las vegas nevada; and california with groups in san francisco san rafael chino pasadena santa ana garden grove inglewood los angeles thousand oaks oxnard san fernando valley and whittier{14]chiapas{edit]maya populations in chiapas the area officially assigned to the lacandon community is the montes azules biosphere reserve which partly overlaps with the tzeltal tojolabal and ch'ol areaschiapas was for many years one of the regions of mexico that was least touched by the reforms of the mexican revolution the zapatista army of national liberation launched a rebellion against the mexican state chiapas in january 1994 declared itself to be an indigenous movement and drew its strongest and earliest support from chiapan maya today its number of supporters is relevant (see also the ezln and the chiapas conflict)maya groups in chiapas include the tzotzil and tzeltal in the highlands of the state the tojolabalis concentrated in the lowlands around las margaritas and the ch'ol in the jungle (see map)the most traditional of maya groups are the lacandon a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the lacandon jungle these lacandon maya came from the campechepetxc3xa9n area (north-east of chiapas) and moved into the lacandon rain-forest at the end of the 18th centuryin the course of the 20th century and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s other people (mainly the maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands) also entered into the lacandon region; initially encouraged by the government this immigration led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest to halt the migration the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614000 hectares or 6140xc2xa0km2) a protected area: the montes azules biosphere reserve they appointed only one small population group (the 66 lacandon families) as tenants (thus creating the lacandon community) thereby displacing 2000 tzeltal and ch'ol families from 26 communities and leaving non-lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land in the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control using land distribution as a political tool; as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups this strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region(see also the chiapas conflict and the lacandon jungle)belize{edit]this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it (january 2012)the maya population in belize is concentrated in the corozal cayo toledo and orange walk districts but they are scattered throughout the country the maya are thought to have been in belize and the yucatxc3xa1n region since the second millennium bc much of belize's original maya population died as a result of new infectious diseases and conflicts between tribes and with europeans they are divided into the yucatec kekchi and mopan these three maya groups now inhabit the countrythe yucatec maya (many of whom came from yucatxc3xa1n mexico to escape the caste war of the 1840s) there have been evidence of several yucatec maya groups living by the yalbac area of belize and in the orange walk district near the present day lamanai at the time the british reach the mopan (indigenous to belize but were forced out by the british; they returned from guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century) and kek'chi (also fled from slavery in guatemala in the 19th century) the later groups are chiefly found in the toledo district{15]tabasco{edit]this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it (january 2012)the mexican state of tabasco is home to the chontal mayaguatemala{edit]ixil women in nebaj guatemalain guatemala indigenous people of maya descent comprise around 40 of the population{16] the largest and most traditional maya populations are in the western highlands in the departments of baja verapaz quichxc3xa9 totonicapxc3xa1n huehuetenango quetzaltenango and san marcos; their inhabitants are mostly maya{17]the maya people of the guatemala highlands include the achi akatek chuj ixil jakaltek kaqchikel k'iche' mam poqomam poqomchi' q'anjob'al q'eqchi' tz'utujil and uspantekthe q'eqchi' live in lowland areas of alta vera paz peten and western belize over the course of the succeeding centuries a series of land displacements re-settlements persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of q'eqchi' communities into other regions of guatemala (izabal petxc3xa9n el quichxc3xa9) they are the 2nd largest ethnic maya group in guatemala (after the k'iche') and one of the largest and most widespread throughout central americain guatemala the spanish colonial pattern of keeping the native population legally separate and subservient continued well into the 20th century{citation needed] this resulted in many traditional customs being retained as the only other option than traditional maya life open to most maya was entering the hispanic culture at the very bottom rung because of this many guatemalan maya especially women continue to wear traditional clothing that varies according to their specific local identitythe southeastern region of guatemala (bordering with honduras) includes groups such as the ch'orti' the northern lowland petxc3xa9n region includes the itza whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry practices including use of dietary and medicinal plants may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the maya lowlands{18]genocide in guatemala{edit]main article: guatemalan genocideduring the 1980s the indigenous maya community made up about two-thirds of guatemalaxe2x80x99s 10 million people{19] during his presidency (1982xe2x80x931983) efraxc3xadn rxc3xados montt instituted a campaign of state terror intended to destroy the mayas in the name of countering xe2x80x9ccommunist subversionxe2x80x9d and ridding the country of its indigenous culture{citation needed]in some areas government forces killed about 40 of the total population; the campaign destroyed at least 440 mayan villages the army attacked inhabitants and burned down their homes and fields{20]the 36 year long guatemalan civil war left more than 200000 people dead and at least 100000 women raped; most of the victims were maya{21]on january 26 2012 former president rxc3xados montt was formally indicted in guatemala and appeared in court for genocide and crimes against humanity{citation needed] for which he was then sentenced to a sentence of 80 years in prison on may 10 2013{22] this ruling was overturned by the constitutional court on may 20 2013 over alleged irregularities in the handling of the case{23]{24] the ex-president appeared in court again on january 5 2015 amongst protest form his lawyers regarding his health conditions{25] and on august 25 2015 it was deliberated that a re-trial of the 2013 proceedings could find rxc3xados montt guilty or not but that the sentence would be suspended{26]{27]maya heritage{edit]this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by

each village has its own distinctive pattern making it possible to distinguish a person's home town women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirtthe maya religion is roman catholicism combined with the indigenous maya religion to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions prior to 2010s of "orthodoxing" the western rural areas by christian orthodox missionaries beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960s however protestant pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of guatemala city and other urban centers later to 2010s that almost of all maya of several rural areas of west guatemala living rural areas were mostly mass converted from catholicism or possibly maya religion due of various reasons to either eastern or oriental orthodoxy by late fr andres giron and some other orthodox missionaries and also smaller to mid-sized towns also slowly converted as well since 2013{28] the unique religion is reflected in the local saint maximxc3xb3n who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution always depicted in black he wears a black hat and sits on a chair often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand with offerings of tobacco alcohol and coca-cola at his feet the locals know him as san simon of guatemalamaximxc3xb3n a maya deitythe popol vuh is the most significant work of guatemalan literature in the k'iche' language and one of the most important of pre-columbian american literature it is a compendium of maya stories and legends aimed to preserve maya traditions the first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in quichxc3xa9 transcribed in latin characters it was translated into spanish by the dominican priest francisco ximxc3xa9nez in the beginning of the 18th century due to its combination of historical mythical and religious elements it has been called the maya bible it is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-columbian america the rabinal achxc3xad is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented it is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the toj k'iche' rulers of rabinal and their relationships with neighboring k'iche' of q'umarkaj{29] the rabinal achxc3xad is performed during the rabinal festival of january 25 the day of saint paul it was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by unesco in 2005 the 16th century saw the first native-born guatemalan writers that wrote in spanishmaya cultural heritage tourism{edit]play mediaa boy playing maya trumpet opposite of palacio nacional mexico city mexicothere is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture{30]global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change{31] estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance{32] in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building{33]with this type of tourism people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings{34]an example of this can be seen in xe2x80x9cmayanizing tourism on roatan island honduras: archaeological perspectives on heritage development and indignityxe2x80x9d alejandro j figueroa et al combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly xe2x80x9cmayanizedxe2x80x9d over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non-maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups{35]notable maya people{edit]see also: category:maya peopleah ahaual a 7th-century captive of noble lineage recorded in pre-columbian
