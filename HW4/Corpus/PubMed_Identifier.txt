centerunited states national library of medicine (nlm)release datejanuary 1996accesswebsitewwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedpubmed is a free search engine accessing primarily the medline database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics the united states national library of medicine (nlm) at the national institutes of health maintains the database as part of the entrez system of information retrievalfrom 1971 to 1997 medline online access to the medlars online computerized database primarily had been through institutional facilities such as university libraries pubmed first released in january 1996 ushered in the era of private free home- and office-based medline searching{1] the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997 when medline searches via the web were demonstrated in a ceremony by vice president al gore{2]contents1 content2 characteristics21 standard searches22 comprehensive searches23 journal article parameters231 publication type: clinical

alternative interfaces4 data mining of pubmed from programming environments5 see also6 references7 external linkscontent{edit]in addition to medline pubmed provides access to:older references from the print version of index medicus back to 1951 and earlierreferences to some journals before they were indexed in index medicus and medline for instance science bmj and annals of surgeryvery recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with medical subject headings (mesh) and added to medlinea collection of books available full-text and other subsets of nlm records{3]pmc citationsncbi bookshelfmany pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central{4] and local mirrors such as uk pubmed central{5]information about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalog{6]as of 11 july 2017{update] pubmed has more than 273 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809; about 500000 new records are added each year as of the same date{update] 131 million of pubmed's records are listed with their abstracts and 142 million articles have links to full-text (of which 38 million articles are available full-text for free for any user){7] approximately 12 of the records in pubmed correspond to cancer-related entries which have grown from 6 in the 1950s to 16 in 2016{8] other significant proportion of records correspond to xe2x80x9cchemistryxe2x80x9d (869) xe2x80x9ctherapyxe2x80x9d (839) and "infection" (5)in 2016 nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articles{9]characteristics{edit]standard searches{edit]simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmed's search windowpubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh (medical subject headings) terms synonyms boolean operators and 'nests' the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining (using the or operator) textwords and mesh termsthe examples given in a pubmed tutorial{10] demonstrate how this automatic process works:causes sleep walking is translated as ("etiology"{subheading] or "etiology"{all fields] or "causes"{all fields] or "causality"{mesh terms] or "causality"{all fields]) and ("somnambulism"{mesh terms] or "somnambulism"{all fields] or ("sleep"{all fields] and "walking"{all fields]) or "sleep walking"{all fields])likewiseheart attack aspirin prevention is translated as ("myocardial infarction"{mesh terms] or ("myocardial"{all fields] and "infarction"{all fields]) or "myocardial infarction"{all fields] or ("heart"{all fields] and "attack"{all fields]) or "heart attack"{all fields]) and ("aspirin"{mesh terms] or "aspirin"{all fields]) and ("prevention and control"{subheading] or ("prevention"{all fields] and "control"{all fields]) or "prevention and control"{all fields] or "prevention"{all fields])a new pubmed interface was launched in october 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick google-like search formulations; they have also been described as 'telegram' searches{11] by default the results are sorted by most recent but this changed to best match publication date first author last author journal or title{12]comprehensive searches{edit]for optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to understand its core component medline and especially of the mesh (medical subject headings) controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names (tags) proper use of limits and other features; reference librarians and search specialists offer search services{13]{14]journal article parameters{edit]when a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are: article type (mesh terms eg "clinical trial") secondary identifiers (mesh terms) language country of the journal or publication history (e-publication date print journal publication date)publication type: clinical queriessystematic reviews{edit]publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication including reports of various kinds of clinical research{15]secondary id{edit]since july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier (si) the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries: clinicaltrialsgov (nct identifier) and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register (irctn identifier){16]see also{edit]a reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and "related articles" can be identified if relevant several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated (on pubmed or any of the other ncbi entrez databases) using the 'find related data' option the related articles are then listed in order of "relatedness" to create these lists of related articles pubmed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation as well as the mesh headings assigned using a powerful word-weighted algorithm{17] the 'related articles' function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search{18]mapping to mesh headings and subheadings{edit]pubmed automatically links to mesh terms and subheadings examples would be: "bad breath" links to (and includes in the search) "halitosis" "heart attack" to "myocardial infarction" "breast cancer" to "breast neoplasms" where appropriate these mesh terms are automatically "expanded" that is include more specific terms terms like "nursing" are automatically linked to "nursing {mesh]" or "nursing {subheading]" this feature is called auto term mapping and is enacted by default in free text searching but not exact phrase searching (ie enclosing the search query with double quotes){19] this feature makes pubmed searches more sensitive and avoids false-negative (missed) hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology{19]my ncbi{edit]the pubmed optional facility "my ncbi" (with free registration) provides tools forsaving searchesfiltering search resultssetting up automatic updates sent by e-mailsaving sets of references retrieved as part of a pubmed searchconfiguring display formats or highlighting search termsand a wide range of other options{20] the "my ncbi" area can be accessed from any computer with web-access an earlier version of "my ncbi" was called "pubmed cubby"{21]linkout{edit]linkout a nlm facility to link (and make available full-text) local journal holdings{22] some 3200 sites (mainly academic institutions) participate in this nlm facility (as of march 2010{update]) from aalborg university in denmark to zymogenetics in seattle{23] users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the pubmed search result (if the journal is held at that institution) and can access the full-textpubmed commons{edit]in 2016 pubmed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by pubmed this feature was initially tested in a pilot mode (since 2013) and was made permanent in 2016{24]pubmed for handheldsmobiles{edit]pubmedmedline can be accessed via handheld devices using for instance the "pico" option (for focused clinical questions) created by the nlm{25] a "pubmed mobile" option providing access to a mobile friendly simplified pubmed version is also available{26]askmedline{edit]askmedline a free-text natural language query tool for medlinepubmed developed by the nlm also suitable for handhelds{27]pubmed identifier{edit]for help using pubmed identifiers within wikipedia see wikipedia:pmida pmid (pubmed identifier or pubmed unique identifier){28] is a unique integer value starting at 1 assigned to each pubmed record a pmid is not the same as a pmcid which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access pubmed central{29]the assignment of a pmid or pmcid to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content pmids are assigned to letters to the editor editorial opinions op-ed columns and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal as well as peer-reviewed papers the existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud incompetence or misconduct the announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a pmidalternative interfaces{edit]medline is one of the databases which are accessible via pubmed several companies provide access to medline through their platformsthe national library of medicine leases the medline information to a number of private vendors such as embase ovid dialog ebsco knowledge finder and many other commercial non-commercial and academic providers{30] as of october 2008{update] more than 500 licenses had been issued more than 200 of them to providers outside the united states as licenses to use medline data are available for free the nlm in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range{31] of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to pubmed one of a very few large professionally curated databases which offers this optionlu{31] identifies a sample of 28 current and free web-based pubmed versions requiring no installation or registration which are grouped into four categories:ranking search results for instance: etblast; hakia; medlineranker;{32] misearch;{33]clustering results by topics authors journals etc for instance: anne o'tate;{34] clustermed;{35]enhancing semantics and visualization for instance: ebimed;{36] medevi;{37] scicurve (note: citexplore was withdrawn from service on 15 february 2013{38] replaced by europe pubmed central{39])improved search interface and retrieval experience for instance askmedline{40]{41] babelmesh;{42] and pubcrawler{43]gopubmed is a knowledge-based (gene ontology and mesh) search engine for pubmed gopubmed claims to be a semantic search engine but searches return exactly the same results as pubmed itselfexpertscape provides search and ranking of medical and biomedical expertise by specific diagnosis technique or other terminology results are based on analysis derived from most recent ten years of pubmed data{44]search term forwarders like "ossipubmed online" o grothxc2xa0 which runs searches on multiple external platforms derived from the original boolean search termsreference-to-pubmed transcriptors like "ossipubmed online" o grothxc2xa0 which retrieves the pmid from one-letter coded journal abbreviations to get the full-text articleslink-out arborizers "ossipubmed online" o grothxc2xa0 which tries to retrieve available pdf's from additional hostsas most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on pubmedmedline data leased under license from the nlmpubmed the term "pubmed derivatives" has been suggested{31] without the need to store about 90xc2xa0gb of original pubmed datasets anybody can write pubmed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in "the e-utilities in-depth: parameters syntax and more" by eric sayers phd{45]data mining of pubmed from programming environments{edit]alternative methods to mine the data in pubmed use programming environments such as matlab python or r in these cases queries of pubmed are written as lines of code and passed to pubmed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment code can be automated to systematically queries with different keywords such as disease year organs etc a recent publication (2017) found that the proportion of cancer-related entries in pubmed has rise from 6 in the 1950s to 16 in 2016{46]see
