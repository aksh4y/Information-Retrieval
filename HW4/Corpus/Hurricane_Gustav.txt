jamaica the cayman islands cuba and the united states gustav caused at least 66xc2xa0billion (2008xc2xa0usd) in damages{1]it formed on the morning of august 25 2008 about 260 miles (420xc2xa0km) southeast of port-au-prince haiti and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on august 26 later that day it made landfall near the haitian town of jacmel it inundated jamaica and ravaged western cuba and then steadily moved across the gulf of mexico{2]{3]once into the gulf gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air it weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on august 31 and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of september 1 near cocodrie louisiana{4] weakening continued and gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central us the weak system became extratropical on september 4 and was absorbed by another low on september 5{4]in total an estimated 153 deaths had been attributed to gustav in the us and caribbean damage in the us totaled to 43xc2xa0billion (2008xc2xa0usd){5] with additional damage of

plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalegustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the lesser antilles it developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature the nhc designated it tropical depression seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system{8] at the time the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant{8]{9] and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm which was soon designated tropical storm gustav{10] a brief period of disorganization{11] proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night{12] in the early hours of august 26 as the storm approached haiti's southwestern peninsula{13] another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspectedxe2x80x94that gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh){14] before reaching haiti its satellite presentation continued to intensify a central dense overcast became more prominent{15] and the minimum central pressure fell{16]hurricane gustav making landfall in haiti on august 25hurricane gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on haiti with 75xc2xa0mph (121xc2xa0kmh) winds{17] near the town of jacmel{18] as the hurricane moved over haiti's mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted{17] and it lost a little strength{19] although downgraded to a tropical storm it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures its outflow improved throughout the night of august 26{20] and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the gulf of gonxc3xa2ve{21] however the storm's movement slowed and continued interaction with nearby haiti combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast resulted in further weakening during the day on august 27{22]{23] the storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to jamaica on the morning of august 28 it was found that overnight gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought the storm was also found to have restrengthened nearly to hurricane status{24] it then was upgraded to a hurricane again during the late afternoon of august 29 at 11:00 am edt (1500xc2xa0utc) on august 30 as gustav neared the west end of cuba it was upgraded to a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{25] with sustained winds near 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh){25] gustav continued its rapid deepening trend and three hours later it had already reached categoryxc2xa04 strength gustav's maximum sustained winds had reached 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh){26] with a minimum pressure of 941xc2xa0millibars{27]on august 30 gustav made landfall twice on cuba: first on isla de la juventud and then on the mainland near the community of los palacios in pinar del rxc3xado province{28] by the early hours of august 31 gustav entered the gulf of mexico with maximum sustained winds of 135xc2xa0mph (217xc2xa0kmh) and minimum central pressure of 958xc2xa0millibars{29] during august 31 the storm moved in a northwest direction slightly losing its strength (despite passing over a shortened loop current) with sustained winds at 115xc2xa0mph{30] on the evening of august 31 gustav weakened to a category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall{4] gustav made landfall along the louisiana coast with 105xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh) winds near cocodrie{31] at about 9:30 am cdt (1430xc2xa0utc) by 10xc2xa0pm cdt gustav had been downgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) about 20xc2xa0miles (30xc2xa0km) southwest of alexandria louisiana{32] and by 4xc2xa0am cdt on september 2 gustav had diminished to a tropical depression with a threat of severe flooding in the lower mississippi valley and eastern texas{33]preparations{edit]hispaniola{edit]immediately upon the storm's designation as a tropical depression it was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm and strike the island of hispaniola{8] shared by the dominican republic on the east and haiti on the west tropical storm warnings were issued from the coast of the dominican republic south of santo domingo to the haitian coast south of port-au-prince a tropical storm watch was issued for the haitian coast north of port-au-prince to the northern border with the dominican republic{34] hours later when gustav was upgraded to a tropical storm the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning{35]{36]the haitian government ordered emergency shelters to prepare{37] the country is particularly vulnerable to floods and landslides as rainfall runs off its largely deforested mountains{36]{38] the government issued a red alert{38] and advised the population to take precautions but few haitians took heed fair weather led many to doubt whether a hurricane was even approaching{37] american airlines canceled all of its flights into and out of port-au-prince on august 26 stranding travelers hoping to escape the storm{37]jamaica and cayman islands{edit]hurricane

subsequent hurricanes ike and paloma is about 94xc2xa0billion (usd) with about 21xc2xa0billion of that from gustav{7]united states{edit]on august 31 the nhc predicted with 45 probability that gustav would remain at categoryxc2xa03 or above on september 1 this influenced preparations although in fact gustav had dropped just below the categoryxc2xa03 threshold to categoryxc2xa02 by landfall and categoryxc2xa01 shortly afterwardslouisiana{edit]building being boarded up in uptown new orleans august 28on the morning of august 26 with gustav still over haiti louisiana emergency preparedness

accident on interstate 20 near carrollton georgia while evacuating from louisiana two other people in the car were alive and airlifted to nearby hospitals{140]arkansas{edit]because of gustav's slow motion across northwest louisiana and arkansas on september 4 and september 5 significant rainfall accumulation was seen statewide the maximum amount in arkansas was at hamburg where 1125 inches (286xc2xa0mm) had fallen{141] making gustav the third wettest tropical cyclone to affect the state since 1972{142]political implications{edit]united states{edit]hurricane gustav was expected to make landfall near new orleans almost exactly three years after hurricane katrina struck the same region it also arrived in the midst of the campaign for the 2008 us presidential elections and during the week the 2008 republican national convention was scheduled to start the federal and state administrations as well as the candidates for the 2008 presidential election were sensitive that gustav was likely to remind us voters of the "botched response" by state and local municipalities and subsequent federal aid authorities to the earlier storm{143]on august 30 president george w bush and vice president dick cheney canceled their planned attendance at the 2008 republican national convention{144] because of the expected us landfall governors and some other political leaders from louisiana and other states chose to stay home from the 2008 republican national convention{145] as the hurricane approached the coast presumptive republican presidential nominee john mccain canceled all non-essential opening-day festivities at the convention{146] and said that he might give his acceptance speech via satellite from the affected area{147]democratic presidential nominee barack obama and vice presidential nominee joe biden monitoring the situation in the gulf coast encouraged new orleans residents to evacuate{148] obama also announced that he would ask his large network of donors and volunteers to contribute money goods and work to assist victims of the storm according to what was most needed after the storm hit{149]louisiana's congressional primary election originally scheduled for september 6 was delayed to october 4 which then delayed the general election for two races that required a runoff vote to december 6 2008{150]cuba{edit]fidel castro addressed in a "reflection" published on september 1 in the official daily granma "two days ago  out of 11 international press reports devoted to cuba none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our civil defense" castro writes instead the news services "echoing a yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against cuba" reported about the defection of tv actor yamil jaled (the "yankee press organization" appears to be an allusion to el nuevo herald which broke the news of jaled's arrival in miami) "what a patriot! what a democrat! what a brilliant example" wrote castro "this way the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than hurricane gustav they want to make a sacred cow out of him"{151]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the damage and deaths on april 22 2009 the name gustav was retired by the world meteorological organization it will never again be used to name an
