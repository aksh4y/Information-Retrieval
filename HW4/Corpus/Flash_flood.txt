that is it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood rather than trying to cross it many people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods what makes flash floods most dangerous is their sudden nature and fast-moving water a vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away; it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood more than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded intersections{4] as little as 2 feet (061xc2xa0m) of water is enough to carry away most suv-sized vehicles{5] the us national weather service reported in 2005 that using a national 30-year average more people die yearly in floods 127 on average than by lightning (73) tornadoes (65) or hurricanes (16){6]in deserts flash floods can be particularly deadly for several reasons first storms in arid regions are infrequent but they can deliver an enormous amount of water in a very short time second these rains often fall on poorly absorbent and often clay-like soil which greatly increase the amount of runoff that rivers and other water channels have to handle these regions tend not to have the infrastructure that wetter regions have to divert water from structures and roads such as storm drains culverts and retention basins either because of sparse population poverty or because residents believe the risk of flash floods is not high enough to justify the expense in fact in some areas desert roads frequently cross dry river and creek beds without bridges from the driver's perspective there may be clear weather when a river unexpectedly forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of seconds{7] finally the lack of regular rain to clear water channels may cause flash floods in deserts to be headed by large amounts of debris such as rocks branches and logsdeep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away sweeps through the canyon and makes it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the floodsignificant examples{edit]main article: list of flash floods1889: johnstown flood pennsylvania us: more than 2200 people dead1903: heppner flood of 1903;
