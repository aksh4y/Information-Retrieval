saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalehurricane sandy began as a low pressure system which developed sufficient organized convection to be classified as tropical depression eighteen on octoberxc2xa022 south of kingston jamaica{16] it moved slowly at first due to a ridge to the north low wind shear and warm waters allowed for strengthening{16] and the system was named tropical storm sandy late on octoberxc2xa022{17] early on octoberxc2xa024 an eye began developing and it was moving steadily northward due to an approaching trough{18] later that day the national hurricane center (nhc) upgraded sandy to hurricane status about 65xc2xa0mi (105xc2xa0km) south of kingston jamaica{19] at about 1900xc2xa0utc that day sandy made landfall near kingston with winds of about 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh){20] just offshore cuba sandy rapidly intensified to winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){3] and at that intensity it made landfall just west of santiago de cuba at 0525xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa025{21]play mediaa time-lapse video made from nasa satellite images of hurricane sandyafter sandy exited cuba the structure became disorganized{22] and it turned to the north-northwest over the bahamas{23] by octoberxc2xa027 sandy was no longer fully tropical and despite strong shear it maintained convection due to influence from an approaching trough; the same trough turned the hurricane to the northeast{24] after briefly weakening to a tropical storm{25] sandy re-intensified into a hurricane{26] and on octoberxc2xa028 an eye began redeveloping{27] the storm moved around an upper-level low over the eastern united states and also to the southwest of a ridge over atlantic canada turning it to the northwest{28] sandy briefly re-intensified to category 2 intensity on the morning of octoberxc2xa029 around which time it had a wind diameter of over 1150xc2xa0miles (1850xc2xa0km) and a central pressure of 943 mb which set records for many cities across the northeastern united states for the lowest pressures ever observed{29] the convection diminished while the hurricane accelerated toward the new jersey coast{30] and the hurricane was no longer tropical by 2100xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa029{31] about 2 12 hours later sandy made landfall near brigantine new jersey{32] with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh){3] during the next four days sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over ontario before merging with another low pressure area over eastern canada on november 2{3]{33]forecastson october 23 2012 the path of hurricane sandy was correctly predicted by the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts (ecmwf) headquartered in reading england nearly eight days in advance of its striking the american east coast the computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the new yorknew jersey region on october 29 rather than turn east and head out to the open atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do by october 27 four days after the ecmwf made its prediction the national weather service and national hurricane center confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the european model the national weather service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its european counterpart did a hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed{34]relation to global warmingsee also: tropical cyclones and climate changeaccording to ncar senior climatologist kevin e trenberth "the answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it is the wrong question all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be"{35] although noaa meteorologist martin hoerling attributes sandy to "little more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm"{36] trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by "natural variability" but adds that it was "enhanced by global warming"{37] one factor contributing to the storm's strength was abnormally warm sea surface temperatures offshore the east coast of the united statesxe2x80x94more than 3xc2xa0xc2xb0c (5xc2xa0xc2xb0f) above normal to which global warming had contributed 06xc2xa0xc2xb0c (1xc2xa0xc2xb0f){37] as the temperature of the atmosphere increases the capacity to hold water increases leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts{37]as they move north atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the prevailing westerlies{38] in sandy's case this typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over greenland resulting in a negative north atlantic oscillation forming a kink in the jet stream causing it to double back on itself off the east coast sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow{38] the blocking pattern over greenland also stalled an arctic front which combined with the cyclone{38] mark fischetti of scientific american said that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of arctic ice{39] trenberth said that while a negative north atlantic oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather{36] sea level at new york and along the new jersey coast has increased by nearly a foot (300 mm) over the last hundred years{40] which contributed to the storm surge{41] harvard geologist daniel p schrag calls hurricane sandy's 13-foot (4 m) storm surge an example of what will by mid-century be the "new norm on the eastern seaboard"{42]preparationscaribbean and bermudaafter the storm became a tropical cyclone on october 22 the government of jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island{43] early on

impact of hurricane sandypresident barack obama and new jersey governor chris christie talking to storm victims in brigantineplay media'chris christie on post-sandy obama meet- 'i would do it again video from msnbc in 2017 in the aftermath of hurricane harveyhurricane sandy sparked much political commentary many scientists said warming oceans and greater atmospheric moisture were intensifying storms while rising sea levels were worsening coastal effects november 2012 representative henry waxman of california the top democrat of the house energy and commerce committee requested a hearing in the lame duck session on links between climate change and hurricane sandy{306] some news outlets labeled the storm the october surprise of the 2012 united states presidential election{307]{308] while democrats and republicans accused each other of politicizing the storm{309]the storm hit the united states one week before its general united states elections and affected the presidential campaign local and state campaigns in storm-damaged areas new jersey governor chris christie one of mitt romney's leading supporters praised president barack obama and his reaction to the hurricane and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president{310] it was reported at the time that sandy might affect elections in several states especially by curtailing early voting{311] the economist wrote "{]the weather is supposed to clear up well ahead of election day but the impact could be felt in the turnout of early voters"{312] abc news predicted this might be offset by a tendency to clear roads and restore power more quickly in urban areas{313] the storm ignited a debate over whether republican presidential nominee mitt romney in 2011 proposed to eliminate the federal emergency management agency (fema){314] the next day the romney campaign promised to keep fema funded but did not explain what other parts of the federal budget it would cut to pay for it{315] beyond the election national defense magazine said sandy "might cause a rethinking (in the usa) of how climate change threatens national security"{316]in his news conference on november 14 president obama said " we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change what we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago we do know that the arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago we do know that there have been extraordinarily xe2x80x94 there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in north america but also around the globe and i am a firm believer that climate change is real that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions and as a consequence i think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it"{317]on january 30 2015 days after the us army corps of engineers released a post-sandy report examining flood risks for 31200 miles (50210 km) of the north atlantic coast president obama issued an executive order directing federal agencies state and local governments drawing federal funds to adopt stricter building and siting standards to reflect scientific projections that future flooding will be more frequent and intense due to climate change{318]financial markets impactthis section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information (march 2017)power outages and flooding in the area closed the new york stock exchange and other financial markets on both october 29 and 30 a weather-related closure that last happened in 1888{319] when markets reopened on october 31 investors were relieved that it closed relatively flat that day a week later the national association of insurance commissioners capital markets bureau noted a slight uptick in the market (08) and suggested that the negative economic impact of hurricane sandy was offset by the expected positive impacts of rebuilding{320]media coverageas hurricane sandy approached the united states forecasters and journalists gave it several different unofficial names at first related to its projected snow content then to its proximity to halloween and eventually to the overall size of the storm early nicknames included "snowicane sandy"{321] and "snor'eastercane sandy"{322]{323] the most popular halloween-related nickname was "frankenstorm"{324]{325] coined by jim cisco a forecaster at the hydrometeorological prediction center{326]{327]{328] cnn banned the use of the term saying it trivialized the destruction{329]{330]the severe and widespread damage the storm caused in the united states as well as its unusual merger with a frontal system resulted in the nicknaming of the hurricane "superstorm sandy" by the media public officials and several organizations including us government agencies{331]{332]{333]{334]{335]{336]{337] this persisted as the most common nickname well into 2013{338]{339] the term was also embraced by climate change proponents as a term for the new type of storms caused by global warming{340]{improper synthesis?] while other writers used the term but maintained that it was too soon to blame the storm on climate change{341]{342] meanwhile popular science called it "an imaginary scare-term that exists exclusively for shock value"{343]insurance fraud claimsthousands of homeowners were denied their flood insurance claims based upon fraudulent engineers' reports according to the whistleblowing efforts of andrew braum an engineer who claimed that at least 175 of his more than 180 inspections were doctored{344]{345] as a result a class-action racketeering lawsuit has been filed against several insurance companies and their contract engineering firms{346] as of 2015{update] the federal emergency management agency planned to review all flood insurance claims{347]baby boomnew jersey hospitals saw a spike in births nine months after sandy causing some to believe that there was a post-sandy baby boom the monmouth medical center saw a 35 jump and two other hospitals saw 20 increases{348] an expert stated that post-storm births that year were higher than in past disasters{349]retirement of the namesee also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the exceptional damage and deaths caused by the storm in many countries the name sandy was later retired by the world meteorological organization and will never be used again for a north atlantic hurricane the name was replaced with sara for the 2018 atlantic hurricane season{350]in popular culturein the syfy television movie sharknado 3: oh hell no! a radar image of sandy can be seen (close to its landfall in new jersey) but represented fictionally as an unnamed
