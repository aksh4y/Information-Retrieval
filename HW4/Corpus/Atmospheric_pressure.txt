is the pressure within the atmosphere of earth (or that of another planet) in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with si units of pascals (1 pa = 1 nm2) on average a column of air one square centimetre {cm2] (016xc2xa0sqxc2xa0in) in cross-section measured from sea level to the top of the earth's atmosphere has a mass of about 103 kilograms (23xc2xa0lb) and weight of about 101 newtons (23xc2xa0lbf) that weight (across one square centimeter) is a pressure of 101 ncm2 or 101xc2xa0knm2 (kpa) a column 1 square inch (65xc2xa0cm2) in cross-section would have a weight of about 147xc2xa0lb (67xc2xa0kg) or about 654xc2xa0ncontents1 mechanism2 standard atmosphere3 mean sea level pressure4 altitude variation5 local

message)atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere{citation needed] it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in composition{citation needed]standard atmosphere{edit]the standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101325xc2xa0pa (101325xc2xa0bar) equivalent to 760 mmhg (torr) 2992 inhg and 14696 psi{1]mean sea level pressure{edit]15 year average mean sea level pressure for june july and august (top) and december january and february (bottom) era-15 re-analysiskollsman-type barometric aircraft altimeter (as used in north america) displaying an altitude of 80xc2xa0ft (24xc2xa0m)the mean sea level pressure (mslp) is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressurethe altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustmentaverage sea-level pressure is 101325xc2xa0mbar (101325xc2xa0kpa; 29921xc2xa0inhg; 76000xc2xa0mmhg) in aviation weather reports (metar) qnh is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar) except in the united states canada and colombia where it is reported in inches (to two decimal places) of mercury the united states and canada also report sea level pressure slp which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars{2] however in canada's public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals{3]in the us weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: 10132xc2xa0mbar (10132xc2xa0kpa) is transmitted as 132; 10000xc2xa0mbar (10000xc2xa0kpa) is transmitted as 000; 9987 mbar is transmitted as 987; etc the highest sea-level pressure on earth occurs in siberia where the siberian high often attains a sea-level pressure above 1050xc2xa0mbar (105xc2xa0kpa; 31xc2xa0inhg) with record highs close to 1085xc2xa0mbar (1085xc2xa0kpa; 320xc2xa0inhg) the lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of tropical cyclones and tornadoes with a record low of 870xc2xa0mbar (87xc2xa0kpa; 26xc2xa0inhg) (see atmospheric pressure records)altitude

nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude{4]

studying weather and climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weatheratmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal (twice-daily) cycle caused by global atmospheric tides this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian (24xc2xa0h) cycle and semi-circadian (12xc2xa0h) cyclerecords{edit]the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth (above 750 meters) was 10857xc2xa0hpa (3206xc2xa0inhg) measured in tosontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001{5] the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded (below 750 meters) was at agata in evenk autonomous okrug russia (66xc2xb053xe2x80x99n 93xc2xb028xe2x80x99e elevation: 261xc2xa0m 856xc2xa0ft) on 31 december 1968 of 10838xc2xa0hpa (32005xc2xa0inhg){6] the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions (assuming a standard lapse rate) associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations{5]the dead sea the lowest place on earth at 430 metres (1410xc2xa0ft) below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065 hpa{7]the lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870xc2xa0hpa (0858xc2xa0atm; 2569xc2xa0inhg) set on 12 october 1979 during typhoon tip in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft{8]measurement based on depth of water{edit]one atmosphere (101xc2xa0kpa or 147xc2xa0psi) is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 103xc2xa0m (338xc2xa0ft) thus a diver 103xc2xa0m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1xc2xa0atm of air plus 1xc2xa0atm of water) conversely 103xc2xa0m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditionslow pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as wc (water column) or wg (inches water gauge) a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14xc2xa0wc which is approximately 35 hpa similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly usedboiling point of water{edit]boiling waterpure water boils at 100xc2xa0xc2xb0c (212xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at earth's standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water{9] because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes{10] a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils; in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorers{11]measurement and maps{edit]an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newton's theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland (using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of "gravity") and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter (328 feet) this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the "application of science" which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be "useful"{12]see also{edit]underwater diving portalatmosphere (unit)barometric formulabarotrauma xe2x80x93 physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between an air
