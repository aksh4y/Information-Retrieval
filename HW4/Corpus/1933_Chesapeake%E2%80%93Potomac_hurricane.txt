mid-atlantic states and thenortheastern united statespart of the 1933 atlantic hurricane seasonthe 1933 chesapeakexe2x80x93potomac hurricane{1] was among the most damaging hurricanes in the mid-atlantic states in the eastern united states the sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 atlantic hurricane season it formed in the eastern atlantic where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale{nb 1] a strong ridge over new england allowed a continued northwest course bringing the storm south of bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern united states advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall it did so in northeastern north carolina on augustxc2xa023 with winds of about 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) soon after the eye crossed over norfolk virginia the first time that happened since 1821 the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern virginia shortly before passing near washington dc becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896 curving northward the storm moved through pennsylvania and new york before losing tropical characteristics on augustxc2xa025 now extratropical the former hurricane moved across atlantic canada dissipating on augustxc2xa028across the eastern united states the hurricane left widespread damage amounting to over 40xc2xa0million (equivalent to about 52xc2xa0billion in 2016) and causing 47xc2xa0deaths{nb 2] although the storm struck north carolina damage in the state totaled only about 250000 largely to crops and transport along the chesapeake bay the storm produced 100-year flooding from its storm surge setting records that remained for over 80xc2xa0years in virginia flooding covered downtown portions of norfolk in the southeast and alexandria in the north damage in the state was estimated at 175xc2xa0million similarly heavy damage occurred in maryland including over 7xc2xa0million to crops high waves along the coast eroded beaches and created a new inlet at ocean city the highest rainfall associated with the hurricane was 1328xc2xa0in (337xc2xa0mm) at york pennsylvania in the state the rains flooded several rivers which forced thousands to evacuate in neighboring new jersey high waves wrecked boats and destroyed a fishing pier while in new york flooding caused traffic jams in atlantic canada heavy rainfall assisted firefighters in combating wildfires and the associated winds caused isolated power outagescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations and impact21 north carolina and virginia22 maryland north3 see also4 notes5 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon augustxc2xa013 a tropical depression developed near the west coast of africa southeast of cape verde with an associated closed circulation based on observations from a nearby ship it is estimated the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm while moving generally to the west-northwest for several days the storm continued this general trajectory eventually shifting more to the northwest based on interpolation of reports it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on augustxc2xa016 while halfway between africa and the lesser antilles{4] the weather bureau began tracking the system on augustxc2xa018{5] later that day a ship reported a pressure of 948xc2xa0mbar (280xc2xa0inhg) suggesting winds of 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) this made the hurricane a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale another ship report on augustxc2xa020 indicated a pressure of 940xc2xa0mbar (28xc2xa0inhg) while reporting hurricane winds suggesting peak winds of 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh){4]after remaining near peak intensity for three days the hurricane began steadily weakening while curving more to the west-northwest{4] a rare track for the region due to steering from a ridge over new england{6] on augustxc2xa021 the storm passed about 150xc2xa0mi (240xc2xa0km) southwest of bermuda at 1000xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa023 the hurricane made landfall along the northern outer banks of north carolina{4] near nags head{1] with a pressure of 963xc2xa0mbar (284xc2xa0inhg) based on the steady weakening coastal observations and a larger than normal size landfall winds were estimated at 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) a few hours later the hurricane made another landfall on the north carolina mainland after crossing the albemarle sound while the hurricane continued to the northwest the eye briefly moved over norfolk virginia{4] for the first time since the 1821 norfolk and long island hurricane{1] early on augustxc2xa024 the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm while passing near washington dc curving to the north the storm crossed pennsylvania and into new york where it weakened further into a tropical depression on augustxc2xa025 the former hurricane turned to the east near the canadaxe2x80x93us border and after interacting with a cold front became extratropical it emerged from maine and briefly re-intensified moving across southern nova scotia with gale force winds on augustxc2xa028 the circulation dissipated to the south of newfoundland{4]preparations and impact{edit]track of the 1933 hurricane across virginia and marylandthe hurricane first affected bermuda when it passed to the south winds at st george's reached 64xc2xa0mph (103xc2xa0kmh){5] high waves along the coast prevented boats from docking{7]early on augustxc2xa021 the weather bureau issued storm warnings from cape hatteras to boston massachusetts as the hurricane approached land the warnings were extended southward to southport north carolina in norfolk virginia most ships either remained at port or sought shelter due to advance warning{5] residents were advised to evacuate in ocean view virginia beach and willoughby spit{8] and about 350xc2xa0people left their houses in virginia beach{9] along the coast the united states coast guard rescued more than 200xc2xa0people many of whom due to capsized boats{6] a 1993 article published in the monthly weather review considered the storm to have been "one of the most severe storms that has ever visited the middle atlantic coast"{5] flooding affected a larger portion of the northeastern united states than any other hurricane in the 1900s after hurricane agnes in 1972{6] the federal emergency management agency later used high water levels from the storm as a 100-year event for the chesapeake bay region the next storm to approach the storm surge levels was isabel in 2003 which was lower in most locations in virginia{10] although higher in washington dc and baltimore due to sea level rise{11] this hurricane caused damage from north carolina through new jersey due to the combination of high winds and storm tides{5] and left 47xc2xa0people dead overall{6]north carolina and virginia{edit]when the hurricane made landfall in the outer banks it produced winds of 76xc2xa0mph (122xc2xa0kmh) at cape hatteras{4] the winds caused crop damage as far inland as granville county{12]the four-masted schooner ga kohler hailing from baltimore and bound for haiti was driven ashore at hatteras by the high winds across the region the storm downed power lines washed out highways wrecked boats and destroyed houses and overall damage in the state was around 250000{13]as the hurricane moved into virginia winds were as strong as 82xc2xa0mph (131xc2xa0kmh) at cape henry while norfolk reported winds of 70xc2xa0mph (113xc2xa0kmh){4] the latter city reported a record high tide of 98xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) above normal at sewell's point which flooded the downtown section with 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) of water water levels were 5 to 8xc2xa0ft (15 to 24xc2xa0m) higher than any previous high water mark in newport news and most of fort eustis was flooded in hampton the storm surge flooded langley air force base swamped homes and businesses wrecked boats and destroyed fishing piers rainfall in chesapeake reached about 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm){1] and reached about 7xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) in norfolk{5] flooding near norfolk damaged crops{1] and after its downtown section was flooded residents were forced to travel by boat when the flood levels dropped many fish were left behind in the streets{6] high water levels of around 4xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) along the york river destroyed buildings at gloucester point{1] in virginia beach the storm knocked down about 600xc2xa0trees many of them about 100xc2xa0years old and over 79000xc2xa0people lost telephone service{14]due to advance warning there was minimal damage to shipping in the region{5] however high waves damaged the steamer madison with 90xc2xa0people on board and caused it to drift off cape charles which necessitated rescue from the coast guard{9] inland flooding occurred along the james river as far west as richmond where damage was limited to downed trees and broken windows the pier of the jamestown ferry was washed out in surry and a marina at jordan point near hopewell was wrecked after the river reached the highest level on record a powerful storm surge moved up the chesapeake bay and flooded waterfront locations at colonial beach along the potomac river the surge flooded the town with 4xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) of water and wrecked a local amusement park the potomac in alexandria was at its highest level since 1899 causing floods 8xc2xa0ft (24xc2xa0m) deep along us route 1 and flooding the old town section high winds in the city caused power outages and flooding along the cameron run washed out a bridge the combination of rain and winds damaged crops in fairfax and loudoun counties mainly to corn and peaches{1] statewide the storm caused 525xc2xa0million in crop damage largely to corn and tobacco{14] damage in the state was estimated at 175xc2xa0million and there were 15xc2xa0deaths{13] after the storm about 350xc2xa0people helped clear debris from the streets of norfolk{15]maryland north{edit]farther north it is estimated the storm produced hurricane-force winds in portions of maryland{4] along the coast high waves eroded about 2xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi (52xc2xa0km2) of beaches in maryland and another 1xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi (26xc2xa0km2) in delaware{5] high waves created an inlet that turned assateague into an island the storm damaged or destroyed several hotels in the region{1] power telephone and telegraph outages occurred from cape charles through delaware{5] in baltimore 762xc2xa0in (194xc2xa0mm) of precipitation fell in 24xc2xa0hours setting a record and causing flooding{13] the storm surge wrecked a steamboat pier and promenade at chesapeake beach and damaged or destroyed 70xc2xa0houses in neighboring north beach in cheverly flooding caused nine cars of a train to derail{6] killing four people{15] statewide the storm caused about 7xc2xa0million in crop damage mostly to tobacco tomato and corn the high tides caused 3xc2xa0million in damage to the fishing industry having damaged or destroyed many boats and docks there was about 90000 worth of damage to the united states naval academy in annapolis{5] after docks were damaged{6] throughout the state the hurricane caused about 10xc2xa0million in property damage with another 11xc2xa0million to federal properties about 960000 in transportation damage and 364000 in utility damage{13]1933 hurricane rainfall across the northeastin neighboring delaware road damage was about 150000{5] after three bridges were wrecked along dupont highway{15] rainfall in the state reached 1324xc2xa0in (336xc2xa0mm) in bridgeville in washington dc the storm dropped 639xc2xa0in (162xc2xa0mm) of rainfall at the time the highest on record for a single day total{6] high winds knocked down trees and destroyed the roofs of several houses along the anacostia river flooding surpassed a seawall and traffic was disrupted when the benning bridge was flooded with 2xc2xa0ft (061xc2xa0m) of water the washington-hoover airport was also flooded{1] damage in the nation's capital was the worst since a tropical storm in 1896{9] the highest rainfall associated with the hurricane was 1328xc2xa0in (337xc2xa0mm) near york pennsylvania{16] on augustxc2xa024 the minimum pressure in philadelphia dropped to 996xc2xa0mbar (2940xc2xa0inhg) which was the lowest on record in the month of august at the time wind gusts in the city reached 42xc2xa0mph (68xc2xa0kmh) in the surrounding area winds and rainfall caused 1xc2xa0million in damage mostly to crops and houses and there were four deaths{13] rainfall caused the worst flooding in the lehigh valley since 1902 in york county floods destroyed 47xc2xa0bridges while in york proper about 3000xc2xa0people evacuated along the swollen codorus creek{6]hurricane-force winds potentially affected portions of delaware and southern new jersey in atlantic city new jersey winds reached 76xc2xa0mph (122xc2xa0kmh) at a height of 171xc2xa0ft (52xc2xa0m) which is 67xc2xa0mph (107xc2xa0kmh) at sea-level{4] at the time this was the highest wind report for the station in the month of august{13] rainfall in atlantic city totaled 812xc2xa0in (206xc2xa0mm) including 225xc2xa0in (57xc2xa0mm) that fell in an hour on augustxc2xa020{6] which was the monthly average two people drowned along the jersey shore due to high waves{17] and the storm capsized nine boats{18] the waves destroyed a 300xc2xa0ft (91xc2xa0m) long fishing pier in cape may{9] high winds damaged the boardwalk while streets were flooded in atlantic city and there was about 3xc2xa0million in damage{13] the storm spawned a tornado in wildwood at picatinny arsenal residents and members of the military helped prevent a dam from breaking{6] sustained winds of around 35xc2xa0mph (55xc2xa0kmh) were observed across northern new york{4] while the top of the empire state building reported a gust of 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh){15] heavy rainfall in the state increased water levels along streams causing one person to drown at mount tremper{13] after a dam broke 190xc2xa0people at godeffroy were stranded until they were rescued by a fire crew{19] a power outage during the storm caused the statue of liberty torch to extinguish for the first time since 1929{6] streets and basements of new york city were flooded after the heavy rainfall{18] the combination of flooding and fallen trees caused heavy traffic jams{15]the former hurricane passed near southern quebec as a tropical depression and later crossed southern nova scotia as an extratropical cyclone along lake ontario winds reached 51xc2xa0mph (81xc2xa0kmh) and in montreal winds reached 21xc2xa0mph (33xc2xa0kmh) after a dry summer the storm's accompanying rainfall was beneficial reaching 44xc2xa0in (112xc2xa0mm) in fredericton new brunswick and 2xc2xa0in (50xc2xa0mm) in halifax nova scotia the rains helped farmers in ontario and assisted firefighters in new brunswick and nova scotia in montreal 24xc2xa0in (60xc2xa0mm) of rainfall flooded a tunnel gusty winds knocked down power lines in portions of quebec nova scotia and nova scotia overall effects were minor limited to some utility damage and delays for shipping{20]see
