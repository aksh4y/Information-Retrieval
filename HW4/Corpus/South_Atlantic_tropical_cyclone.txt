b'south atlantic tropical cyclone - wikipedia south atlantic tropical cyclonefrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchtracks of significant south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones since 2004south atlantic tropical cyclones are unusual weather events that occur in the southern hemisphere strong wind shear which disrupts the formation of cyclones as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the south atlantic ocean make any strong tropical system extremely rare and catarina in 2004 was the only recorded south atlantic hurricane in history those storms have only developed during the months from november through to april in this basin since 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center has started to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in western side of this basin near brazil when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) the generally accepted minimum sustained wind velocity for a disturbance to be designated as a tropical storm in the north atlantic basin below is a list of notable south atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclonescontents1 theories concerning infrequency of

infrequency of occurrence{edit]until april 1991 it was thought that tropical cyclones did not develop within the south atlantic{1] very strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere is considered a deterrent{2] the intertropical convergence zone drops one to two degrees south of the equator{3] not far enough from the equator for the coriolis force to aid development water temperatures in the tropics of the southern atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north atlantic{4]during april 1991 these assertions were proven false when the united states national hurricane center reported that a tropical cyclone had developed over the eastern south atlantic{1]{5] in subsequent years a few systems were suspected to have the characteristics needed to be classified as a tropical cyclone including in march 1994 and january 2004{6]{7] during march 2004 an extratropical cyclone formally transitioned into a tropical cyclone and made landfall on brazil after becoming a category 2 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale while the system was threatening the brazilian state of santa catarina a newspaper used the headline "furacxc3xa3o catarina" which was originally presumed to mean "furacxc3xa3o (hurricane) threatening (santa) catarina (the state)"{1] after international presses started monitoring the system "hurricane catarina" has formally been adoptedat the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones (iwtc-vi) in 2006 it was questioned if any subtropical or tropical cyclones had developed within the south atlantic before catarina{7] it was noted that suspect systems had developed in january 1970 march 1994 january 2004 march 2004 may 2004 february 2006 and march 2006{7] it was also suggested that an effort should be made to locate any possible systems using satellite imagery and synoptic data; however it was noted that this effort may be hindered by the lack of any geostationary imagery over the basin before 1966{7] a study was subsequently performed and published during 2012 which concluded that there had been 63 subtropical cyclones in the southern atlantic between 1957 and 2007{8] during january 2009 a subtropical storm developed in the basin and in march 2010 a tropical storm developed which was named anita by the brazilian public and private weather services{9]{10] in 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center started to assign names to tropical and subtropical cyclones that develop within its area of responsibility to the west of 20xc2xb0w when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph){11]known storms and impacts{edit]1991 angola tropical storm{edit]tropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationapril 10 1991xc2xa0xe2x80x93 april 14 1991peak intensity65xc2xa0kmh

warm waters and caused minor damages on saint helena while the circulation became better defined according to the united states national hurricane center the system was probably either a tropical depression or a tropical storm at its peak intensity on april 14 the system rapidly dissipated as it was absorbed into a large squall line{12]{13]hurricane catarina{edit]category

catarinahurricane catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone forming in the southern atlantic ocean in march 2004{14] just after becoming a hurricane it hit the southern coast of brazil in the state of santa catarina on the evening of march 28 with winds estimated near 155 kilometres per hour (96xc2xa0mph) making it a category 2-equivalent on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the cyclone killed 3 to 10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in brazilat the time the brazilians were taken completely by surprise and were initially skeptical that an actual tropical cyclone could have formed in the south atlantic eventually however they were convinced and adopted the previously-unofficial name "catarina" for the storm after santa catarina state this event is considered by some meteorologists to be a nearly once-in-a-lifetime occurrencetropical storm anita{edit]tropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationmarch 8 2010xc2xa0xe2x80x93 march 12 2010peak

subtropical cyclone off the coast of southern brazil the following day the united states naval research laboratory began monitoring the system as a system of interest under the designation of 90q the national hurricane center also began monitoring the system as low sl90 during the afternoon of march 9 the system had attained an intensity of 55xc2xa0kmh (35xc2xa0mph) and a barometric pressure of 1000xc2xa0hpa (mbar) it was declared a tropical storm on march 10 and became extratropical late on march 12{15] anita's accumulated cyclone energy was estimated at 20525 by the florida state university there was no damage associated to the storm except high sea in the coasts of rio grande do sul and santa catarina post mortem the cyclone was given the name "anita" by private and public weather centers in southern brazil{16]subtropical storm arani{edit]subtropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationmarch 14 2011xc2xa0xe2x80x93 march 16 2011peak intensity85xc2xa0kmh

monitoring an organizing area of convection near the southeast coast of brazil{17] later that day a low pressure area developed just east of vitxc3xb3ria espxc3xadrito santo{18] and by 1200xc2xa0utc the system organized into a subtropical depression located about 140xc2xa0km (90xc2xa0mi) east of campos dos goytacazes{19] guided by a trough and a weak ridge to its north the system moved slowly southeastward over an area of warm waters{20]{21] intensifying into subtropical cyclone arani on march 15{22] as named by the brazilian navy hydrographic center{23] the storm was classified as subtropical as the convection was east of the center on march 16 arani began experiencing 25 knots of wind shear because another frontal system bumped it from behind{24]before it developed into a subtropical cyclone arani produced torrential rains over portions of southeastern brazil resulting in flash flooding and landslides significant damage was reported in portions of espxc3xadrito santo though specifics are unknown{25] increased swells along the coast prompted ocean travel warnings{26]subtropical storm bapo{edit]subtropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationfebruary 5

(170xc2xa0km) to the southeast of sxc3xa3o paulo brazil{27] over the next day low-level baroclincity decreased around the system as it moved south-eastwards away from the brazilian coast and intensified further{28] the system was named bapo by the brazilian navy hydrography center during february 6 after it had intensified into a subtropical storm{29]{30] over the next couple of days the system continued to move south-eastwards before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone during february 8{31]subtropical storm cari{edit]subtropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationmarch 10

warnings of subtropical depression 3 during early afternoon{32] while cptec already assigned the name cari for the storm{33] at 0000 utc on march 11 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy upgraded cari to a subtropical storm also assigning a name to it{34] on march 12 the brazilian hydrographic center downgraded cari to a subtropical depression{35] while the cptec stated that the storm became a "hybrid cyclone"{36] during early afternoon of march 13 the brazilian navy declared that cari became a remnant low{37]cari brought heavy rainfall flooding and landslides to eastern cities of santa catarina and rio grande do sul states{38] rain totals from 100xc2xa0mm to 180xc2xa0mm were observed associated with the storms and wind topped 75xc2xa0kmh (45xc2xa0mph) in cabo de santa marta{38] a navy buoy registered a 20-ft wave off the coast of santa catarina{38]subtropical storm deni{edit]subtropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationnovember 15 2016xc2xa0xe2x80x93 november 16

extratropical cyclone entered the ocean from santa catarina early on december 4 2016{42] later it intensified quickly and then transitioned into a subtropical storm shortly before 22:00 brst (00:00 utc on december 5) with the name exc3xa7axc3xad assigned by the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy{43] exc3xa7axc3xad started to decay on december 5 and weakened into a subtropical depression at around 00:00 utc on december 6{44]other systems{edit]pre-2004{edit]modis visible satellite imagery a possible january 2004 tropical cycloneaccording to a presentation at the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones (iwtc-vi) satellite imagery from january 1970 showed that a system with an eyewall had developed behind a cold front and that the system needed further analysis to determine if it was tropical or subtropical{7] on march 27 1974 a weak area of low pressure that had originated over the amazon river started to intensify further{45] over the next 48 hours the system quickly developed further and was classified as subtropical as it developed a banding structure and deep convection near its warm core{45] on march 29 a north-westerly flow encroached on the systems environment which caused the system to rapidly move towards 40s and the cold waters that were present to the south of 40xc2xb0s{45] in march 1994 a system that was thought to be weaker than catarina was spawned but was located over cool and open waters{46]2004xe2x80x932009{edit]during 2004 the large-scale conditions over the south atlantic were more conducive than usual for subtropical or tropical systems with 4 systems noted{7] the first possible tropical cyclone developed within a trough of low pressure to the southeast of salvador brazil on january 18{6]{7] the system subsequently displayed a small central dense overcast and was suspected to be at the peak of its development as either a tropical depression or a tropical storm during the next day{6] the system was subsequently affected by some strong shear before it moved inland and weakened along the coast of brazil before it was last noted during january 21{6] within brazil the system caused heavy rain and flooding with a state of emergency declared in aracaju after the river overflowed and burst its banks which flooded homes destroyed crops and caused parts of the highway to collapse{6] however it was noted that not all of the heavy rain and impacts were attributable to the system as a large monsoon low covered much of brazil at the time{6] the second system was a possible hybrid cyclone that developed near south-eastern brazil between march 15xe2x80x9316{7] hurricane catarina was the third system while the fourth system had a well-defined eye like structure and formed off the coast of brazil during on march 15 2004{7]modis visible satellite image of a possible february 2006 tropical stormon february 22 2006 a baroclinic cyclone intensified quickly and was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) after radar data showed that the system had developed an eye and banding{7] however there were questions about how tropical the system was as it did not separate from the westerlies or the baroclinic zone it was in{7]{47] between march 11xe2x80x9317 2006 a system with a warm core developed and moved southwards along the south atlantic zone{7]two subtropical cyclones affected both uruguay and rio grande do sul state in brazil on january 28 2009 a cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level warm-core low formed a system and moved eastward into the south atlantic{48] the storm produced rainfall in 24 hours of 300xc2xa0mm or more in some locations of rocha (uruguay) and southern rio grande do sul the weather station owned by metsul weather center in morro redondo southern brazil recorded 2782xc2xa0mm in a 24-hour period fourteen deaths and thousands of evacuees are attributed to the storm with an emergency declared in four cities{9] it lasted until february 1 when the cyclone became extratropical{49]2010xe2x80x932016{edit]subtropical storm in november 2010on november 16 2010 a cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level warm-core low formed a system state in brazil and moved southeastward into the south atlantic where it slightly deepened{50] the system brought locally heavy rains in southern brazil and northeast of uruguay that exceeded 200 millimeters in a few hours in some locations of southern rio grande do sul northwest of pelotas{51] damages and flooding were observed in cerrito sxc3xa3o lourenxc3xa7o do sul and pedro osxc3xb3rio{51] baxc3xb1ado de pajas departament of cerro largo in uruguay recorded 240xc2xa0mm of rain{51] the subtropical cyclone then became a weak trough on november 19 according to the cptec{52]between december 23 2013 and january 24 2015 the center for weather forecast and climatic studies (cptec) and navy hydrography center monitored four subtropical depressions to the south of rio de janeiro the first one lasted until christmas day 2013{53]{54]{55]{56] two subtropical depressions formed in 2014: one in late-february 2014 and the other in late-march 2014{57]{58]{59] a fourth one formed in late january 2015{60]{61]on january 5 2016 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy issued warnings on a subtropical depression that formed east of vitxc3xb3ria espxc3xadrito santo{62] on the next day the system strengthened into a tropical depression and other agencies considered it as an invest designating it as 90q;{63]{64] however on january 7 the tropical depression dissipated{63]{65]storm names{edit]the following names are published by the brazilian navy hydrographic center and used for named storms that form in the area west of 20xc2xbaw and south of equator in the south atlantic ocean since 2011 arani is confirmed to be used again in the future after its next nine names are all used but it is unclear if those names will be
