waalswaterstonbook:thermodynamicsvteenthalpy xcbx88xc9x9bnxcexb8xc9x99lpixc2xa0(xc2xa0listen) is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system it is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume{1]more technically it includes the internal energy which is the energy required to create a system and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure{2]enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy pressure and volume it is an extensive quantity the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the international system of units (si) is the joule but other historical conventional units are still in use such as the british thermal unit and the calorieenthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion workthe total enthalpy h of a system cannot be measured directly the same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy xcex94h the xcex94h is a positive change in endothermic reactions and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processesfor processes under constant pressure xcex94h is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings{3] this means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed (or released) by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume standard state: most commonly 1 bar pressure standard state does not strictly speaking specify a temperature (see standard state) but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25xc2xa0xc2xb0centhalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure unlike entropy and gibbs energy real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and

the ancient greek verb enthalpein (xe1xbcx90xcexbdxcexb8xcexacxcexbbxcfx80xcexb5xcexb9xcexbd) which means "to warm in"{4] it combines the classical greek prefix xe1xbcx90xcexbd- en- meaning "to put into" and the verb xcexb8xcexacxcexbbxcfx80xcexb5xcexb9xcexbd thalpein meaning "to heat" the word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to benoxc3xaet paul xc3x89mile clapeyron and rudolf clausius through the 1850 publication of their clausiusxe2x80x93clapeyron relation this misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of the mollier steam tables and diagrams however neither the concept the word nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after clapeyron's deaththe earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875{5] when josiah willard gibbs introduced "a heat function for constant pressure" however gibbs did not use the word "enthalpy" in his writings{note 1]the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j p dalton according to that publication heike kamerlingh onnes actually coined the word{6]over the years scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy in 1922 alfred w porter proposed the symbol "h" as a standard{7] thus finalizing the terminology still in use todayin the past enthalpy was sometimes called heat content{8]{7]{9] the fact that the change in enthalpy xcex94h equals the heat absorbed in processes at constant pressure is the reason for this name{10] however this equality is not true in general (when the pressure varies) so that the term heat content is considered misleading{11] and is now deprecatedformal definition{edit]the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as{12]{13]h=u+pv{displaystyle h=u+pv}whereh is the enthalpy of the systemu is the internal energy of the systemp is the pressure of the systemv is the volume of the systementhalpy is an extensive property this means that for homogeneous systems the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system it is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy hxc2xa0=xc2xa0hm where m is the mass of the system or the molar enthalpy hmxc2xa0=xc2xa0hn where n is the number of moles (h and hm are intensive properties) for inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:h=xe2x88x91khk{displaystyle h=sum _{k}h_{k}}where the label k refers to the various subsystems in case of continuously varying p t or composition the summation becomes an integral:h=xe2x88xabxcfx81hdv{displaystyle h=int rho hdv}where xcfx81 is the densitythe enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function h(sp) of the entropy s and the pressure p and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows we start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:du=xcexb4qxe2x88x92xcexb4w{displaystyle du=delta q-delta w}here xcexb4q is a small amount of heat added to the system and xcexb4w a small amount of work performed by the system in a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place so the second law of thermodynamics gives xcexb4q = txe2x80x89ds with t the absolute temperature of the system furthermore if only pv work is done xcexb4w = pxe2x80x89dv as a resultdu=tdsxe2x88x92pdv{displaystyle du=tds-pdv}adding d(pv) to both sides of this expression givesdu+d(pv)=tdsxe2x88x92pdv+d(pv){displaystyle du+d(pv)=tds-pdv+d(pv)}ord(u+pv)=tds+vdp{displaystyle d(u+pv)=tds+vdp}sodh(sp)=tds+vdp{displaystyle dh(sp)=tds+vdp}other expressions{edit]the above expression of dh in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers however there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:{12]:88{14]dh=cpdt+v(1xe2x88x92xcexb1t)dp{displaystyle dh=c_{p}dt+v(1-alpha t)dp}here cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and xcexb1 is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:xcexb1=1v(xe2x88x82vxe2x88x82t)p{displaystyle alpha ={frac {1}{v}}left({frac {partial v}{partial t}}right)_{p}}with this expression one can in principle determine the enthalpy if cp and v are known as functions of p and tnote that for an ideal gas xcexb1txc2xa0=xc2xa01{note 2] so thatdh=cpdt{displaystyle dh=c_{p}dt}in a more general form the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types the differential statement for dh then becomesdh=tds+vdp+xe2x88x91ixcexbcidni{displaystyle dh=tds+vdp+sum _{i}mu _{i}dn_{i}}where xcexbci is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle and ni is the number of such particles the last term can also be written as xcexbcixe2x80x89dni (with dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and in this case xcexbci the molar chemical potential) or as xcexbcixe2x80x89dmi (with dmi the mass of component i added to the system and in this case xcexbci the specific chemical potential)physical interpretation{edit]the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system and the pv term as the energy that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant when a system for example n moles of a gas of volume v at pressure p and temperature t is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv where pv is the work done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressurein basic physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used{15]{16] in basic chemistry experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled so that xcex94h is the expression chosen for the heat of reactionfor a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:{17]dh=xcexb4qxe2x88x92xcexb4w{displaystyle dh=delta q-delta w}where the work w done by the engine is:w=xe2x88x92xe2x88xaevdp{displaystyle w=-oint vdp}relationship to heat{edit]in order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply we return to the first law for closed systems: du = xcexb4q xe2x88x92 xcexb4w we apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface in this case the work term can be split into two contributions the so-called pv work given by pxe2x80x89dv (where here p is the pressure at the surface dv is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work xcexb4wxe2x80xb2 such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction so we write xcexb4w = pxe2x80x89dv + xcexb4wxe2x80xb2 in this case the first law reads:du=xcexb4qxe2x88x92pdvxe2x88x92xcexb4wxe2x80xb2{displaystyle du=delta q-pdv-delta w'}ordh=xcexb4q+vdpxe2x88x92xcexb4wxe2x80xb2{displaystyle dh=delta q+vdp-delta w'}from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat:dh=xcexb4q{displaystyle dh=delta q}provided that the system is under constant pressure (dpxc2xa0=xc2xa00) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (xcexb4w'xc2xa0=xc2xa00){18]applications{edit]in thermodynamics one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required pv differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic systemenergy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system assuming that the pressure p remains constant; this is the pv term the supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy u which includes activation energies ionization energies mixing energies vaporization energies chemical bond energies and so forth together these constitute the change in the enthalpy uxc2xa0+xc2xa0pv for systems at constant pressure with no external work done other than the pv work the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the systemfor a simple system with a constant number of particles the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant{19]heat of reaction{edit]main article: standard enthalpy of reactionthe total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly the enthalpy change of a system is measured instead enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:xcex94h=hfxe2x88x92hi{displaystyle delta h=h_{mathrm {f} }-h_{mathrm {i} }}wherexcex94h is the "enthalpy change"hf is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the products)hi is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the reactants)for an exothermic reaction at constant pressure the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings in a similar manner for an endothermic reaction the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings a relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of xcex94h if xcex94h is positive the reaction is endothermic that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants on the other hand if xcex94h is negative the reaction is exothermic that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat{20]specific enthalpy{edit]the specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h = hm where m is the mass of the system the si unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram it can be expressed in other specific quantities by h = u + pv where u is the specific internal energy p is the pressure and v is specific volume which is equal to 1xcfx81 where xcfx81 is the densityenthalpy changes{edit]an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed ie the enthalpy of the products and the initial enthalpy of the system ie the reactants these processes are reversible{why?] and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward changea common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation which has been determined for a large number of substances enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works such as the crc handbook of chemistry and physics the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamicswhen used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of 'process' since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters or standard conditions including:a temperature of 25xc2xa0xc2xb0c or 298xc2xa0ka pressure of one atmosphere (1xc2xa0atm or 101325xc2xa0kpa)a concentration of 10xc2xa0m when the element or compound is present in solutionelements or compounds in their normal physical states ie standard statefor such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term standard eg standard enthalpy of formationchemical properties:enthalpy of reaction

change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substancesopen systems{edit]in thermodynamic open systems matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:du=xcexb4q+duinxe2x88x92duoutxe2x88x92xcexb4w{displaystyle du=delta q+du_{ext{in}}-du_{ext{out}}-delta w}where uin is the average internal energy entering the system and uout is the average internal energy leaving the systemduring steady continuous operation an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy addedthe region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume and it may or may not correspond to physical walls if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid there are then two types of work performed: flow work described above which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called pv work) and shaft work which may be performed on some mechanical devicethese two types of work are expressed in the equationxcexb4w=d(poutvout)xe2x88x92d(pinvin)+xcexb4wshaft{displaystyle delta w=d(p_{ext{out}}v_{ext{out}})-d(p_{ext{in}}v_{ext{in}})+delta w_{ext{shaft}}}substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:ducv=xcexb4q+duin+d(pinvin)xe2x88x92duoutxe2x88x92d(poutvout)xe2x88x92xcexb4wshaft{displaystyle du_{ext{cv}}=delta q+du_{ext{in}}+d(p_{ext{in}}v_{ext{in}})-du_{ext{out}}-d(p_{ext{out}}v_{ext{out}})-delta w_{ext{shaft}}}the definition of enthalpy h permits us to use this thermodynamic potential to account for both internal energy and pv work in fluids for open systems:ducv=xcexb4q+dhinxe2x88x92dhoutxe2x88x92xcexb4wshaft{displaystyle du_{ext{cv}}=delta q+dh_{ext{in}}-dh_{ext{out}}-delta w_{ext{shaft}}}if we allow also the system boundary to move (eg due to moving pistons) we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems{21] in terms of time derivatives it reads:dudt=xe2x88x91kqxcbx99k+xe2x88x91khxcbx99kxe2x88x92xe2x88x91kpkdvkdtxe2x88x92p{displaystyle {frac {du}{dt}}=sum _{k}{dot {q}}_{k}+sum _{k}{dot {h}}_{k}-sum _{k}p_{k}{frac {dv_{k}}{dt}}-p}with sums over the various places k where heat is supplied matter flows into the system and boundaries are moving the xe1xb8xa2k terms represent enthalpy flows which can be written ashxcbx99k=hkmxcbx99k=hmnxcbx99k{displaystyle {dot {h}}_{k}=h_{k}{dot {m}}_{k}=h_{m}{dot {n}}_{k}}with xe1xb9x81k the mass flow and xe1xb9x85k the molar flow at position k respectively the term dvkdt represents the rate of change of the system volume at position k that results in pv power done by the system the parameter p represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power but it can also be eg electric power produced by an electrical power plantnote that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet{clarification needed] otherwise it has to be included in the enthalpy balance during steady-state operation of a device (see turbine pump and engine) the average dudt may be set equal to zero this yields a useful expression for the average power generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:p=xe2x88x91kxe2x9fxa8qxcbx99kxe2x9fxa9+xe2x88x91kxe2x9fxa8hxcbx99kxe2x9fxa9xe2x88x92xe2x88x91kxe2x9fxa8pkdvkdtxe2x9fxa9{displaystyle p=sum _{k}leftlangle {dot {q}}_{k}rightrangle +sum

throttling in the steady state fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2 the mass flow is xe1xb9x81one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process also known as joule-thomson expansion it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve porous plug or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure this process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiersfor a steady state flow regime the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant hence0=mxcbx99h1xe2x88x92mxcbx99h2{displaystyle 0={dot {m}}h_{1}-{dot {m}}h_{2}}since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:h1=h2{displaystyle h_{1}=h_{2}}that is the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling the consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the txe2x80x93s diagram above point c is at 200xc2xa0bar and room temperature (300xc2xa0k) a joulexe2x80x93thomson expansion from 200xc2xa0bar to 1xc2xa0bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425xc2xa0kjkg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450xc2xa0kjkg isenthalps and ends in point d which is at a temperature of about 270xc2xa0k hence the expansion from 200xc2xa0bar to 1xc2xa0bar cools nitrogen from 300xc2xa0k to 270xc2xa0k in the valve there is a lot of friction and a lot of entropy is produced but still the final temperature is below the starting value!point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h = 100 kjkg it corresponds roughly with p = 13 bar and t = 108 k throttling from this point to a pressure of 1xc2xa0bar ends in the two-phase region (point f) this means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in f (hf) is equal to the enthalpy in g (hg) multiplied by the liquid fraction in f (xf) plus the enthalpy in h (hh) multiplied by the gas fraction in f (1 xe2x88x92 xf) sohf=xfhg+(1xe2x88x92xf)hh{displaystyle h_{mathbf {f} }=x_{mathbf {f} }h_{mathbf {g} }+(1-x_{mathbf
