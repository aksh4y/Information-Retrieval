energy consumption (2015 data){1]total primary consumption in the world by fuel (2015)world energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphereinstitutions such as the international energy agency (iea) the us energy information administration (eia) and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutionsclosely related to energy consumption is the concept of total primary energy supply (tpes) which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes since changes of energy storage over the year are minor tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption however tpes ignores conversion efficiency overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (eg coal gas and nuclear) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (eg photovoltaic or hydroelectricity) the iea estimates that in 2013 total primary energy supply (tpes) was 1575 xc3x97 1017 wh (= 1575 pwh 567 xc3x97 1020 joules or 13541 mtoe){2] from 2000xe2x80x932012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period the demand for nuclear energy decreased in part due to nuclear disasters (eg three mile island 1979 chernobyl 1986 and fukushima 2011){1]{3]in 2011 expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of

(tpes) or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanityin 2014 world primary energy supply amounted to 155481xc2xa0terawatt-hour (twh) or 13541xc2xa0mtoe while the world final energy consumption was 109613xc2xa0twh or about 295 less than the total supply{9] world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel this non-energy use amounted to 9404 twh (809 mtoe) in 2012{11]by the end of 2014 the total installed global power generating capacity is nearly 6142 tw (million mw) which does not include the dg sets not connected to local electricity grids{12] in 2014 world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 408 natural gas 216 nuclear 106 hydro 164 'others' (solar wind geothermal biomass etc) 63 and oil 43 coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity the world's electricity consumption was 18608xc2xa0twh{citation needed] in 2012 this figure is about 18 smaller than

and 40 was consumed in the asia pacific region{1]recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national energy action plans such as the eu 2009 renewable energy directive to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas{3]{14] one such initiative was the united nations development programme's world energy assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources{3] from 2000xe2x80x932012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history with a consumption increase of 1765 million tonnes of oil during this period oil coal and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy the following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period{1]trends{edit]world primary energy consumption in quadrillion btu{15]energy intensity of different economies: the graph shows the ratio between energy usage and gdp for selected countries gdp is based on 2004 purchasing power parity and 2000 dollars adjusted for inflation{16]gdp and energy consumption in japan 1958xe2x80x932000: the data shows the correlation between gdp and energy use; however it also shows that this link can be broken after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while japan's gdp continued to grow after 1985 under the influence of the then much cheaper oil energy use resumed its historical relation to gdp{17]the energy consumption growth in the g20 slowed down to 2 in 2011 after the strong increase of 2010 the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption{18]according to iea data from 1990 to 2008 the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27 regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the middle east increased by 170 china by 146 india by 91 africa by 70 latin america by 66 the usa by 20 the eu-27 block by 7 and world overall grew by 39in 2008 total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132000 terawatt-hours (twh) or 474 exajoules (ej){19] in 2012 primary energy demand increased to 158000 twh (567xc2xa0ej){20]energy consumption in the g20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009 in 2009 world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 11 or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 06 in 2009{21]this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia (+4) conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 47 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the cis consumptions shrank by 45 5 and 85 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the world's largest energy consumer (18 of the total) since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 (up from 4 in 2008) oil remained the largest energy source (33) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009 it accounted for 27 of the totalmost energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials in 2008 the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50 (19523941xc2xa0mt) gas 25 (8003149xc2xa0bcm) and hard coal 14 (7935845xc2xa0mt){22]most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable; for example via solar pvthermal wind hydro- or wave power the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter (see solar constant) though it fluctuates by about 69 during the year due to the earth's varying distance from the sun this value after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the earth is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet; about half 89000xc2xa0tw reaches the earth's surface{23]the estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 04xc2xa0 yottajoule (yj) or 4 xc3x97 1023 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 25xc2xa0yj fossil fuels range from 06 to 3xc2xa0yj if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 55xc2xa0yj per year though not all of this is available for human consumption the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of 48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks"{24]according to iea (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2xc2xa0xc2xb0c is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes if action is not taken before 2017 co2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017 fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix supported by 523 billion subsidies in 2011 up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than

problem efforts to resolve this include the kyoto protocol which is a un agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts which a number of nations have signed limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius thought to be a risk by the sei is now doubtfulto limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050 if the population is 10 billion in 2050{28] across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year in 2011 the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem hypothetically according to robert engelman (worldwatch institute) in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009){29]greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (sox) nitrous oxides (nox) and particulate matter (pm) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution{30] biomass combustion is a major contributor{30]{31]{32] in addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion most biomass has high co2 emissions{33]by

photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air from 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 13 of global energy{77]geothermal{edit]main articles: geothermal
