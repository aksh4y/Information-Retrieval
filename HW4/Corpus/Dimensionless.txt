template message)in dimensional analysis a dimensionless quantity is a quantity to which no physical dimension is applicable it is also known as a bare number or a quantity of dimension one{1] and the corresponding unit of measurement in the si is one (or 1) unit{2]{3] and it is not explicitly shown dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields such as mathematics physics engineering and economics by contrast examples of quantities with dimensions are length time and speed which are measured in dimensional units such as metre second and metre per secondcontents1 history2 pure numbers3

fields7 see also8 referenceshistory{edit]see also: dimensional analysis xc2xa7xc2xa0historyquantities having dimension 1 habitually called dimensionless quantities regularly occur in sciences and are formally treated within the field of dimensional analysis in the nineteenth century french mathematician joseph fourier and scottish physicist james clerk maxwell led significant developments in the modern concepts of dimension and unit later work by british physicists osborne reynolds and lord rayleigh contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics building on rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis edgar buckingham proved the xcfx80 theorem (independent of french mathematician joseph bertrand's previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities numerous other dimensionless numbers mostly ratios were coined in the early 1900s particularly in the areas of fluid mechanics and heat transfer measuring ratios in the (derived) unit db (decibel) finds widespread use nowadays in the early 2000s the international committee for weights and measures discussed naming the unit of 1 as the 'uno' but the idea of just introducing a new si-name for 1 was dropped{4]{5]{6]pure numbers{edit]all pure numbers are dimensionless quantities for example 1 i xcfx80 e and xcfx86{7] units of number such as the dozen gross googol and avogadro's number may also be considered dimensionlessratios proportions and angles{edit]dimensionless quantities are often obtained as ratios of quantities that are not dimensionless but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation{8] examples include calculating slopes or unit conversion factors a more complex example of such a ratio is engineering strain a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length since both quantities have the dimension length their ratio is dimensionless another set of examples is mass fractions or mole fractions often written using parts-per notation such as ppm (=xc2xa010xe2x88x926) ppb (=xc2xa010xe2x88x929) and ppt (=xc2xa010xe2x88x9212) or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units (kgkg or molmol) for example alcohol by volume which characterizes the concentration of ethanol in an alcoholic beverage could be written as ml  100 mlother common proportions are percentages xc2xa0(=xc2xa0001) xc2xa0xe2x80xb0xc2xa0(=xc2xa00001) and angle units such as radians degrees and grads in statistics the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to measure the dispersion in the databuckingham xcfx80 theorem{edit]the buckingham xcfx80 theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system a statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e g pressure and volume are linked by boyle's law xe2x80x93 they are inversely proportional) if the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units then the equation would not be an identity and buckingham's theorem would not holdanother consequence of the theorem is that the functional dependence between a certain number (say n) of variables can be reduced by the number (say k) of independent dimensions occurring in those variables to give a set of p = n xe2x88x92 k independent dimensionless quantities for the purposes of the experimenter different systems that share the same description by dimensionless quantity are equivalentexample{edit]to demonstrate the application of the xcfx80 theorem consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape the power p in dimensions {m xc2xb7 l2t3] is a function of the density xcfx81 {ml3] and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred xcexbc {m(l xc2xb7 t)] as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter d {l] and the angular speed of the stirrer n {1t] therefore we have a total of n = 5 variables representing our example those n = 5 variables are built up from k = 3 fundamental dimensions the length: l (si units: m) time: t (s) and mass: m (kg)according to the xcfx80-theorem the n = 5 variables can be reduced by the k = 3 dimensions to form p = n xe2x88x92 k = 5 xe2x88x92 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers these quantities are re=xcfx81nd2xcexbc{displaystyle mathrm {re} ={frac {rho nd^{2}}{mu }}} commonly named the reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime and

dimensionless physical constantcertain fundamental physical constants such as the speed of light in a vacuum the universal gravitational constant planck's constant and boltzmann's constant can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for time length mass charge and temperature are chosen the resulting system of units is known as the natural units however not all physical constants can be normalized in this fashion for example the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined experimentally:{9]xcexb1 xe2x89x88 1137 the fine structure
