they brought the latin language with them from which all romance languages descend the language was spread by roman soldiers settlers and merchants who built roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous celtic or celtiberian civilizations established long before the roman arrivalsbetween 409 ad and 711 ad as the roman empire collapsed in western europe the iberian peninsula was conquered by germanic peoples of the migration period the occupiers mainly suebi{10]{11] and visigoths who originally spoke germanic languages quickly adopted late roman culture and the vulgar latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations after the moorish invasion beginning in 711 arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions but most of the remaining christian population continued to speak a form of romance commonly known as mozarabic which lasted three centuries longer in spainportuguese evolved from the medieval language known today by linguists as galician-portuguese old portuguese or old galician of the northwestern medieval kingdom of galicia it is in latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written galician-portuguese words and phrases are first recorded this phase is known as proto-portuguese which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the county of portugal from the kingdom of lexc3xb3n by then reigning over galiciain the first part of the galician-portuguese period (from the 12th to the 14th century) the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms for some time it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in christian hispania much as occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in france portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139 under king afonso i of portugal in 1290 king denis of portugal created the first portuguese university in lisbon (the estudos gerais which later moved to coimbra) and decreed for portuguese then simply called the "common language" to be known as the portuguese language and used officiallyin the second period of old portuguese in the 15th and 16th centuries with the portuguese discoveries the language was taken to many regions of africa asia and the americas by the mid-16th century portuguese had become a lingua franca in asia and africa used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and europeans of all nationalitiesits spread was helped by mixed marriages between portuguese and local people and by its association with roman catholic missionary efforts which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called kristang in many parts of asia (from the word cristxc3xa3o "christian") the language continued to be popular in parts of asia until the 19th century some portuguese-speaking christian communities in india sri lanka malaysia and indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from portugalthe end of the old portuguese period was marked by the publication of the cancioneiro geral by garcia de resende in 1516 the early times of modern portuguese which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from classical latin and classical greek because of the renaissance which greatly enriched the lexicon most literate portuguese speakers were also literate in latin; and thus they easily adopted latin words into their writingxe2x80x94and eventually speechxe2x80x94in portuguese{citation needed]spanish author miguel de cervantes once called portuguese "the sweet and gracious language" while the brazilian poet olavo bilac described it as a xc3xbaltima flor do lxc3xa1cio inculta e bela ("the last flower of latium rustic and beautiful") portuguese is also termed "the language of camxc3xb5es" after luxc3xads vaz de camxc3xb5es one of the greatest literary figures in the portuguese language and author of the portuguese epic poem os lusxc3xadadas{12]{13]{14]in march 2006 the museum of the portuguese language an interactive museum about

lusophone diaspora estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 45 million portuguese 3 million brazilians and half a million cape verdeans among others) although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of lusophone territory or are children of immigrants and may have only a basic command of the language it is also important to note that a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the portuguese-speaking countries and territories such as the high number of brazilian and palop emigrant citizens in portugal or the high number of portuguese emigrant citizens in the palop and brazilthe portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily who have direct or indirect legal juridical and social contact with it varying from the only language used in any contact to only education contact with local

according to the newspaper the portugal news publishing data given from unesco the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern africa and south america{54] portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents and as a second language by millions worldwidesince 1991 when brazil signed into the economic community of mercosul with other south american nations namely argentina uruguay and paraguay portuguese is either mandatory or taught in the schools of those south american countriesalthough early in the 21st century after macau was ceded to china and brazilian immigration to japan slowed down the use of portuguese was in decline in asia it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful portuguese-speaking countries (brazil angola mozambique etc) in the world{55]dialects{edit]main articles: portuguese dialects and portuguese in the americasethnically diverse east timor has portuguese as one of its official languagesvocxc3xaa is used for educated formal and colloquial respectful speech in most portuguese-speaking regions in the brazilian state of rio grande do sul vocxc3xaa is virtually absent from the spoken language in portugal it may be considered disrespectful to treat a stranger as vocxc3xaa so the pronoun is either replaced by the name of the person (or a title) or it is omitted since the verbal conjugation allows the distinction between formal and informal treatment riograndense (or gaxc3xbacho) portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation informal speech employs tu followed by third person verbs formal language retains the traditional second personconjugation of tu has three different forms in brazil (verb "to see": tu viste? in the traditional second person tu viu? in the third person and tu visse? in the innovative second person) the conjugation used in the brazilian states of parxc3xa1 santa catarina and maranhxc3xa3o being generally traditional second person the kind that is used in other portuguese-speaking countries and learned in brazilian schoolsthe predominance of southeastern-based media products has established vocxc3xaa as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications however in the city of rio de janeiro the country's main cultural centre the usage of tu has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century (see{56] a linguistic research on the topic in portuguese) being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other brazilian dialects{57]{58]the status of second person pronouns in brazil red indicates near exclusive use of vocxc3xaa mauve indicates decidedly predominant use of tu but with near exclusive third person (vocxc3xaa-like) verbal conjugation brown indicates 50-50 tuvocxc3xaa variation being tu nearly always accompanied by third person (vocxc3xaa-like) verbal conjugation light blue indicates decidedly predominant to near exclusive use of tu with reasonable frequency of second person (tu-like) verbal conjugation yellow indicates balanced vocxc3xaatu distribution being tu exclusively accompanied by third person (vocxc3xaa-like) verbal conjugation green indicates balanced vocxc3xaatu distribution tu being predominantly accompanied by third person (vocxc3xaa-like) verbal conjugationmodern standard european portuguese (portuguxc3xaas padrxc3xa3o or portuguxc3xaas continental) is based on the portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of coimbra and lisbon in central portugal standard european portuguese is also the preferred standard by the portuguese-speaking african countries as such and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world portuguese has only two dialects used for learning: the european and the brazilian some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of brazil are exclusive to south america and cannot be found in europe however the santomean portuguese in africa may be confused with a brazilian dialect by its phonology and prosodyaudio samples of some dialects and accents of portuguese are available below{59] there are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible ipa transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciationbrazil{edit]caipira xe2x80x94 spoken in the states of sxc3xa3o paulo (most markedly on the countryside and rural areas); southern minas gerais northern paranxc3xa1 and southeastern mato grosso do sul depending on the vision of what constitutes caipira trixc3xa2ngulo mineiro border areas of goixc3xa1s and the remaining parts of mato grosso do sul are included and the frontier of caipira in minas gerais is expanded further northerly though not reaching metropolitan belo horizonte it is often said that caipira appeared by decreolization of the lxc3xadngua brasxc3xadlica and the related lxc3xadngua geral paulista then spoken in almost all of what is now sxc3xa3o paulo a former lingua franca in most of the contemporary centro-sul of brazil before the 18th century brought by the bandeirantes interior pioneers of colonial brazil closely related to its northern counterpart nheengatu and that is why the dialect shows many general differences from other variants of the language{60] it has striking remarkable differences in comparison to other brazilian dialects in phonology prosody and grammar often stigmatized as being strongly associated with a substandard variant now mostly rural{61]{62]{63]{64]{65]cearense or costa norte xe2x80x94 is a dialect spoken more sharply in the states of cearxc3xa1 and piauxc3xad the variant of cearxc3xa1 includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in piauxc3xad though such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary (for example a debuccalization process stronger than that of portuguese a different system of the vowel harmony that spans brazil from fluminense and mineiro to amazofonia but is especially prevalent in nordestino a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of portugal and rio de janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of nordestino a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of nordestino among others as well as a great number of archaic portuguese words){66]{67]{68]{69]{70]{71]baiano xe2x80x94 found in bahia sergipe northern minas gerais and border regions with goixc3xa1s and tocantins similar to nordestino it has a very characteristic syllable-timed rhythm and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open-mid {xc9x9b] and {xc9x94]variants and sociolects of brazilian portuguese fluminense xe2x80x94 a broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of rio de janeiro espxc3xadrito santo and neighbouring eastern regions of minas gerais fluminense formed in these previously caipira-speaking areas due to the gradual influence of european migrants causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms{72] fluminense is sometimes referred to as carioca however carioca is a more specific term referring to the accent of the greater rio de janeiro area by speakers with a fluminense dialectgaxc3xbacho xe2x80x94 in rio grande do sul similar to sulista there are many distinct accents in rio grande do sul mainly due to the heavy influx of european immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state and to the proximity to spanish-speaking nations the gaxc3xbacho word in itself is a spanish loanword into portuguese of obscure indigenous amerindian originspercentage of worldwide portuguese speakers per countrymineiro xe2x80x94 minas gerais (not prevalent in the trixc3xa2ngulo mineiro) as the fluminense area its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where caipira was spoken but the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous brazilian region what attracted portuguese colonists commoners from other parts of brazil and their african slaves south-southwestern southeastern and northern areas of the state have fairly distinctive speech actually approximating to caipira fluminense (popularly called often pejoratively carioca do brejo "marsh carioca") and baiano respectively areas including and surrounding belo horizonte have a distinctive accent nordestino{73] xe2x80x94 more marked in the sertxc3xa3o (7) where in the 19th and 20th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the sertxc3xa3o (the dry land after agreste) of pernambuco and southern cearxc3xa1 it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other portuguese dialects than galician or rioplatense spanish and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities along the coasts it can be divided in two regional variants one that includes the northern maranhxc3xa3o and southern of piauxc3xad and other that goes from cearxc3xa1 to alagoasnortista or amazofoniaxc2xa0xe2x80x94 most of amazon basin states ie northern brazil before the 20th century most people from the nordestino area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here so it has some similarities with the portuguese dialect there spoken the speech in and around the cities of belxc3xa9m and manaus has a more european flavor in phonology prosody and grammarpaulistano xe2x80x94 variants spoken around greater sxc3xa3o paulo in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of sxc3xa3o paulo state as well perhaps "educated speech" from anywhere in the state of sxc3xa3o paulo (where it coexists with caipira) caipira is the hinterland sociolect of much of the central-southern half of brazil nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and

described as 'linguistic prejudice' often correlated with classism{74]{75]{76] is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of adoniran barbosa also the "paulistano" accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of sxc3xa3o paulo especially the italianssertanejo xe2x80x94 center-western states and also much of tocantins and rondxc3xb4nia it is

sxc3xa3o paulo state encompassing most of southern brazil the city of curitiba does have a fairly distinct accent as well and a relative majority of speakers around and in florianxc3xb3polis also speak this variant (many speak florianopolitano or manezinho da ilha instead related to the european portuguese dialects spoken in azores and madeira) speech of northern paranxc3xa1 is closer to that of inland sxc3xa3o pauloflorianopolitano xe2x80x94 variants heavily influenced by european portuguese spoken in florianxc3xb3polis city (due to a heavy immigration movement from portugal mainly its insular regions) and much of its metropolitan area grande florianxc3xb3polis said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble sulista dialects and those whose speech most resemble fluminense and european ones called often pejoratively manezinho da ilhacarioca xe2x80x94 not a dialect but sociolects of the fluminense variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to greater rio de janeiro it appeared after locals came in contact with the portuguese aristocracy amidst the portuguese royal family fled in the early 19th century there is actually a continuum between vernacular countryside accents and the carioca sociolect and the educated speech (in portuguese norma culta which most closely resembles other brazilian portuguese standards but with marked recent portuguese influences the nearest ones among the country's dialects along florianopolitano) so that not all people native to the state of rio de janeiro speak the said sociolect but most carioca speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality for example)brasiliense xe2x80x94 used in brasxc3xadlia and its

differing from amazofonia (in the opposite group of brazilian dialects in which it is placed along nordestino baiano mineiro and fluminense) it is the most recent dialect which appeared by the

which became diphthongs in most other romance languages; cf port cat sard pedraxc2xa0; fr pierre sp piedra it pietra ro piatrxc4x83 from lat petra ("stone"); or port fogo cat foc sard fogu; sp fuego it fuoco fr feu ro foc from lat focus ("fire") another characteristic of early portuguese was the loss of intervocalic l and n sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them: cf lat salire ("to jump") tenere ("to hold") catena ("chain") sp salir tener cadena port sair ter cadeia this characteristic happens today in celtic languages such as irish and scottish gaelic{80]when the elided consonant was n it often nasalized the preceding vowel: cf lat manum ("hand") ranam ("frog") bonum ("good") port mxc3xa3o rxc3xa3a bxc3xb5o (now mxc3xa3o rxc3xa3 bom) this process was the source of most of the language's distinctive nasal diphthongs in particular the latin endings -anem -anum and -onem became -xc3xa3o in most cases cf lat canis ("dog") germanus ("brother") ratio ("reason") with modern port cxc3xa3o irmxc3xa3o razxc3xa3o and their plurals -anes -anos -ones normally became -xc3xa3es -xc3xa3os -xc3xb5es cf cxc3xa3es irmxc3xa3os razxc3xb5es this nasalisation could be an ancient proto-celtic characteristic which also exists today in breton and gaelic{81]the portuguese language is also the only romance language that has preserved the clitic case mesoclisis: cf dar-te-ei (i'll give thee) amar-te-ei (i'll love you) contactxc3xa1-los-ei (i'll contact them) it was also the only western romance language to retain the latin synthetic pluperfect tense: eu estivera (i had been) eu vivera (i had lived) vxc3xb3s vivxc3xaareis (you had lived){82] romanian also has this tense but uses the -s- formvocabulary{edit]main article: portuguese vocabularythe national library of brazil in rio de janeiro the largest library in latin americabaroque library of the coimbra university portugalthe royal portuguese reading room in rio de janeiro brazila sign in the museum of macaumost of the lexicon of portuguese is derived directly or through other romance languages from latin nevertheless because of its original celtiberian heritage and later the participation of portugal in the age of discovery it has some gallaecian words and adopted loanwords from all over the worlda number of portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-roman inhabitants of portugal which included the gallaeci lusitanians celtici and cynetes most of these words derived from celtic and are very often shared with galician since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of galician-portuguese a few of these words existed in latin as loanwords from a celtic source often gaulish altogether these are over 1000 words some verbs and toponymic names of towns rivers utensils and plantsin the 5th century the iberian peninsula (the roman hispania) was conquered by the germanic suebi and visigoths as they adopted the roman civilization and language however these people contributed with some 500 germanic words to the lexicon many of these words are related to warfarexe2x80x94such as espora "spur" estaca "stake" and guerra "war" from gothic spaxc3xbara stakka and wirro respectively the germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by visigoth sovereigns and their descendants and it dwells on placenames such has ermesinde esposende and resende where sinde and sende are derived from the germanic "sinths" (military expedition) and in the case of resende the prefix re comes from germanic "reths" (council) other examples of portuguese names surnames and town names of germanic toponymic origin include henrique henriques vermoim mandim calquim baguim gemunde guetim sermonde and many more are quite common mainly in the old suebi and later visigothic dominated regions covering today's northern half of portugal and galiciabetween the 9th and early 13th centuries portuguese acquired nearly 800 words from arabic by influence of moorish iberia they are often recognizable by the initial arabic article a(l)- and include many common words such as aldeia "village" from xd8xa7xd9x84xd8xb6xd9x8axd8xb9xd8xa9 alxe1xb8x8dai`a (or from edictum rothari: aldii aldias){83] alface "lettuce" from xd8xa7xd9x84xd8xaexd8xb3 alkhass armazxc3xa9m "warehouse" from xd8xa7xd9x84xd9x85xd8xaexd8xb2xd9x86 almakhzan and azeite "olive oil" from xd8xa7xd9x84xd8xb2xd9x8axd8xaa azzaitstarting in the 15th century the portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from asian languages for instance catana "cutlass" from japanese katana and chxc3xa1 "tea" from chinese chxc3xa1from the 16th to the 19th centuries because of the role of portugal as intermediary in the atlantic slave trade and the establishment of large portuguese colonies in angola mozambique and brazil portuguese acquired several words of african and amerind origin especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories while those terms are mostly used in the former colonies many became current in european portuguese as well from kimbundu for example came kifumate > cafunxc3xa9 "head caress" (brazil) kusula > caxc3xa7ula "youngest child" (brazil) marimbondo "tropical wasp" (brazil) and kubungula > bungular "to dance like a wizard" (angola) from south america came batata "potato" from taino; ananxc3xa1s and abacaxi from tupixe2x80x93guarani nanxc3xa1 and tupi ibxc3xa1 cati respectively (two species of pineapple) and pipoca "popcorn" from tupi and tucano "toucan" from guarani tucanfinally it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other european languages especially french and english these are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords there are many examples such as: colchetecrochxc3xaa "bracket""crochet" paletxc3xb3 "jacket" batom "lipstick" and filxc3xa9filete "steak""slice" rua "street" respectively from french crochet paletot bxc3xa2ton filet rue; and bife "steak" futebol revxc3xb3lver stockestoque folclore from english beef football revolver stock folkloreexamples from other european languages: macarrxc3xa3o "pasta" piloto "pilot" carroxc3xa7a "carriage" and barraca "barrack" from italian maccherone pilota carrozza and baracca; melena "hair lock" fiambre "wet-cured ham" (in portugal in contrast with presunto "dry-cured ham" from latin prae-exsuctus "dehydrated") or "canned ham" (in brazil in contrast with non-canned wet-cured presunto cozido and dry-cured presunto cru) and castelhano "castilian" from spanish melena "mane" fiambre and castellanobefore the last four decades brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from japanese and other european languages (due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics) and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the portuguese while the degree of african tupian and other amerindian lexicon in brazilian portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local africanist and indianist academia (that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of brazilians in relation to the portuguese) so that its lexicon is almost identical (about 99) to that of european portuguese{84]{85]{86]many portuguese settlers to colonial brazil were from northern and insular portugal{87] apart from some historically important illegal immigrants from elsewhere in europe such as galicia france and the netherlands{88] it should be noted that brazil received more european immigrants in its colonial history than the united states between 1500 and 1760 700000 europeans (overwhelmingly portuguese) settled in brazil while 530000 europeans settled in the united states for the same given time{89]classification and related languages{edit]map showing the historical retreat and expansion of portuguese (galician-portuguese) within the context of its linguistic neighbours between the year 1000 and 2000map showing mostly contemporary west iberian and occitano-romance languages as well many of their mainland european dialects (take note that areas colored green gold or pinkpurple represent languages deemed endangered by unesco so this may be outdated in less than a few decades) it shows european portuguese galician eonavian mirandese and the fala as not only closely related but as dialect continuum though it excludes dialects spoken in insular portugal (azores and madeiraxe2x80x93canaries is not shown either)main articles: iberian romance languages galician-portuguese and comparison of spanish and portugueseportuguese belongs to the west iberian branch of the romance languages and it has special ties with the following members of this group:galician fala and portunhol do pampa (the way riverense and its sibling dialects are referred to in portuguese) its closest relativesmirandese leonese asturian extremaduran and cantabrian (astur-leonese languages) mirandese is the only recognised regional language spoken in portugal (beside portuguese the only official language in portugal)spanish and calxc3xa3o (the way calxc3xb3 language of the iberian romani is referred to in portuguese)portuguese and other romance languages (namely french and italian) are not mutually intelligible although they share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those romance languages and vice versa however portuguese and galician are mutually intelligible given that portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than spanish portuguese is only moderately intelligible to some spanish speakers despite the strong lexical and grammatical similarity (89) between the two{90]{91]{92]{93]portunhol a form of code-switching has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in south america said code-switching is not to be confused with the portunhol spoken on the borders of brazil with uruguay (dialeto do pampa) and paraguay (dialeto dos brasiguaios) and of portugal with spain (barranquenho) that are portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people which have been heavily influenced by spanish{94]portuguese and spanish are the only ibero-romance languages and perhaps the only romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language (known as 'portunhol') without a learned acquisition process but nevertheless facilitates communication there is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena (including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage){94]galician-portuguese in spain{edit]see also: reintegrationismthe closest relative of portuguese is galician which is spoken in the autonomous community (region) of galicia (northwestern spain) the two were at one time a single language known today as galician-portuguese but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of portugal from galicia there is however still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of galician referred to as galego-portuguxc3xaas baixo-limiao which is spoken in several galician villages between the municipalities of entrimo and lobios and the transborder region of the natural park of peneda-gerxc3xaasxurxc3xaas it is "considered a rarity a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from cantabria to mondego {]"{95] as reported by unesco due to the pressure of the spanish language on the standard official version of the galician language the galician language was on the verge of disappearing{95] according to the unesco philologist tapani salminen the proximity to portuguese protects galician{96] nevertheless the core vocabulary and grammar of galician are still noticeably closer to portuguese than to those of spanish in particular like portuguese it uses the future subjunctive the personal infinitive and the synthetic pluperfect mutual intelligibility (estimated at 90 by r a hall jr 1989){97] is excellent between galicians and northern portuguese many linguists consider galician to be a co-dialect of the portuguese languageanother member of the galician-portuguese group most commonly thought of as a galician dialect is spoken in the eonavian region in a western strip in asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of lexc3xb3n and zamora along the frontier with galicia between the eo and navia rivers (or more exactly eo and frexulfe rivers) it is called eonaviego or gallego-asturiano by its speakersthe fala language known by its speakers as xalimxc3xa9s maxc3xb1egu a fala de xxc3xa1lima and chapurrxc3xa1u and in portuguese as a fala de xxc3xa1lima a fala da estremadura o galego da estremadura valego ou galaico-estremenho is another descendant of galician-portuguese spoken by a small number of people in the spanish towns of valverde del fresno (valverdi du fresnu) eljas (as ellas) and san martxc3xadn de trevejo (sa martxc3xadn de trevellu) in the autonomous community of extremadura near the border with portugalthere are a number of other places in spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the galician-portuguese group such as la alamedilla cedillo (cedilho) herrera de alcxc3xa1ntara (ferreira d'alcxc3xa2ntara) and olivenza (olivenxc3xa7a) but in these municipalities what is spoken is actually portuguese not disputed as such in the mainstreamit should be noticed that the diversity of dialects of the portuguese language is known since the time of medieval portuguese-galician language when it coexisted with the lusitanian-mozarabic dialect spoken in the south of portugal the dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of fernxc3xa3o d'oliveira in the grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa (1536) where he remarks that the people of portuguese regions of beira alentejo estremadura and entre douro e minho all speak differently from each other also contador d'argote (1725) distinguishes three main varieties of dialects: the local dialects the dialects of time and of profession (work jargon) of local dialects he highlights five main dialects: the dialect of estremadura of entre-douro e minho of beira of algarve and of trxc3xa1s-os-montes he also makes reference to the overseas dialects the rustic dialects the poetic dialect and that of prose{98]in the kingdom of portugal ladinho (or lingoagem ladinha) was the name given to the pure portuguese language romance without any mixture of aravia or gerigonxc3xa7a judenga{99] while the term lxc3xadngua vulgar was used to name the language before d dinis decided to call it "portuguese language"{100] the erudite version used and known as galician-portuguese (the language of the portuguese court) and all other portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time in a historical perspective the portuguese language was never just one dialect just like today there is a standard portuguese (actually two) among the several dialects of portuguese in the past there was galician-portuguese as the "standard" coexisting with other dialectsinfluence on other languages{edit]see also: list of

the extensive contacts between portuguese travelers and settlers african and asian slaves and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of portuguese influence as each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations they evolved into fully fledged creole languages which remained in use in many parts of asia africa and south america until the 18th century some portuguese-based or portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today by over 3 million people worldwide especially people of partial portuguese ancestryphonology{edit]main article: portuguese phonologyportuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as french (especially that of quebec) the gallo-italic languages occitan catalan and franco-provenxc3xa7al unlike that of spanish which is similar to those of sardinian and the southern italian dialects some would describe the phonology of portuguese as a blend of spanish gallo-romance (eg french) and the languages of northern italy (especially genoese) but with a deeper celtic influence{105]there is a maximum of 9 oral vowels 2 semivowels and 21 consonants; though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes there are also five nasal vowels which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowelsvowels{edit]chart of monophthongs of the portuguese of lisbon with its xc9x90 xc9x90xccx83

w{109]the consonant hereafter denoted as xcax81 has a variety of realizations depending on dialect in europe it is typically a uvular trill {xcax80]; however a pronunciation as a voiced uvular fricative {xcax81] may be becoming dominant in urban areas there is also a realization as a voiceless uvular fricative {xcfx87] and the original pronunciation as an alveolar trill {r] also remains very common in various dialects{114] a common realization of the word-initial r in the lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative {xcax80xccx9d]{115] in brazil xcax81 can be velar uvular or glottal and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds;{116] it is usually pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative {x] a voiceless glottal fricative {h] or voiceless uvular fricative {xcfx87] see also guttural r in portugueses and z are normally lamino-alveolar as in english however a number of dialects in northern portugal pronounce s and z as apico-alveolar sibilants (sounding somewhat like

{xc9xa3] respectively except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels;{117]{118] a similar process occurs in spanishgrammar{edit]main article: portuguese grammara notable aspect of the grammar of portuguese is the verb morphologically more verbal inflections from classical latin have been preserved by portuguese than by any other major romance language the portuguese and spanish grammars are very close it also has some innovations not found in other romance languages (except galician and the fala):the present perfect has an iterative sense unique to the galician-portuguese language group it denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past and are expected to keep repeating in the future for instance the sentence tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to "i have been trying to talk to her" not "i have tried to talk to her" on the other hand the correct translation of the question "have you heard the latest news?" is not tem ouvido a xc3xbaltima notxc3xadcia? but ouviu a xc3xbaltima notxc3xadcia? since no repetition is implied{119]vernacular portuguese still uses the future subjunctive mood which developed from medieval west iberian romance and in present-day spanish and galician has almost entirely fallen into disuse the future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur english normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances:se eu for eleito presidente mudarei a leiif i should be elected president i will change the lawquando fores mais velho vais entenderwhen you grow older you will understandthe personal infinitive: infinitives can inflect according to their subject in person and number often showing who is expected to perform a certain action; cf xc3x89 melhor voltares "it is better {for you] to go back" xc3x89 melhor voltarmos "it is better {for us] to go back" perhaps for this reason infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in portuguese than in other romance languageswriting system{edit]written varietiesportugal and non-1990 agreement countriesbrazil and 1990 agreement
