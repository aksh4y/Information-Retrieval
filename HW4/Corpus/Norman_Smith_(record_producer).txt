successful recordings proved elusive capitalising on his solo recording efforts smith undertook two tours of the then thriving north of england cabaret circuit complete with band and dancers smith enlisted the help of session drummer peter boita who "fixed" a band for smith which was mostly made up of the temporarily disbanded "bob miller and the millermen" band this line-up went on to record

west midlands based radio presenter tony butler adopted as his theme music playing it frequently on his sports show in an attempt often successful to encourage the region's local football teams to score a goal fans of aston villa fc also consider this tune as their unofficial club theme and it can often be heard played at villa park during the pre-match and half-time intervals it was performed
