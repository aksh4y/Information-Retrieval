region of southern ontario canada the original settlement known as gravelly bay dates from 1832 {5] and was renamed after sir john colborne a british war hero and the lieutenant governor of upper canada at the time of the opening of the (new) southern terminus of the first welland canal in 1833contents1 history2 economy21 environmental concerns3 climate4 communities5 culture6 education7 demographics8 notable people9 references10 external linkshistory{edit]in pre-colonial times the neutral indians lived in the area due in part to the ready availability of flint and chert from outcroppings on the onondaga escarpment{6] this advantage was diminished by the introduction of firearms by european traders and they were driven out by the iroquois around 1650 as part of the beaver warsoriginally called gravelly bay after the shallow bedrock-floored bay upon which it sits the modern city of port colborne traces its roots back to the united empire loyalist settlements that grew up in the area following the american revolution growth became focused around the southern terminus of the welland canal after it was extended to reach lake erie in 1833 as the population rose port colborne was incorporated as a village in 1870 became a town in 1918 merged with the neighbouring village of humberstone in 1952 and was re-incorporated as a city in 1966 in 1970 niagara region municipal restructuring added humberstone township further expanding the city{7]{8]sometime during the 1880s american tourists from the southern states began building vacation homes on the lakeshore of the western edge of the town before long an entire gated community of vacationers from the south called port colborne their home during the summer months{9] today the picturesque street of tennessee avenue is still home to many of these original vacation homes and buildings as well as the original stone and wrought iron resort gates the street boasts some immaculately maintained examples of late 19th and early 20th century southern architectureport colborne was one of the hardest hit communities during the blizzard of 1977 thousands of people were stranded when the city was paralyzed during the storm and the incident remains one of significance to the local population{10]economy{edit]maritime commerce including supplying goods to the camps for the labourers who worked on the first canal ship repair and the provisioning trade was and still is an important part of port colborne's economy like other cities in the region port colborne was a heavily industrial city throughout most of the early 20th century a grain elevator two modern flour mills{11]{12] a vale nickel refinery{13] a cement plant operated by port colborne canada cement and a blast furnace operated by algoma steel were all major employers however several of these operations have closed over the past thirty years{when?] while those companies that remain now employ significantly fewer residents due to modernization and cutbacks{citation needed]in more recent years{when?] port colborne has been successful attracting new industry such as the agro-business operations of casco inc{14] and jungbunzlauer{15] which process corn into products such as sweeteners and citric acid however the economy has gradually shifted towards tourism and recreation taking advantage of the scenic beauty of the lakeshore{citation needed]the international nickel company (now vale) has long been one of the city's main employers since the opening of a refinery in 1918 taking advantage of inexpensive hydroelectricity from generating stations at nearby niagara falls the refinery produced electro-refined nickel for the war effort and grew to employ over 2000 workers by the 1950s cutbacks in operations and increasing factory automation have reduced the workforce to its present-day total of 190{16]marine recycling corporation is a ship recycling firm located next to the welland canal at gravelly bay and operating since the 1970senvironmental concerns{edit]emissions from inco's base metal refinery closed in 1984 resulted in soils contaminated with concentrations of nickel copper and cobalt above the ontario ministry of the environment's "soil remediation criteria"{17] however two studies one in 1997 and another in 1999 found "{no] adverse health effects which may have resulted from environmental exposures"{17] after a series of public meetings between the city the ministry of the environment (moe) and inco it was decided to perform a community-based risk assessment a process designed to determine whether the contamination poses a threat to the current past or future residents of port colborne and what inco must do to clean up the contaminated areas{18]some residents launched a class-action lawsuit against inco in 2001{19]{20] seeking 750 million in damages to health property value and quality-of-life although this suit failed to be certified in 2002{21]{22] it was subsequently modified to limit the class and focus solely on devaluation of property{23] and was certified on appeal on november 18 2005{24]{25] a timeline of the case has been written from the point of view of the plaintiffs{26]on july 6 2010 the ontario supreme court sided with the residents and awarded more than 7000 households in port colborne a total of 36 million households in the rodney street area in the shadow of the nickel refinery were each awarded 23000 while those living on the east and west sides of port colborne were each awarded 9000 and 2500 respectively{27] vale appealed the ruling to the ontario court of appeal who found in 2010 that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence of economic harm raising the legal burden of proof but not invalidating rylands v fletcher as precedent law{28]{29]{30] in april 2012 the supreme court of canada sided with vale and denied the residents the awarded compensation{31]{32] court costs in the amount of cad1766000 were awarded the defendant by henderson j{26]climate{edit]climate data for port colborne (1981xe2x88x922010)monthjanfebmaraprmayjunjulaugsepoctnovdecyearrecord high xc2xb0c

important role played by the welland canal in the history of the city originating as a small fair held at the port colborne historical and marine museum it has grown to feature live music an antique car show fireworks tall ships a kite festival and food from around the globe the festival also highlights the presence of lock 8 which at 420 m (1380xc2xa0ft) is one of the world's longest canal locks{33] the lock is intended as a guard to keep the water level on the welland canal constant independent of weather on the lake hence the ships are only raised or lowered one to four feet depending on the current water level in lake erie much of the festival centres around west st which runs along the side of the canal and has an excellent view of the clarence st bridge built in 1929 one of very few remaining lift bridges on the canalthe port colborne historical and marine museum located near the centre of town is a resource for local history and archival research in addition to a collection
