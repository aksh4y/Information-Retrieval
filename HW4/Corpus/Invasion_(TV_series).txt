aired on abc for one season beginning in september 21 2005 somewhat similar to invasion of the body snatchers the show told the story of the aftermath of a hurricane in which water-based creatures infiltrate a small florida town and begin to take over the bodies of the town's inhabitants through a cloning process (by first merging with then replacing them) the show was produced by shaun cassidy productions and warner bros televisiondue to hurricane katrina in 2005 and the aftermath in the southern united states early on-air promotions were quickly pulled by abc the advertising then switched emphasis completely to the alien invasion aspect of the series while the hurricane received no mention the premiere was also preceded with a warning that the show featured images of a fictional hurricane that viewers could be sensitive tocontents1 cast and characters2 episodes3 reception4 broadcast history41 ratings troubles5 future plotlines6 soundtrack7 dvd releases8 references9 external

fun show{9]shaun cassidy said a similar statement about the show's cancellation: "i think there were unrealistic expectations that any show following lost should do better but no show after ours ever did do better so i suspect some of the execs may have regretted taking our show off the air" {10] to the question "of all the shows youxe2x80x99ve created that were canceled far too soon which hurt the most  and why?" cassidy personally picked invasion because "it was the most surprising"broadcast history{edit]the series premiered on abc on september 21 2005 and aired for one season the series
