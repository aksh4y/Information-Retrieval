5000xc2xa0people were left homeless and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon damage on the island totaled 7008500000000000000xe2x99xa0us500xc2xa0million which warranted the retirement of its name paka also caused minor damage in the northern mariana islands and overall the typhoon caused no reported fatalitiescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations and impact21 marshall islands22 guam23 northern mariana islands3 aftermath31 retirement4 see also5 references6 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleas the weather synoptics of the northern pacific ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern convection from the monsoon trough extended to the east of the international date line during late november a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs on opposite sides of the equator; the one in the southern hemisphere ultimately developed into tropical cyclone pam while the one in the northern hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2000xc2xa0km (1240xc2xa0mi) southwest of hawaii the disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward and on november 28 it developed into tropical depression five-c about 465xc2xa0km (290xc2xa0mi) west-northwest of palmyra atoll operationally the central pacific hurricane center (cphc) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until december 2{2]{3]{4]{5]the tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward and failed to strengthen significantly it turned to the west on december 1 due to the presence of a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the international date line on december 2 based on satellite estimates the cphc upgraded the depression to tropical storm paka while located about 1000xc2xa0km (625xc2xa0mi) south-southeast of johnston atoll due to the presence of high clouds across the area forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation after becoming a tropical storm paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest it steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures and on december 3 the storm attained winds of 105xc2xa0kmh (65xc2xa0mph) the next day however it encountered dry air and began weakening; by december 6 the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12xc2xa0hours subsequently paka began to re-intensify and on december 7 the storm crossed the international date line into the western north pacific ocean with winds of 80xc2xa0kmh (50xc2xa0mph){2]{5]upon entering the western north pacific ocean tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the cphc to the japan meteorological agency (jma) and the jma first assessed paka as a 65xc2xa0km (40xc2xa0mph) storm{6] the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the united states department of defense paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line and from late on december 7 through early the following day it remained a strong tropical storm however upper-level wind shear increased and it again weakened at 1200xc2xa0utc on december 9 the jtwc assessed paka as an 85xc2xa0kmh (50xc2xa0mph) tropical storm and forecast it to continue weakening by december 10 the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the marshall islands and that night the jtwc upgraded paka to typhoon status{4] paka officially attained typhoon status when jma classified it with winds of 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) at 0000xc2xa0utc on december 11{6]super typhoon paka on december 15after attaining typhoon status paka strengthened fairly quickly and by december 12 it reached sustained winds of 150xc2xa0kmh (90xc2xa0mph) for a ten-minute (10 min) duration{6] or 215xc2xa0kmh (135xc2xa0mph) over a one-minute (1 min) duration subsequently it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased however paka again re-intensified and at 1200xc2xa0utc on december 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open pacific ocean{4] at the same time the jma classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175xc2xa0kmh (110xc2xa0mph){6] after reaching its initial peak intensity typhoon paka began to weaken as it approached the southern mariana islands; the nexrad doppler weather radar from guam revealed the presence of a primary eyewall of 74xc2xa0km (46xc2xa0mi) in diameter with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19xc2xa0km (11xc2xa0mi) in diameter{4] additionally satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon{7] it slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward and at 0530xc2xa0utc on december 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of paka passed over the island of rota; 20xc2xa0minutes later the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern guam{4] as it tracked through the rota channel the center of paka passed about 8xc2xa0km (5xc2xa0mi) north of the northern tip of guam its closest approach to the island{8]typhoon paka continued to steadily intensify after passing the marianas islands and late on december 17 it reached its peak intensity of 185xc2xa0kmh (115xc2xa0mph 10 min sustained) while located 440xc2xa0km (275xc2xa0mi) west-northwest of guam{6] early on december 18 the jtwc assessed it as attaining peak winds of 295xc2xa0kmh (185xc2xa0mph 1 min winds){4] on december 19 it entered the area of responsibility of the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration or pagasa and was named rubing{9] shortly thereafter paka moved through an area of progressively increasing wind shear which resulted in a steady weakening trend{7] by december 21 winds decreased to tropical storm status the next day it degenerated into a tropical depression before it dissipated on december 23{6]preparations and impact{edit]marshall islands{edit]prior to the typhoon passing through the marshall islands several hundred residents on the island of ebeye fled to safer structures the threat of paka prevented continental micronesia from flying in or out of the area{10]paka entered the marshall islands between mili and majuro as a tropical storm on december 10 and after strengthening into a typhoon it left the archipelago on december 14{8] the cyclone affected several islands in the nation and the majuro and kwajalein atolls reported wind gusts in excess of 75xc2xa0kmh (45xc2xa0mph){4] on jaluit atoll the typhoon dropped 217xc2xa0mm (854xc2xa0in) of precipitation in six hours with a total of about 300xc2xa0mm (118xc2xa0in) recorded in 30xc2xa0hours{11] strong waves inundated low-lying islands which flooded crops with salt water{10] the combination of the wind and flooding caused severe damage to banana papaya and lime trees across the territory{8] typhoon paka damaged 70 of the houses on ailinglaplap atoll and most of the coconut trees on the atoll were left toppled or damaged strong winds left large portions of ebeye island without electricity or telephone{10] the typhoon caused no reported deaths or injuries in the region and damage was estimated at 7007800000000000000xe2x99xa0us80xc2xa0million{8]guam{edit]damage on guamthe guam national weather service issued a typhoon watch on december 14 which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day the antonio b won pat international airport was closed during the passage of paka with only emergency flights permitted{8]passing a short distance north of the island typhoon paka produced strong winds across northern guam though reliable wind reports are incomplete due to the long duration and intensity of the winds the highest reading believed to be reliable was at apra harbor there a station recorded a wind gust of 277xc2xa0kmh (171xc2xa0mph) before the sensor failed as winds shifted to the southwest; since the winds from the southwest were stronger and of greater duration officials believe gusts there reached 297xc2xa0kmh (184xc2xa0mph){4] additionally andersen air force base recorded a peak wind gust of 381xc2xa0kmh (236xc2xa0mph){12] which at the time was considered the highest wind speed on record surpassing the 1934 world record of 372xc2xa0kmh (231xc2xa0mph) on mount washington in new hampshire{13] however a subsequent wind survey of the area discarded the reading at the base as it was considered unreliable{12] as microbarographs are less exposed than wind sensors pressure readings on the island are considered accurate; the lowest reading on the island was 948xc2xa0hpa (2799xc2xa0inhg) at andersen air force base{4] in two days the typhoon dropped about 533xc2xa0mm (21xc2xa0in) of precipitation on the northern portion of the island or about 89 of the monthly rainfall total{14] waves along northern guam reached about 11xc2xa0m (35xc2xa0ft) in height{15]the strong winds from paka left around 1500xc2xa0buildings destroyed on the island{15] of which 1160 were single-family homes{8] a further 10000xc2xa0buildings sustained damage to some degree{15] with 60 of the homes on the island reporting major damage{8] in all about 5000xc2xa0people were left homeless due to the typhoon additionally an estimated 30xe2x80x9340 of the public buildings received major damage{8] buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well as opposed to light metal-frame structures which more often than not were destroyed large tourist hotels near hagxc3xa5txc3xb1a on which guam is dependent received generally minor damage such as broken windows and damaged power generators{15]a damaged business at agaxc3xb1aa complete island-wide power outage followed the typhoon; damage to the main electrical transmission and distribution system was estimated at 7007160000000000000xe2x99xa0usd16xc2xa0million following the passage of the typhoon 25 of the homes on guam were left without water{8] telephone service remained working after the storm due to most lines being underground strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island leaving them temporarily closed the waves surpassed the seawall at apra harbor damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport; many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the antonio b won pat international airport though most airport facilities received light damage andersen air force base also sustained heavy damage with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged{15] across guam damage was estimated at 7008500000000000000xe2x99xa0usd500xc2xa0million{8] about 100xc2xa0people were injured{16] but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island{8]nexrad image of typhoon paka from guamnorthern mariana islands{edit]a typhoon watch was issued for rota tinian and saipan on december 14 which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day{8] because paka was intensifying while passing to the south of rota the first wind or northeast through east winds was less severe than the second wind from the southeast{4] sustained winds on the island reached 145xc2xa0kmh (90xc2xa0mph) with gusts reaching 185xc2xa0kmh (115xc2xa0mph){8] many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird{17] while passing to the south of the island paka dropped 250xe2x80x93300xc2xa0mm (10xe2x80x9312xc2xa0in) of rain{14] damage on the island totaled 44xc2xa0million (1997xc2xa0usd 64xc2xa0million 2015xc2xa0usd){8] the typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on saipan{14]aftermath{edit]following the passage of the typhoon in the ailinglaplap atoll in the marshall islands residents experienced severe food shortages due to damaged crops and little rainfall experts estimated the entire redevelopment of its fauna would require more than a decade as a result of the crop shortage large-scale evacuations of the islands' residents were considered officials in the nation requested assistance from the federal emergency management agency of the united states{18] and on march 20 1998 the area was declared a disaster area; the declaration allowed for the usage of emergency funds{19]on december 17 1997 president bill clinton declared guam a federal disaster area making it eligible for federal assistance{20] one week later a disaster declaration was ordered for the northern mariana islands{21] ultimately fema received 14770xc2xa0individual assistance applications from residents on guam in turn fema provided the residents with over 27xc2xa0million in assistance (1997xc2xa0usd 39xc2xa0million 2015xc2xa0usd){22] the entire island of guam was left without power after paka water and sewage systems on guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon with the usage of power generators most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities within a few days after the typhoon the antonio b won pat international airport was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon and by a week after the passage of paka the airport was fully re-opened{15]retirement{edit]due to the heavy damage from the typhoon the central pacific hurricane center requested the retirement of the name in april 2006;
