linksbackground{edit]grace jones' previous album bulletproof heart was released in 1989 and despite several comeback attempts throughout the 1990s her next full-length record would be released almost two decades later the singer had decided "never to do an album again"{13] changing her mind only after meeting the music producer ivor guest via mutual friend philip treacy after becoming acquainted guest played jones a track he had been working on and she set her lyrics "devil in my life" to it they ended up recording as many as 23 tracks some of which may be part of a future project{14] in 2007 guest announced that he and jones had completed recording the albumthe album includes a number of autobiographical songs these include "this is" "williams' blood" and "i'm crying (mother's tears)" "love you to life" is another track based on real events and "corporate cannibal" refers to the subject of corporate capitalism the title track was first recorded as a 1997 collaboration with tricky under the title "cradle to the grave" "well well well" is dedicated to the memory of alex sadkin who had died in 1987 having co-produced three of jones' 1980s albums "sunset sunrise" ponders mankind's relationship with nature and the final song "devil in my life" was written after a party in venice while jones was standing in the corner observing partygoers{14] four songs were ultimately removed from the track listing: "the key to funky" (co-written by jones and diane pernet in the late '80s) "body phenomenon" "sister sister" and "misery" another track recorded by jones "volunteer" was leaked in 2007 by leslie winer together with "this" an early version of "this is"{15] winer also asserted that she had written both songs with joe galdo in the early 1990s{16] mainly with sly and robbie wally badarou barry reynolds mikey chung and uziah "sticky" thompson aka the compass point allstars as a backbone the album retained the reggae-influenced sound of her three compass point albums even though it was not recorded at the legendary studios in the bahamasoriginally rumoured to be titled corporate cannibal{17] the album's final title hurricane and the release date of 27 october were announced in june 2008 at her signing with wall of sound{18] the album was released on wall of sound on november 3 2008 in the united kingdom pias the parent company of wall of sound distributed hurricane worldwide excluding north america{19] it met with positive reception obtaining a score of 72 out of 100 on review aggregator metacritic{20]prior to the release jones performed a two-hour concert at massive attack's meltdown festival in london on 19 june 2008 during which she performed four new songs from the album and premiered the music video for the first single "corporate cannibal"{21]{22] for further album promotion jones appeared on british television talk show friday night with jonathan ross several awards galas and embarked on the hurricane tour in january 2009 which garnered positive reviewsthree years after the original hurricane release jones released a dub version of the album hurricane xe2x80x93 dub came out on september 5 2011 the dub versions were made by ivor guest with contributions from adam green frank byng robert logan and ben cowanjones dedicated the album to the memory of her father bishop robert w jones"{23]artwork{edit]the front and
