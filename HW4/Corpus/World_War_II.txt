war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 although related conflicts began earlier it involved the vast majority of the world's countriesxe2x80x94including all of the great powersxe2x80x94eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the allies and the axis it was the most widespread war in history and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries in a state of total war the major participants threw their entire economic industrial and scientific capabilities behind the war effort erasing the distinction between civilian and military resourcesworld war ii was the deadliest conflict in human history marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities most of which were civilians in the soviet union and china it included massacres the deliberate genocide of the holocaust strategic bombing starvation disease and the first use of nuclear weapons in history{1]{2]{3]{4]the empire of japan aimed to dominate asia and the pacific and was already at war with the republic of china in 1937{5] but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 september 1939{6] with the invasion of poland by nazi germany and subsequent declarations of war on germany by france and the united kingdom supplied by the soviet union from late 1939 to early 1941 in a series of campaigns and treaties germany conquered or controlled much of continental europe and formed the axis alliance with italy and japan under the molotovxe2x80x93ribbentrop pact of august 1939 germany and the soviet union partitioned and annexed territories of their european neighbours poland finland romania and the baltic states the war continued primarily between the european axis powers and the coalition of the united kingdom and the british commonwealth with campaigns including the north africa and east africa campaigns the aerial battle of britain the blitz bombing campaign and the balkan campaign as well as the long-running battle of the atlantic on 22 june 1941 the european axis powers launched an invasion of the soviet union opening the largest land theatre of war in history which trapped the major part of the axis military forces into a war of attrition in december 1941 japan attacked the united states and european colonies in the pacific ocean and quickly conquered much of the western pacificthe axis advance halted in 1942 when japan lost the critical battle of midway and germany and italy were defeated in north africa and then decisively at stalingrad in the soviet union in 1943 with a series of german defeats on the eastern front the allied invasion of sicily and the allied invasion of italy which brought about italian surrender and allied victories in the pacific the axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts in 1944 the western allies invaded german-occupied france while the soviet union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded germany and its allies during 1944 and 1945 the japanese suffered major reverses in mainland asia in south central china and burma while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islandsthe war in europe concluded with an invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union culminating in the capture of berlin by soviet troops the suicide of adolf hitler and the subsequent german unconditional surrender on 8 may 1945 following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 and the refusal of japan to surrender under its terms the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki on 6 august and 9 august respectively with an invasion of the japanese archipelago imminent the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the soviet invasion of manchuria japan formally surrendered on 2 september 1945 thus ended the war in asia cementing the total victory of the alliesworld warxc2xa0ii changed the political alignment and social structure of the world the united nations (un) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts the victorious great powersxe2x80x94china france the soviet union the united kingdom and the united statesxe2x80x94became the permanent members of the united nations security council{7] the soviet union and the united states emerged as rival superpowers setting the stage for the cold war which lasted for the next 46 years meanwhile the influence of european great powers waned while the decolonisation of africa and asia began most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery political integration especially in europe emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity{8]contents1 chronology2 background21 europe22 asia3 pre-war events31 italian

start of the war in europe is generally held to be 1 september 1939{9]{10] beginning with the german invasion of poland; britain and france declared war on germany two days later the dates for the beginning of war in the pacific include the start of the second sino-japanese war on 7 july 1937{11]{12] or even the japanese invasion of manchuria on 19 september 1931{13]{14]others follow the british historian a j p taylor who held that the sino-japanese war and war in europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941 this article uses the conventional dating other starting dates sometimes used for world warxc2xa0ii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on 3 october 1935{15] the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september 1939{16]the exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 august 1945 (v-j day) rather than the formal surrender of japan (2 september 1945) a peace treaty with japan was signed in 1951{17] a treaty regarding germany's future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-world war ii issues{18]backgroundmain article: causes of world war iieuropeworld war i had radically altered the political european map with the defeat of the central powersxe2x80x94including austria-hungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empirexe2x80x94and the 1917 bolshevik seizure of power in russia which eventually led to the founding of the soviet union meanwhile the victorious allies of world war i such as france belgium italy romania and greece gained territory and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of austria-hungary and the ottoman and russian empiresthe league of nations assembly held in geneva switzerland 1930to prevent a future world war the league of nations was created during the 1919 paris peace conference the organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security military and naval disarmament and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitrationdespite strong pacifist sentiment after world war i{19] its aftermath still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several european states these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial colonial and financial losses incurred by the treaty of versailles under the treaty germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory and all of its overseas possessions while german annexation of other states was prohibited reparations were imposed and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces{20]the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of 1918xe2x80x931919 and a democratic government later known as the weimar republic was created the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left italy as an entente ally had made some post-war territorial gains; however italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by britain and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement from 1922 to 1925 the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist totalitarian and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy repressed socialist left-wing and liberal forces and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power promising the creation of a "new roman empire"{21]adolf hitler at a german national socialist political rally in weimar october 1930adolf hitler after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in 1923 eventually became the chancellor of germany in 1933 he abolished democracy espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order and soon began a massive rearmament campaign{22] meanwhile france to secure its alliance allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia which italy desired as a colonial possession the situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription{23]to contain germany the united kingdom france and italy formed the stresa front in april 1935; however that june the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany easing prior restrictions the soviet union concerned by germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france before taking effect though the franco-soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations which rendered it essentially toothless{24] the united states concerned with events in europe and asia passed the neutrality act in august of the same year{25]hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march 1936 encountering little opposition{26] in october 1936 germany and italy formed the romexe2x80x93berlin axis a month later germany and japan signed the anti-comintern pact which italy would join in the following yearasiathe kuomintang (kmt) party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mid-1920s but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party allies{27] and new regional warlords in 1931 an increasingly militaristic empire of japan which had long sought influence in china{28] as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule asia used the mukden incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo{29]too weak to resist japan china appealed to the league of nations for help japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria the two nations then fought several battles in shanghai rehe and hebei until the tanggu truce was signed in 1933 thereafter chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria and chahar and suiyuan{30] after the 1936 xi'an incident the kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan{31]pre-war

italoxe2x80x93abyssinian war was a brief colonial war that began in october 1935 and ended in may 1936 the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire (also known as abyssinia) by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy (regno d'italia) which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea{32] the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa (africa orientale italiana or aoi); in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace both italy and ethiopia were member nations but the league did nothing when the former clearly violated the league's article x{33] germany was the only major european nation to support the invasion italy subsequently dropped its objections to germany's goal of absorbing austria{34]spanish civil war (1936xe2x80x9339)main article: spanish civil warthe bombing of guernica in 1937 during the spanish civil war sparked europe-wide fears that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualtieswhen civil war broke out in spain hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels led by general francisco franco the soviet union supported the existing government the spanish republic over 30000 foreign volunteers known as the international brigades also fought against the nationalists both germany and the ussr used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics the nationalists won the civil war in april 1939; franco now dictator remained officially neutral during second world war but generally favoured the axis{35] his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front{36]japanese invasion of china (1937)main article: second sino-japanese warjapanese imperial army soldiers during the battle of shanghai 1937in july 1937 japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china{37] the soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with china to lend materiel support effectively ending china's prior co-operation with germany from september to november the japanese attacked taiyuan{38]{39] as well as engaging the kuomintang army around xinkou{38]{39] and communist forces in pingxingguan{40]{41] generalissimo chiang kai-shek deployed his best army to defend shanghai but after three months of fighting shanghai fell the japanese continued to push the chinese forces back capturing the capital nanking in december 1937 after the fall of nanking tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the japanese{42]{43]in march 1938 nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang but then the city of xuzhou was taken by japanese in may{44] in june 1938 chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river; this manoeuvre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan but the city was taken by october{45] japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve; instead the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war{46]{47]sovietxe2x80x93japanese border conflictsred army artillery unit during the battle of lake khasan 1938main article: sovietxe2x80x93japanese border conflictsin the mid-to-late 1930s japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and the mongolian people's republic the japanese doctrine of hokushin-ron which emphasised japan's expansion northward was favoured by the imperial army during this time with the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in 1939 the ongoing second sino-japanese war{48] and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets this policy would prove difficult to maintain japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april 1941 and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshin-ron promoted by the navy which took its focus southward eventually leading to its war with the united states and the western allies{49]{50]european occupations and agreementsfurther information: anschluss appeasement munich agreement german

italy were becoming more aggressive in march 1938 germany annexed austria again provoking little response from other european powers{51] encouraged hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population; and soon britain and france followed the counsel of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands{52] soon afterwards germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary and poland annexed czechoslovakia's zaolzie region{53]although all of germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish "war-mongers" and in january 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy in march 1939 germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a pro-german client state the slovak republic{54] hitler also delivered an ultimatum to lithuania forcing the concession of the klaipxc4x97da regiongreatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig britain and france guaranteed their support for polish independence; when italy conquered albania in april 1939 the same guarantee was extended to romania and greece{55] shortly after the franco-british pledge to poland germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel{56] hitler accused britain and poland of trying to "encircle" germany and renounced the anglo-german naval agreement and the germanxe2x80x93polish non-aggression pactgerman foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop (right) and the soviet leader joseph stalin after signing the molotovxe2x80x93ribbentrop pact 23 august 1939in august 1939 germany and the soviet union signed the molotovxe2x80x93ribbentrop pact{57] a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol the parties gave each other rights to "spheres of influence" (western poland and lithuania for germany; eastern poland finland estonia latvia and bessarabia for the ussr) it also raised the question of continuing polish independence{58] the agreement was crucial to hitler because it assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war as it had in world war i after it defeated polandthe situation reached a general crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border in a private meeting with the italian foreign minister count ciano hitler asserted that poland was a "doubtful neutral" that needed to either yield to his demands or be "liquidated" to prevent it from drawing off german troops in the future "unavoidable" war with the western democracies he did not believe britain or france would intervene in the conflict{59] on 23 august hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 august but upon hearing that britain had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality he decided to delay it{60]in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war germany made demands on poland which only served as a pretext to worsen relations{61] on 29 august hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession{61] the poles refused to comply with the german demands and on the night of 30xe2x80x9331 august in a violent meeting with the british ambassador neville henderson ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected{62]course of the warfurther information: diplomatic history of world war iiwar breaks out in europe (1939xe2x80x9340)main articles: invasion of poland phoney war occupation of poland

however initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to poland consisting of a cautious half-hearted french probe into the saarland{66] the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort{67] germany responded by ordering u-boat warfare against allied merchant and warships which was to later escalate into the battle of the atlanticgerman tanks near the city of bydgoszcz during the invasion of poland september 1939on 17 september 1939 after signing a cease-fire with japan the soviets invaded poland from the east{68] the polish army was defeated and warsaw surrendered to the germans on 27 september with final pockets of resistance surrendering on 6 october poland's territory was divided between germany and the soviet union with lithuania and slovakia also receiving small shares after the defeat of poland's armed forces the polish resistance established an underground state and a partisan home army{69] about 100000 polish military personnel were evacuated to romania and the baltic countries; many of these soldiers later fought against the germans in other theatres of the war{70] poland's enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to france{71]on 6 october hitler made a public peace overture to britain and france but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union chamberlain rejected this on 12 october saying "past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present german government"{62] after this rejection hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france{72] but bad weather forced repeated postponements until the spring of 1940{73]{74]{75]german and soviet army officers pictured

rejected territorial demands prompting a soviet invasion in november 1939{79] the resulting winter war ended in march 1940 with finnish concessions{80] britain and france treating the soviet attack on finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the germans responded to the soviet invasion by supporting the ussr's expulsion from the league of nations{78]in june 1940 the soviet union forcibly annexed estonia latvia and lithuania{77] and the disputed romanian regions of bessarabia northern bukovina and hertza meanwhile nazi-soviet political rapprochement and economic co-operation{81]{82] gradually stalled{83]{pagexc2xa0needed]{84] and both states began preparations for war{85]western europe (1940xe2x80x9341)main article: western front (world war ii)map of the french maginot linein april 1940 germany invaded denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden which the allies were attempting to cut off by unilaterally mining neutral norwegian waters{86] denmark capitulated after a few hours and despite allied support during which the important harbour of narvik temporarily was recaptured from the germans norway was conquered within two months{87] british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the replacement of the british prime minister neville chamberlain with winston churchill on 10 may 1940{88]germany launched an offensive against france and adhering to the manstein plan also attacked the neutral nations of belgium the netherlands and luxembourg on 10 may 1940{89] that same day british forces landed in iceland and the faroes to preempt a possible german invasion of the islands{90] the us in close co-operation with the danish envoy to washington dc agreed to protect greenland laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in april 1941 the netherlands and belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks respectively{91] the french-fortified maginot line and the main body of the allied forces which had moved into belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded ardennes region{92] mistakenly perceived by allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles{93]{94] as a result the bulk of the allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten the majority were taken prisoner whilst over 300000 mostly british and french were evacuated from the continent at dunkirk by early june although abandoning almost all of their equipment{95]on 10 june italy invaded france declaring war on both france and the united kingdom{96] paris fell to the germans on 14 june and eight days later france signed an armistice with germany and was soon divided into german and italian occupation zones{97] and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime which though officially neutral was generally aligned with germany france kept its fleet but the british feared the germans would seize it so on 3 july the british attacked it{98]view of london after the german blitz 29 december 1940the battle of britain{99] began in early july with luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours{100] on 19 july hitler again publicly offered to end the war saying he had no desire to destroy the british empire the united kingdom rejected this ultimatum{101] the main german air superiority campaign started in august but failed to defeat raf fighter command and a proposed invasion was postponed indefinitely on 17 september the german strategic bombing offensive intensified as night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz but largely failed to disrupt the british war effort{100]german luftwaffe heinkel he 111 bombers during the battle of britainusing newly captured french ports the german navy enjoyed success against an over-extended royal navy using u-boats against british shipping in the atlantic{102] the british scored a significant victory on 27 may 1941 by sinking the german battleship bismarck{103] perhaps most importantly during the battle of britain the royal air force had successfully resisted the luftwaffe's assault and the german bombing campaign largely ended in may 1941{104]throughout this period the neutral united states took measures to assist china and the western allies in november 1939 the american neutrality act was amended to allow "cash and carry" purchases by the allies{105] in 1940 following the german capture of paris the size of the united states navy was significantly increased in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases{106] still a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941{107]although roosevelt had promised to keep the united states out of the war he nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war in december 1940 he accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as useless calling for the us to become an "arsenal of democracy" and promoted the passage of lend-lease aid to support the british war effort{101] in january 1941 secret high level staff talks with the british began for the purposes of determining how to defeat germany should the us enter the war they decided on a number of offensive policies including an air offensive the "early elimination" of italy raids support of resistance groups and the capture of positions to launch an offensive against germany{108]at the end of september 1940 the tripartite pact united japan italy and germany to formalise the axis powers the tripartite pact stipulated that any country with the exception of the soviet union not in the war which attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three{109] the axis expanded in november 1940 when hungary slovakia and romania joined the tripartite pact{110] romania would make a major contribution (as did hungary) to the axis war against the

called for the end of american aid to china and for the supply of oil and other resources to japan in exchange japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina{158] the american counter-proposal of 26 november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all pacific powers{160] that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force;{161] the japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war{162]japan planned to rapidly seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific; the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the over-stretched allies by fighting a defensive war{163] to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset{164] on 7 december 1941 (8 december in asian time zones) japan attacked british and american holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific{165] these included an attack on the american fleet at pearl harbor the philippines landings in thailand and malaya{165] and the battle of hong kongthese attacks led the united states britain china australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan whereas the soviet union being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with european axis countries maintained its neutrality agreement with japan{166] germany followed by the other axis states declared war on the united states{167] in solidarity with japan citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been

argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength leading to increasing demoralisation and bolster resistance forces germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using large-scale armies{171] eventually the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa{172]at the casablanca conference in early 1943 the allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 declaration by the united nations and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading

japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea{181] japan's next plan motivated by the earlier doolittle raid was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska{182] in mid-may japan started the zhejiang-jiangxi campaign in china with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the chinese 23rd and 32nd army groups{183]{184] in early june

1943 the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops{189] in burma commonwealth forces mounted two operations the first an offensive into the arakan region in late 1942 went

photographed just before their execution by german soldiers in palmiry forest 1940in europe occupation came under two forms in western northern and central europe (france norway denmark the low countries and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia) germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 695 billion reichmarks (278 billion us dollars) by the end of the war this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products military equipment raw materials and other goods{367] thus the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income germany collected from taxation a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total german income as the war went on{368]russian academy of sciences reported in 1995 civilian victims in the soviet union at german hands totalled 137 million dead twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied ussrin the east the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders{369] unlike in the west the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior people" of slavic descent; most german advances were thus followed by mass executions{370] although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories they did not significantly hamper german operations in either the east{371] or the west{372] until late 1943in asia japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples{373] although japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from european domination in some territories their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks{374] during japan's initial conquest it captured 4000000 barrels (640000xc2xa0m3) of oil (55xc3x97105 tonnes) left behind by retreating allied forces and by 1943 was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to 50 million barrels (68xc3x9710^6xc2xa0t) 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate{374]home fronts and productionmain articles: military production during world war ii and home front during world war iiallied to axis gdp ratioin europe before the outbreak of the war the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics in 1938 the western allies (united kingdom france poland and british dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers (germany and italy); if colonies are included it then gives the allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in gdp{375] in asia at the same time china had roughly six times the population of japan but only an 89 per cent higher gdp; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included{375]the united states provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the allies in terms of warships transports warplanes artillery tanks trucks and ammunition{376] though the allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan they became the decisive factor by 1942 after the united states and soviet union joined the allies as the war largely settled into one of attrition{377] while the allies' ability to out-produce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources other factors such as germany and japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force{378] allied strategic bombing{379] and germany's late shift to a war economy{380] contributed significantly additionally neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war and were not equipped to do so{381] to improve their production germany and japan used millions of slave labourers;{382] germany used about 12 million people mostly from eastern europe{352] while japan used more than 18 million people in far east asia{360]{361]advances in technology and warfaremain

bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war){384] anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery such as the german 88 mm gun the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and though late introduction meant it had little impact it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide{385]advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at taranto pearl harbor and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship{386]{387]{388]in the atlantic escort carriers proved to be a vital part of allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the mid-atlantic gap{389] carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft{390] and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured{391] submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war{392] were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second the british focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics{393] gradually improving allied technologies such as the leigh light hedgehog squid and homing torpedoes proved victoriousa v-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in peenemxc3xbcnde 21 june 1943land warfare changed from the static front lines of world warxc2xa0i to increased mobility and combined arms the tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war had evolved into the primary weapon{394] in the late 1930s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i{395] and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepowerat the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications{396] this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and german doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat this along with germany's use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france{394] many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled) mines short-ranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used{396] even with large-scale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces{397] and throughout the war

development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces{399]most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines the most well known being the german enigma machine{400] development of sigint (signals

enigma benefiting from information given to britain by the polish cipher bureau which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war{402] another aspect of military intelligence was the use
