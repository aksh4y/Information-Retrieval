was the twelfth tropical storm in the 2003 atlantic hurricane season it was one of eight storms to impact mexico from either the pacific or atlantic oceans in the season a near-record larry formed in early october from an extratropical storm in the bay of campeche and reached a peak intensity of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) due to weak steering currents the storm moved southward which resulted in the storm hitting the tabasco coastline the storm was the first tabascan landfall since tropical storm brenda in 1973{1]larry drifted across the isthmus of tehuantepec dropping heavy rainfall of over 9xc2xa0in (229xc2xa0mm) in places the rainfall led to flooding and mudslides causing damage to thousands of houses the flooding killed five people and resulted in 536xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd) in damage larry was one of three tropical cyclones to hit mexico in a short period of time including tropical depression nora and tropical storm olaf in the eastern pacific oceancontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact4 aftermath5 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 17 it moved across the shear-ridden atlantic ocean without development and remained disorganized until reaching the western caribbean sea on september 26 there the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop on the september 27 a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula the system continued to organize and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on september 29{2]dry air and land weakened the tropical wave and when it entered the area of the bay of campeche it merged with a stationary frontal boundary cool dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core and the area organized into an extratropical low on september 30 a large high pressure system over the northern gulf of mexico forced the system southward where it developed significant convection the system developed a warm core and on october 1 the storm organized into tropical storm larry while located 300xc2xa0mi (483xc2xa0km) east-southeast of tampico mexico{2]weak steering currents allowed for larry to drift westward at about twoxc2xa0mphxc2xa0 (3xc2xa0kmh) while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) on october 3 a mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast where after remaining a 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) storm for three days larry made landfall on paraxc3xadso in the mexican state of tabasco on october 5 it steadily weakened over land and degenerated into a remnant low on october 6 while midway through the isthmus of tehuantepec the remnant low turned to the southwest and reached the eastern pacific ocean on the october 7{2] the remnants of larry re-organized in the eastern pacific with the national hurricane center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on october 9{3] however the convection diminished and further development was no longer anticipated{4]preparations{edit]tropical storm larry approaching tabasco on october 4due to its erratic motion the mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch early in larry's lifetime from veracruz to campeche the watches and warnings were extended westward to tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to ciudad del carmen on october 5{2] due to the threat of the storm officials closed three pemex oil ports{5] the company used its reserves to make sure profits weren't disrupted{6] in addition the storm closed shipping ports in dos bocas in tabasco coatzacoalcos in veracruz and cayo arcas in campeche the mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert{5] while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1500xc2xa0people because of the storm the government declared much of eastern mexico a state of emergency{7]impact{edit]rainfall totals from larrytropical storm larry was one of eight storms to hit mexico from either the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean the highest since the record of nine in 1971{8] the national hurricane center expected the storm to produce a storm surge of 3 to 5xc2xa0feet (9 to 15xc2xa0m) with high waves on top{9] though no official surge readings were reported{2] the highest recorded winds on land were 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) in el alacrxc3xa1n in tabasco the worst of larry's effects came from its rainfall peaking at 2477xc2xa0inches (6292xc2xa0mm) in upper juarez in southeastern mexico{10] the highest 24-hour rainfall total was 96xc2xa0inches (2455xc2xa0mm) in tortuguero chiapas{8] while several other locations reported over 4xc2xa0inches (102xc2xa0mm) in 24xc2xa0hours{1]the flooding damaged more than 21000xc2xa0houses across mexico in combination with the damage from eastern pacific hurricanes nora and olaf{11] damage was greatest around the chiapas capital of tuxtla gutixc3xa9rrez where over 9000xc2xa0houses were affected{12] the rainfall caused mudslides across the country hospitalizing two individuals in central hidalgo the flooding also caused severe crop damage along larry's path{13] strong wind gusts caused outages to telephone and power services{8] in all larry caused five deaths{2] and 536xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 59xc2xa0million 2005xc2xa0usd){14]in el salvador rainfall from the remnants of larryxe2x80x94combined with previous rainfallxe2x80x94caused mudslides and flooding forcing several thousand people to evacuate in san salvador the flooding destroyed or damaged hundreds of houses{15]aftermath{edit]tropical storm larry hit mexico at around the same time as two other tropical storms the mexican red cross provided aid for 6587 families throughout the country while the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies launched an international appeal for aid the appeal raised 2844728 (2003xc2xa0usd) the mexican red cross distributed 4000 food and hygiene packets to various places and delivered 2750 family packets and over 4300 mattresses to citizens in chiapas as well as 5000 school kits a total of 38750xc2xa0people benefited from the operation{11]tropical cyclones portalreferences{edit]wikimedia commons has media related to tropical storm larry^ a
