populous counties of simcoe grey and bruce the main channel separates the bruce peninsula from manitoulin island and connects georgian bay to the rest of lake huron the north channel located between manitoulin island and the sudbury district west of killarney was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from georgian baythe shores and waterways of the georgian bay are the traditional domain of the anishinaabeg first nations peoples to the north and huron-petun (wyandot) to the south the bay was thus a major algonquian-huron trade route samuel de champlain the first european to explore and map the area in 1615xe2x80x931616 called it "la mer douce" (the calm sea) also a reference to the bay's freshwater{1] it was named "georgian

approximately 15000 square kilometres (5800xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) making it nearly 80 the size of lake ontario{4]{5] if georgian bay were considered a lake in its own right it would be the fourth largest lake located entirely within canada after great bear lake great slave lake and lake winnipegeastern georgian bay is part of the southern edge of the canadian shield granite bedrock exposed by the glaciers at the end of the last ice age about 11000 years ago the granite rock formations and windswept eastern white pine are characteristic of the islands and much of the shoreline of the bay the rugged beauty of the area inspired landscapes by artists of the group of seven the western part of the bay from collingwood north and including manitoulin drummond cockburn and st joseph islands borders the niagara escarpment because of its size and narrowness of the straits joining it with the rest of lake huron which is analogous to if not as pronounced as the separation of lake huron and lake michigan{6] georgian bay is sometimes called the "sixth great lake"{7]there are tens of thousands of islands in georgian bay most of these islands are along the east side of the bay and are collectively known as the "thirty thousand islands" including the larger parry island manitoulin island lying along the northern side of the bay is the world's largest island in a freshwater lake the

bayarcheological records reveal an aboriginal presence in the southern regions of the canadian shield dating from 11000 years ago evidence of later paleo-indian settlements have been found on manitoulin island and near killarney at the time of european contact the ojibwe and ottawa first nations both of whom call themselves anishinaabe (plural: anishinaabeg) lived along the northern eastern and western shores of georgian bay the huron (or wendat) and tionontati inhabited the lands along the southern coast having migrated from the northern shores of lake ontario names of islands such as "manitoulin" (from gitchi manitou the great spirit who left the bay as a source of life for the first people) and "giant's tomb" are indicative of the richness of the cultural history of the area aboriginal communities continue to live on their territories and practise their cultural traditionsthe first european to visit this area was likely xc3x89tienne brxc3xbblxc3xa9 who at age less than 20 in 1610 was sent to live as an interpreter trainee with the onontchataronon an algonquian people of the ottawa river they travelled every winter to live with the arendarhonon people of the huron (wendat) confederacy at the southern end of georgian bay in the area now called "huronia" brulxc3xa9 returned to the arendarhonon the following year at the same time another young interpreter trainee a youth remembered only as thomas who was employed by the french surgeon and trader daniel boyer also likely made it to huronia in the company of the onontchataronon another member of the confederacyin 1615 brulxc3xa9's employer the french explorer samuel de champlain made his own visit to georgian bay and overwintered in huronia he was preceded that summer by a rxc3xa9collet missionary joseph le caron who would live among the huron in 1615xe2x80x931616 and 1623xe2x80x931624 another rxc3xa9collet missionary gabriel sagard lived there from 1623xe2x80x9334 the french jesuit

hms nancy was sunk by three american vessels several weeks later nancy was avenged when british boarding parties in the de tour passage surprised and captured two of the three american vesselsthe first nautical charts of georgian bay were made in 1815 by captain william fitzwilliam owen who called it lake manitoulin captain henry bayfield who made more detailed charts of the bay renamed it in 1822 after king george iv his charts are the basis for those in use todaythe canadian hydrographic service traces its history back to 1883 when it was originally established as the georgian bay survey tasked with charting and improving knowledge of the bay after a steamship wrecked there the previous year killing 150 of its passengersover the years 32 lighthouses were built on georgian bay six of them were designed with limestone towers; these were built in the 1850s and are known collectively as the imperial towers some of the 32 can be toured by the public some cannot and some are accessible only by tour boats or private boat{8]legend of kitchikewana{edit]the waters between finger point and thumb point near cedar springs beausoleil islandwyandot legend tells of a god called kitchikewana who was large enough to guard the whole of the georgian bay kitchikewana was known for his great temper and his tribe decided the best way to calm him was with a wife they held a grand celebration and many women came kitchikewana met a woman named wanakita here he decided that this was the woman he wanted to marry and started planning the wedding immediately after she left but when she was invited back she told kitchikewana that she was already engaged enraged kitchikewana destroyed all the decorations running to one end of beausoleil island and grabbing a large ball of earth running to the other end he tossed it into the great lakes thus the 30000 islands were created the indentations left behind by his fingers form the five bays of georgian bay: midland bay penetang bay hog bay
