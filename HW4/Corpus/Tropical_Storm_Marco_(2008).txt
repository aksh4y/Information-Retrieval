however the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet (305xc2xa0m) deep that covered highways and damaged homescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations impact and records3 see also4 references5 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaletropical storm marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern caribbean in late september 2008 on octoberxc2xa04 a tropical wave reached the same area and the system spawned a circulation center over belize development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land as the system neared the bay of campeche convection quickly developed around the low at 0000xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa06 the low was designated as tropical depression thirteen while located over laguna de txc3xa9rminos{2] a mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm's well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path{3] by 1200xc2xa0utc the small cyclone with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles (137 kilometers) across was upgraded to tropical storm marco{2]favorable conditions for development allowed marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on octoberxc2xa06 early on octoberxc2xa07 marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 998xc2xa0millibar (hpa; 2947xc2xa0inhg){2] this was based on a reconnaissance mission into marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61xc2xa0mph (98xc2xa0kmh) following the quick increase in intensity forecasters noted the possibility of marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall{4] the storm maintained a small area of deep convection averaging 92 miles (148xc2xa0km) in diameter as it continued moving towards the west-northwest{5] shortly after reaching peak intensity tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles (185xc2xa0km) from the center of marco{6] at 1200xc2xa0utc the center of marco made landfall near misantla veracruz with winds of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh){2] once inland marco rapidly weakened{7] being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall the small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of mexico{2]preparations impact and records{edit]see also: tropical cyclone warnings and watchestropical storms marco (center) norbert (bottom left) and the low that would eventually become odile (bottom) on octoberxc2xa06upon the storm's formation the government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the gulf of mexico from tuxpan to punta el lagarto{8] that afternoon the government issued a hurricane watch between cabo rojo and veracruz and extended the tropical storm warning northward to cabo rojo{9] officials closed schools ahead of the storm and opened 200 shelters{10] an estimated 3000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast{11] soldiers used school buses to transport evacuees to the shelters{10] marco formed in the area of mexico's main oil-facilities{12] leading to the evacuation of 33 workers from four platforms six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in veracruz{10] the mexican secretariat of communications and transportation also closed the ports of nautla and alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure{13]marco shortly after being upgraded to a tropical storm on octoberxc2xa06upon landfall heavy rains peaking at 79 inches (201 millimeters) in el pujal san luis potosxc3xad{14] and falling at rates up to 1xc2xa0inch per hour (254xc2xa0mmh){2] caused some flooding in coastal towns near veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground{15] the rains from marco worsened flood situations in areas of mexico already suffering from severe flooding{10] officials in veracruz in their post-storm damage survey reported that two rivers the quilate and tenoch overflowed their banks due to rains produced by marco{16] one of these rivers left the towns of minatitlan and hidalgotitlan under 10xc2xa0ft (3xc2xa0m) of water{10] highways along the coast of veracruz were also flooded{17] another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks{18] thirteen municipalities within veracruz were affected by marco in vega de alatorre 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water three landslides were also reported in misantla colipa; none of them caused damage{19] in all marco's impact was light; minimal damage was recorded and none of the estimated 400000 people affected by the storm sustained injury{2]{20]in the wake of marco the general coordination of civil protection of the ministry of the interior declared a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in veracruz{21]{22]{23] relief goods were distributed to the affected areas by octoberxc2xa09 the government of mexico reported that 4700 blankets 2900 mattresses 5554 bottles of water (each containing 500xc2xa0milliliters) 260000 boxes of milk 250000 packages of biscuits and 12400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed{24]at 0052xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa07 tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles (185xc2xa0km) from the center of marco this made marco the smallest tropical cyclone ever recorded surpassing the previous record set on decemberxc2xa024 1974 by cyclone tracy whose tropical storm-force winds extended 30 miles (48xc2xa0km){1]{2]{25]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of tropical cyclone recordstimeline of the 2008 atlantic hurricane seasontyphoon tip xe2x80x93 largest tropical cyclone on recordcyclone tracy xe2x80x93 previous record holderreferences{edit]^ a b neal dorst (may 29 2009) "subject: e5) which are the largest and smallest tropical cyclones on record?" national hurricane center archived from the original on december 22 2008 retrieved may 29 2009xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i james l franklin (november 4 2008) "tropical cyclone report: tropical storm marco" (pdf) national hurricane center retrieved january 23 2009xc2xa0^ richard j pasch;
