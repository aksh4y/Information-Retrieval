b'polar high - wikipedia polar highfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchthe polar highs are areas of high atmospheric pressure around the north and south poles; the north polar high being the stronger one because land gains and loses heat more effectively than sea the cold temperatures in the polar regions cause air to descend to create the high pressure (a process called subsidence) just as the warm temperatures around the equator cause air to rise to create the low pressure intertropical convergence zone rising air also occurs along bands of low pressure situated just below the polar highs around the 50th parallels of latitude these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin{1] this convergence of rising air completes the vertical cycle around the polar cell in each latitudinal hemisphere closely related to this concept is the polar vortexsurface temperatures under the polar highs are the coldest on earth with no month having an average temperature above freezing regions under the polar high also experience very low levels of precipitation which leads them to be known as "polar deserts"air flows outwards from the poles to create the polar easterlies in the arctic and antarctic areasreferences{edit]^ yochanan kushnir (2000) "the climate system: general circulation and climate zones" retrieved 13 march 2012xc2xa0vtecyclones and anticyclones of the world (centers of action)typesextratropicalmesocycloneanticyclonic stormpolarsubtropical cyclonesubtropical ridgethermaltropicalanticyclonespolar highsiberian highazores high (bermudanorth atlantic)north american high (canadiangreenland)south atlantic high (sthelena)north pacific high (hawaii high)south pacific highkalahari highcyclonesaleutian low (alaskafar east russia)atlantic hurricaneaustralian low (east coast)european windstormgenoa lowicelandic lowkona storm (hawaii)mediterranean tropical-like cyclonenor'easterpacific hurricanepolar vortextyphoonwake lowclimatology retrieved from ""categories: climatology navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagesxd0x91xd0xb5xd0xbbxd0xb0xd1x80xd1x83xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb0xd1x8fcatalxc3xa0xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9enorsk nynorskxe4xb8xadxe6x96x87 edit links  this page was last edited on 24 may 2017 at 06:59text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
