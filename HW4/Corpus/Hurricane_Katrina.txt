tropical cyclone that was one of the costliest natural disasters and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states{2] it also was the costliest us disaster until 2017 when hurricane harvey hit the united states gulf coast it was the eleventh named storm the fifth hurricane and the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane seasonthe storm originated over the bahamas on augustxc2xa023 from the interaction between a tropical wave and the remnants of tropical depression ten early the following day the new depression intensified into tropical storm katrina the cyclone headed generally westward toward florida and strengthened into a hurricane only two hours before making landfall at hallandale beach and aventura on augustxc2xa025 after very briefly weakening to a tropical storm katrina emerged into the gulf of mexico on augustxc2xa026 and began to rapidly deepen the storm strengthened to a category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico{3] but weakened before making its second landfall as a category 3 hurricane on august 29 in southeast louisianathe storm caused severe destruction along the gulf coast from central florida to texas much of it due to the storm surge and levee failure severe property damage occurred in coastal areas such as mississippi beachfront towns where boats and casino barges rammed buildings pushing cars and houses inland; water reached 6xe2x80x9312 miles (10xe2x80x9319xc2xa0km) from the beach the storm was the third most intense united states landfalling tropical cyclone behind the 1935 labor day hurricane and hurricane camille in 1969 overall at least 1245xc2xa0people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods making it the deadliest united states hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane total property damage was estimated at 108 billion (2005 usd){1] roughly four times the damage wrought by hurricane andrew in 1992 in the united states{4]over fifty breaches in new orleans's hurricane surge protection were the cause of the majority of the death and destruction during katrina on august 29 2005 eventually 80 of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded and the floodwaters lingered for weeks{5] according to a modeling exercise conducted by the us army corps of engineers (usace) two-thirds of the deaths in greater new orleans were due to levee and floodwall failure{6] all of the major studies concluded that the usace the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the flood control act of 1965 was responsible this is mainly due to a decision to use shorter steel sheet pilings in an effort to save money{7] in january 2008 judge stanwood duval us district court ruled that despite the corps' role in the flooding the agency{8] could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the flood control act of 1928 exactly ten years after katrina j david rogers lead author of a new report in the official journal of the world water council concluded that the flooding during katrina "could have been prevented had the corps retained an external review board to double-check its flood-wall designs"{9]{10]there was also an investigation of the responses from federal state and local governments resulting in the resignation of federal emergency management agency (fema) director michael d brown and of new orleans police department (nopd) superintendent eddie compass many other government officials were criticized for their responses especially new orleans mayor ray nagin louisiana governor kathleen blanco and president george w bush several agencies including the united states coast guard (uscg) national hurricane center (nhc) and national weather service (nws) were commended for their actions the nhc provided accurate hurricane forecasts with sufficient lead time{11]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations21 federal government211 national oceanic and

scalehurricane katrina formed as tropical depression twelve over the southeastern bahamas on august 23 2005 as the result of an interaction between a tropical wave and the remnants of tropical depression ten the storm strengthened into tropical storm katrina on the morning of august 24 the tropical storm moved towards florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between hallandale beach and aventura on the morning of august 25 the storm weakened over land but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the gulf of mexico and it continued strengthening over open waters on august 27 the storm reached category 3 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale becoming the third major hurricane of the season an eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size{1] the storm rapidly intensified after entering the gulf growing from a category 3 hurricane to a category 5 hurricane in just nine hours this rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the "unusually warm" waters of the loop current{12]katrina on august 28 nearing the gulf coastkatrina attained category 5 status on the morning of august 28 and reached its peak strength at 1800 utc that day with maximum sustained winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum central pressure of 902xc2xa0mbar (266xc2xa0inhg) the pressure measurement made katrina the fourth most intense atlantic hurricane on record at the time only to be surpassed by hurricanes rita and wilma later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the gulf of mexico at the time however this record was later broken by hurricane rita{1] the hurricane subsequently weakened and katrina made its second landfall at 1110 utc on august 29 as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) near buras-triumph louisiana at landfall hurricane-force winds extended outward 120 miles (190xc2xa0km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920xc2xa0mbar (27xc2xa0inhg) after moving over southeastern louisiana and breton sound it made its third landfall near the louisianaxe2x80x93mississippi border with 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds still at category 3 intensity{13] katrina maintained strength well into mississippi finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) inland near meridian mississippi it was downgraded to a tropical depression near clarksville tennessee but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern great lakes region on august 31 when it was absorbed by a frontal boundary the resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern canada{1]preparationsmain

around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists on august 27 it moved its personnel out of the new orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation{14] aircrews from the aviation training center in mobile staged rescue aircraft from texas to florida{15] all aircraft were returning towards the gulf of mexico by the afternoon of august 29 air crews many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane began a round-the-clock rescue effort in new orleans and along the mississippi and alabama coastlines{16]president of the united states george w bush declared a state of emergency in selected regions of louisiana alabama and mississippi on august 27{17] "on sunday august 28 president bush spoke with governor blanco to encourage her to order a mandatory evacuation of new orleans"{18] however during the testimony by former federal emergency management agency (fema) chief michael brown before a us house subcommittee on septemberxc2xa026 representative stephen buyer (r-in) inquired as to why president bush's declaration of state of emergency of august 27 had not included the coastal parishes of orleans jefferson and plaquemines{19] the declaration actually did not include any of louisiana's coastal parishes whereas the coastal counties were included in the declarations for mississippi and alabama{20]{21] brown testified that this was because louisiana governor blanco had not included those parishes in her initial request for aid a decision that he found "shocking" after the hearing blanco released a copy of her letter which showed she had requested assistance for "all the southeastern parishes including the city of new orleans" as well specifically naming 14 parishes including jefferson orleans st bernard and plaquemines{22]voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast louisiana as well as coastal mississippi and alabama about 12 million residents of the gulf coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order{1]national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa)on the afternoon of augustxc2xa026 the national hurricane center (nhc) realized that katrina had yet to make the turn toward the florida panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the mississippi coast{23] the national weather service's new orleansbaton rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin on augustxc2xa028 predicting that the area would be "uninhabitable for weeks" after "devastating damage" caused by katrina which at that time rivaled the intensity of hurricane camille{24] during video conferences involving the president later that day and on augustxc2xa029 nhc director max mayfield expressed concern that katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls in one conference he stated "i do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but that's obviously a very very great concern"{25] additionally the national hurricane center issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches throughout the duration of katrina:summary of tropical cyclone warnings and watches associated

alabama governor bob riley declared a state of emergency for the approaching hurricane katrina on the same day he requested president bush to declare "expedited major disaster declaration" for six

augustxc2xa026 in preparation for the storm's landfall additionally the state government activated its emergency operations center the next day and local governments began issuing evacuation orders by 6:00 pm cdt on august 28 11 counties and cities issued evacuation orders a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning moreover 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed{11]by sunday august 28 most infrastructure along the gulf coast had been shut down including all freight and amtrak rail traffic into the evacuation areas as well as the waterford nuclear generating station{33]louisianasee also: hurricane preparedness for new orleansvertical cross-section of new orleans showing maximum levee height of 23 feet (7xc2xa0m) vertical scale exaggeratedin louisiana the state's hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds persons in areas designated phase ii begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in phase iii areas (including new orleans) evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds{34] many private caregiving facilities that relied on bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges because they waited too long{35] louisiana's emergency operations plan supplement 1c (part ii section ii paragraph d) calls for use of school and other public buses in evacuations{36] although buses that later flooded were available to transport those dependent upon public transportation not enough bus drivers were available to drive them as governor blanco did not sign an emergency waiver to allow any licensed driver to transport evacuees on school buses{37]by august 26 the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of katrina 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) westward from the florida panhandle putting the city of new orleans directly in the center of their track probabilities; the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17 with strike probability rising to 29 by august 28{38] this scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because some parts of new orleans and the metro area are below sea level since the storm surge produced by the hurricane's right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was forecast to be 28 feet (85xc2xa0m) while the levees offered protection to 23 feet (70xc2xa0m) emergency management officials in new orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city causing major flooding{39]at a news conference at 10 am on august 28 shortly after katrina was upgraded to a category 5 storm new orleans mayor ray nagin ordered the first-ever mandatory evacuation of the city calling katrina "a storm that most of us have long feared"{40] the city government also established several "refuges of last resort" for citizens who could not leave the city including the massive louisiana superdome which sheltered approximately 26000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore{41]{42] some estimates claimed that 80 of the 13 million residents of the greater new orleans metropolitan area evacuated leaving behind substantially fewer people than remained in the city during the hurricane ivan evacuation{43]impactmain article:

katrina's storm surge caused 53 breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater new orleans area submerging 80 of the city a june 2007 report by the american society of civil engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding was caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls{47] the storm surge also devastated the coasts of mississippi and alabama making katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the united states and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the total damage from katrina is estimated at 108 billion (2005 us dollars){1]{48]the death toll from katrina is uncertain with reports differing by hundreds according to the national hurricane center 1836 fatalities can be attributed to the storm: 1 in kentucky 2 each in alabama georgia and ohio 14 in florida 238 in mississippi and 1577 in louisiana{44]{49] however 135 people remain categorized as missing in louisiana{49] and many of the deaths are indirect but it is almost impossible to determine the exact cause of some of the fatalities{1] a 2008 report by the disaster medicine and public health preparedness journal indicates that 966xc2xa0deaths can be directly attributed to the storm in louisiana including out of state evacuees and another 20 indirectly (such as firearm related deaths and gas poisoning) due to uncertain causes of death with 454xc2xa0evacuees an upper-bound of 1440 is noted in the paper{45] a follow-up study by the louisiana department of health  hospitals determined that the storm was directly responsible for 1170xc2xa0fatalities in louisiana{46]federal disaster declarations covered 90000 square miles (230000xc2xa0km2) of the united states an area almost as large as the united kingdom the hurricane left an estimated three million people without electricity on september 3 2005 homeland security secretary michael chertoff described the aftermath of hurricane katrina as "probably the worst catastrophe or set of catastrophes" in the country's history referring to the hurricane itself plus the flooding of new orleans{50]even in 2010 debris remained in some coastal communities{51]florida bahamas and cubadamage to a mobile home in davie florida following hurricane katrinamain article: effects of hurricane katrina in floridahurricane katrina first made landfall between hallandale beach and aventura florida on augustxc2xa025 the storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the miami metropolitan area with a peak total of 1643xc2xa0in (417xc2xa0mm) in perrine as a result local flooding occurred in miami-dade county damaging approximately 100xc2xa0homes farther south in the florida keys a tornado was spawned in marathon on augustxc2xa026 the tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated 5 million in damage{52] the rains caused flooding and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines leaving 145xc2xa0million people without power damage in south florida was estimated at 523 million mostly as a result of crop damage twelve deaths occurred in south florida of which three were caused by downed trees in broward county three from drowning in miami-dade county three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators one was due to a vehicle accident one occurred during debris cleanup and one was associated with a lack of electricitysignificant impact was also reported in the florida panhandle although katrina moved ashore in louisiana and mississippi its outer periphery produced a 537xc2xa0ft (164xc2xa0m) storm surge in pensacola high waves caused beach erosion and closed nearby roadways there were five tornadoes in the northwestern portion of the state though none of them caused significant damage throughout the florida panhandle the storm resulted in an estimated 100xc2xa0million in damage there were two indirect fatalities from katrina in walton county as a result of a traffic accident{1] in the florida panhandle 77000xc2xa0customers lost power{53] overall the hurricane killed 14xc2xa0people and caused at least 623xc2xa0million in damagebefore striking south florida katrina traversed the bahamas as a tropical storm however minimal impact was reported with only "fresh breezes" on various islands{54]although hurricane katrina stayed well to the north of cuba on august 29 it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) to western regions of the island telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8000xc2xa0people were evacuated in the pinar del rxc3xado province according to cuban television reports the coastal town of surgidero de batabanxc3xb3 was 90 underwater{55]louisianaflooding in venice louisianaon august 29 hurricane katrina made landfall near buras-triumph louisiana with 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) winds a strong category 3 storm however as it had only just weakened from category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large it is possible that sustained winds of category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern louisiana although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in mississippi was higher a very significant surge affected the louisiana coast the height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data although a tide gauge in plaquemines parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet (43xc2xa0m) and a 12-foot (37xc2xa0m) storm surge was recorded in grand isle hurricane katrina made final landfall near the mouth of the pearl river with the eye straddling st tammany parish louisiana and hancock county mississippi on the morning of august 29 at about 9:45m cst{1]hurricane katrina also brought heavy rain to louisiana with 8xe2x80x9310 inches (200xe2x80x93250xc2xa0mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state in the area around slidell the rainfall was even higher and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches (380xc2xa0mm) as a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of lake pontchartrain rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore affecting communities from slidell to mandeville several bridges were destroyed including the i-10 twin span bridge connecting slidell to new orleans{1] almost 900000 people in louisiana lost power as a result of hurricane katrina{56]katrina's storm surge inundated all parishes surrounding lake pontchartrain including st tammany tangipahoa st john the baptist and st charles parishes st tammany parish received a two-part storm surge the first surge came as lake pontchartrain rose and the storm blew water from the gulf of mexico into the lake the second came as the eye of katrina passed westerly winds pushed water into a bottleneck at the rigolets pass forcing it farther inland the range of surge levels in eastern st tammany parish is estimated at 13xe2x80x9316 feet (40xe2x80x9349xc2xa0m) not including wave action{57]hard-hit st bernard parish was flooded because of breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the mississippi river gulf outlet (mr-go) and the breach of the 40 arpent canal levee that was designed and built by the orleans levee board the search for the missing was undertaken by the st bernard fire department because of the assets of the united states coast guard being diverted to new orleans in the months after the storm many of the missing were tracked down by searching flooded homes tracking credit card records and visiting homes of family and relatives{58]hurricane katrina making landfall in new orleans louisianaaccording to the us dept of housing and urban development in st bernard parish 81 (20229) of the housing units were damaged in st tammany parish 70 (48792) were damaged and in placquemines parish 80 (7212) were damaged{59]in addition the combined effect of hurricanes katrina and rita was the destruction of an

that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of category 1 or category 2 strengthkatrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro new orleans and the failure of the 40 arpent canal levee nearly every levee in metro new orleans was breached as hurricane katrina passed just east of the city limits failures occurred in new orleans and surrounding communities especially st bernard parish the mississippi river gulf outlet (mr-go) breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of east new orleans most of st bernard parish and the east bank of plaquemines parish the major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th street canal levee the london avenue canal and the wide navigable industrial canal which left approximately 80 of the city flooded{61]most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged the only routes out of the city were the westbound crescent city connection and the huey p long bridge as large portions of the i-10 twin span bridge traveling eastbound towards slidell louisiana had collapsed both the lake pontchartrain causeway and the crescent city connection only carried emergency traffic{62]on august 29 at 7:40 am cdt it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the hyatt regency new orleans had been blown out and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage{63] the hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city with beds reported to be flying out of the windows insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off{64]the superdome which was sheltering many people who had not evacuated sustained significant damage{65] two sections of the superdome's roof were

reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on september 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early october{66]levee breaches in new orleans also caused a significant number of deaths with over 700 bodies recovered in new orleans by october 23 2005{67] some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections especially in the east of the city the advanced state of decomposition of many corpses some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead{68]a us coast guardsman searches for survivors in new orleans in the katrina aftermaththe first deaths reported from the city were

brief initial landfall in louisiana katrina had made its final landfall near the state line and the eyewall passed over the cities of bay st louis and waveland as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh){1] katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central mississippi coast causing a powerful 27-foot (82xc2xa0m) storm surge which penetrated 6

repairs and reconstruction in the region{90] which did not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply destruction of the gulf coast's highway infrastructure and exports of commodities such as grain katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries;{48] the total shut-in oil production from the gulf of mexico in the six-month period following katrina was approximately 24 of the annual production and the shut-in gas production for the same period was about 18{91] the forestry industry in mississippi was also affected as 13xc2xa0million acres (5300xc2xa0km2) of forest lands were destroyed{92] the total loss to the forestry industry from katrina is calculated to rise to about 5 billion{92] furthermore hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed before the hurricane the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs with 600000 of them in new orleans it is estimated that the total economic impact in louisiana and mississippi may eventually exceed 150 billion{93] forensic accountants were involved in the assessment of economic damages resulting from this catastrophe{94]katrina displaced over one million people from the central gulf coast to elsewhere across the united states becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the united states{95] houston texas had an increase of 35000 people; mobile alabama gained over 24000; baton rouge louisiana over 15000; and hammond louisiana received over 10000 nearly doubling its size chicago illinois received

erosion in some cases completely devastating coastal areas in dauphin island (a barrier island) approximately 90xc2xa0mi (140xc2xa0km) to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall the sand that comprised the island was transported across the island into the mississippi sound pushing the island towards land{101] the storm surge and waves from katrina also severely damaged the chandeleur islands which had been affected by hurricane ivan the previous year{102] the us geological survey has estimated 217xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi (560xc2xa0km2) of land was transformed to water by the hurricanes katrina and rita{103] before the storm subsidence and erosion caused loss of land in the louisiana wetlands and bayous this along with the canals built in the area let katrina keep more of its intensity when it struck{104] the lands that were lost were breeding grounds for marine mammals brown pelicans turtles and fish and migratory species such as redhead ducks{92] overall about 20 of the local marshes were permanently overrun by water as a result of the storm{92]the damage from katrina forced the closure of 16 national wildlife refuges breton national wildlife refuge lost half its area in the storm{105] as a result the hurricane affected the habitats of sea turtles mississippi sandhill cranes red-cockaded woodpeckers and alabama beach mice{105]katrina also produced massive tree loss along the gulf coast particularly in louisiana'a pearl river basin and among bottomland hardwood forests before the storm the standard mortality rate for the area's trees was 19 but this interval increased to 205 by the end of 2006{106] delayed mortality as an effect of the storm continued with rates up to 5 until 2011{107] this significant loss in biomass caused greater decay and an increase in carbon emissions for example by 2006 the decreased biomass in bottomland hardwood forests contributed an amount of carbon which equated to roughly 140 of the net annual us carbon sink in forest trees{108]the chandeleur islands before katrina (left) and after (right) showing the impact of the storm along coastal areasthe storm caused oil spills from 44 facilities throughout southeastern louisiana which resulted in over 7xc2xa0million us gallons (26000xc2xa0m3) of oil being leaked some spills were only a few hundred gallons and most were contained on-site though some oil entered the ecosystem and residential areas after a spill at the murphy oil refinery for example 1800xc2xa0homes were oiled in the towns of chalmette and meraux{100] unlike hurricane ivan no offshore oil spills were officially reported after hurricane katrina however skytruth reported some signs of surface oil in the gulf of mexico{100]finally as part of the cleanup effort the flood waters that covered new orleans were pumped into lake pontchartrain a process that took 43 days to complete{48] these residual waters contained a mix of raw sewage bacteria heavy metals pesticides toxic chemicals and oil

not available to them through any other means as well as non-essential items{109] additionally there were reports of carjacking murders thefts and rapes in new orleans some sources later determined that many of the reports were inaccurate greatly exaggerated or completely false leading news agencies to print retractions{110]thousands of national guard and federal troops were mobilized and sent to louisiana with 7841 in the area on august 29 to a maximum of 46838 on september 10 a number of local law enforcement agents from across the country were temporarily deputized by the state "they

shooting going on there was sniping going on over the first week of september law and order were gradually restored to the city"{112] several shootings occurred between police and new orleans residents some involving police misconduct; including an incident that killed two unarmed civilians and seriously injured other others at danziger bridge{113] five former police officers pleaded guilty to charges connected to the danziger bridge shootings in the aftermath of the hurricane six other former or current officers appeared in court in june 2011{114]overall a number of arrests were made throughout the affected area including some near the new orleans convention center a temporary jail was constructed of chain link cages in the new orleans union passenger terminal the city's main train station{115]in west virginia where roughly 350 refugees were located local officials took fingerprints to run criminal background checks on the refugees the background checks found that 45 of the refugees had a criminal record of some nature and that 22 had a violent criminal record{116] media speculation fueled a popular perception that the displaced new orleans residents brought a wave of crime into the communities where they relocated however detailed studies of crime statistics in these communities did not reveal a significant increase in violent crime{117]{118]{119]government

and secretary of health and human services mike leavitt during a press conference from the rose garden regarding the devastation along the gulf coast caused by katrinawithin the united states and as delineated in the national response plan disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility when local government exhausts its resources it then requests specific additional resources from the county level the request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels{120]some disaster recovery response to katrina began before the storm with federal emergency management agency (fema) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks a network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from new orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall (even though many were directed to not enter the area) and continued for more than six months after the storm{120]of the 60000 people stranded in new orleans the coast guard rescued more than 33500{121] congress recognized the coast guard's response with an official entry in the congressional record{122] and the armed service was awarded the presidential unit citation{123]the united states northern command established joint task force (jtf) katrina based out of camp shelby mississippi to act as the military's on-scene response on sunday august 28 with us army lieutenant general russel l honorxc3xa9 as commander{124] approximately 58000 national guard personnel were activated to deal with the storm's aftermath with troops coming from all 50 states{125] the department of defense also activated volunteer members of the civil air patrolmichael chertoff secretary of the department of homeland security decided to take over the federal state and local operations officially on august 30 2005 citing the national response plan{126] this was refused by governor blanco who indicated that her national guard could manage early in september congress authorized a total of 623 billion in aid for victims{127] additionally president bush enlisted the help of former presidents bill clinton and george h w bush to raise additional voluntary contributions much as they did after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami{128] american flags were also ordered to be half-staff from september 2 2005 to september 20 2005 in honor of the victims{129]fema provided housing assistance (rental assistance trailers etc) to more than 700000 applicantsxe2x80x94families and individuals however only one-fifth of the trailers requested in orleans parish were supplied resulting in an enormous housing shortage in the city of new orleans{130] many local areas voted to not allow the trailers and many areas had no utilities a requirement prior to placing the trailers to provide for additional housing fema has also paid for the hotel costs of 12000 individuals and families displaced by katrina through february 7 2006 when a final deadline was set for the end of hotel cost coverage after this deadline evacuees were still eligible to receive federal assistance which could be used towards either apartment rent additional hotel stays or fixing their ruined homes although fema no longer paid for hotels directly{131] as of march 30 2010 there were still 260 families living in fema-provided trailers in louisiana and mississippi{132]law enforcement and public safety agencies from across the united states provided a "mutual aid" response to louisiana and new orleans in the weeks following the disaster many agencies responded with manpower and equipment from as far away as california michigan nevada new york and texas this response was welcomed by local louisiana authorities as their staff were either becoming fatigued stretched too thin or even quitting from the job{133]two weeks after the storm more than half of the states were involved in providing shelter for evacuees by four weeks after the storm evacuees had been registered in all 50 states and in 18700 zip codesxe2x80x94half of the nation's residential postal zones most evacuees had stayed within 250 miles (400xc2xa0km) but 240000 households went to houston and other cities over 250 miles (400xc2xa0km) away and another 60000 households went over 750 miles (1200xc2xa0km) away{134]criticism of government responsemain article: criticism of government response to hurricane katrinausns comfort takes on supplies at mayport florida en route to the gulf coastthe criticisms of the government's response to hurricane katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath more specifically the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of new orleans and the subsequent state of chaos in the city{72] the neologism katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy and was a runner-up for "2005 word of the year"{135]within days of katrina's august 29 landfall public debate arose about the local state and federal governments' role in the preparations for and response to the hurricane criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without water food or shelter deaths from thirst exhaustion and violence days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the louisiana superdome and the new orleans civic center some alleged that race class and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response for example during a concert for hurricane relief a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane rapper kanye west veered off script and harshly criticized the government's response to the crisis stating that "george bush doesn't care about black people"{136]in accordance with federal law president george w bush directed the secretary of the department of homeland security michael chertoff to coordinate the federal response chertoff designated michael d brown head of the federal emergency management agency as the principal federal official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the gulf coast region however the president and secretary chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination brown claimed that governor blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful governor blanco and her staff disputed this{137] eight days later brown was recalled to washington and coast guard vice admiral thad w allen replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations{138] three days after the recall michael d brown resigned as director of fema in spite of having received recent praise from president bush{139]politicians activists pundits and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by mayor nagin of new orleans and louisiana governor blanco nagin and blanco were criticized for failing to implement new orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food water security or sanitary conditions perhaps the most important criticism of nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city{11]the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina raised other more general public policy issues about emergency management environmental policy poverty and unemployment the discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected elections and legislation enacted at various levels of government the storm's devastation also prompted a congressional investigation which found that fema and the red cross "did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of gulf coast victims" additionally it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government{11] an abc news poll conducted on september 2 2005 showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75) than at the federal government (67) with 44 blaming bush's leadership directly{140] a later cnnusatodaygallup poll showed that respondents disagreed widely on who was to blame for the problems in the city following the hurricane xe2x80x94 13 said bush 18 said federal agencies 25 blamed state or local officials and 38 said no one was to blame{141] a 2013 pool of louisiana republicans found more (29) blamed barack obama for the poor federal response to the hurricane than george w bush (28) despite the fact that bush was actually president during the storm and obama merely a junior senator{142]{143]international responsemain article: international

sandwiches snacks and drinks served in and around new orleans its satern network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25000 survivors salvation army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277000 individuals as part of the overall effort salvation army officers employees and volunteers contributed more than 900000 hours of service{167]analysis of new orleans levee failuresmain article: 2005 levee failures in greater new orleansview of the eyewall of hurricane katrina taken on august 28 2005 as seen from a noaa wp-3d hurricane hunter aircraft before the storm made landfall on the united states gulf coaston april 5 2006 months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general carl strock chief of engineers and commander of the corps of engineers testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that "we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure"{168]a june 2007 report released by the american society of civil engineers determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in new orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws{47] the us army corps of engineers is federally mandated in the flood control act of 1965 with responsibility for the conception design and construction of the region's flood-control system according to report published in august 2015 in the official journal of the world water council the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet (5xc2xa0m) instead of between 31 and 46 feet (9 and 14xc2xa0m) that decision saved approximately us100 million but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability{169]other factors may have contributed to the flooding according to the authors of catastrophe in the making (island press 2009) the straight design and lack of outward flow into the gulf allowed the mississippi river-gulf outlet canal to become "the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion" which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected new orleans from storm surge{170] the army corps of engineers built and maintained the canal furthermore according to storm surge researcher hassan mashriqui:"storm surge pushing across shallow lake borgne from the east is constrained by these mrgo levees to the south and to the north by the long-standing levees of the intracoastal waterway (giww) initially ten or more miles apart these two channels meet and when they do the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel xe2x80x93 the funnel xe2x80x93 only 260 yards wide constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet highxe2x80xa6in concert with the denuded marshes it could increase the local storm surge hitting the intracoastal waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent xe2x80x93 a critical and fundamental flaw"{171]the corps of engineers disputes these causalities{172] nonetheless in june 2008 the army corps of engineers new orleans district submitted a deep-draft de-authorization study of the mrgo which stated that "an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel" congress ordered the mrgo closed as a direct resultmany of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of katrina in reconstructing them precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety for example in every situation possible the corps of engineers replaced i-walls with t-walls t-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls{173]however there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements in february 2008 the bush administration requested that the state of louisiana pay about 15 billion of an estimated 72 billion for corps of engineers levee work (in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by congress as early as the flood control act of 1928) a proposal which angered many louisiana leaders{174]on may 2 2008 louisiana gov bobby jindal used a speech to the national press club to request that president bush free up money to complete work on louisiana's levees bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill which would pass sooner{175]media involvementmain article: media coverage of hurricane katrinamany representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of hurricane katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events instead of simply reporting because of the loss of most means of communication such as land-based and cellular telephone systems field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities the authorities who monitored local and network news broadcasts as well as internet sites would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports one illustration was when geraldo rivera of fox news tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the ernest n morial convention center{176] the role of am radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims immediately after katrina wwl-am was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air this emergency service simulcasted on shortwave outlet whri was named "the united radio broadcasters of new orleans" their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500xc2xa0mi (800xc2xa0km) away announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios{177] the cellular phone antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several monthsthe storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of internet sitesxe2x80x94especially blogging and community journalism one example was the effort of nolacom the web affiliate of new orleans' times-picayune a group of reporters were awarded the breaking news pulitzer prize{178] and shared the public service pulitzer with the biloxi-based sun herald{179] the newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on nola's blogs as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on august 30 the site became an international focal point for news by local media and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums nola was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teamsxe2x80x94from individuals to the coast guardxe2x80x94which used information in rescue efforts much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the sms functions of their cell phones to friends and relatives outside the area who then relayed the information back to nolacom the aggregation of community journalism user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention and was called a watershed moment in journalism{180] in the wake of these online-only efforts the pulitzer committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries{181]as the us military and rescue services regained control over the city there were restrictions on the activity of the media on september 9 the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have "zero access" to efforts to recover bodies in new orleans immediately following this announcement cnn filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order against the ban the next day the government backed down and reversed the ban{182]retirementsee also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the large death toll and destruction of property along the gulf coast the name katrina was officially retired on april 6 2006 by the world meteorological organization at the request of the us government the name will never again be used for another north atlantic hurricane it was replaced by katia on list iii of the atlantic hurricane naming lists which was used in the 2011 atlantic hurricane season{183]studies concerning post-katrina victimsan article published in the community mental health journal from january 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of hurricane katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in dallas texas more than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (mdd) about one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident mdd and ptsd{184]in a study published in maternal and child health journal five-to seven years after the disaster 308 new orleans pregnant women were interviewed about their exposure to katrina researchers found that there were associations between experiencing damage during katrina and birthweight thus researchers concluded that natural disasters may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes furthermore it was concluded that women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be more vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome{185]from a september 2015 journal of current psychology a study examined the attitudes of older long-term residents of baton rouge louisiana toward displaced newcomers to their community after using multiple tests analyses and descriptive statistics the study suggested residents grew to become more patient tolerant and friendly towards newcomers the study also suggests however that residents felt more fearful and suspicious of the evacuees as well as the fact that they were being taken advantage of more{186]reconstructionmain article: reconstruction of new orleansvolunteers from americorps in new orleans january 2006reconstruction of each section of the southern portion of louisiana has been addressed in the army corps lacpr (louisiana coastal protection and restoration) final technical report which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated{187]the technical report includes:locations
