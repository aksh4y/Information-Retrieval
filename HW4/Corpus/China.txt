is being considered for deletionxc2xa0xe2x80xbayou may need rendering support to display the chinese text in this article correctlythe english word "china" is first attested in richard eden's 1555 translation{k] of a 1516 journal by portuguese explorer duarte barbosa{l]{31] the portuguese word was derived from persian chxc4xabnxc4xab (xdax86xdbx8cxd9x86) and some traced it further to sanskrit cxc4xabna (xe0xa4x9axe0xa5x80xe0xa4xa8){32] the earliest known example of cxc4xabna being used to refer to china dates from ad 150{33] although indian writers may not have been aware of china's existence prior to the first century bc{34] the word cxc4xabna appears in mahxc4x81bhxc4x81rata as well as in the laws of manu{35] in 1655 martino martini suggested that the word china is derived from the name of the qin dynasty (221xe2x80x93206 bc){36] a proposal supported by many later scholars{37]{38]{39] although there are also a number of alternative suggestions{35]{40]the official name of the modern state is the "people's republic of china" (chinese: xe4xb8xadxe5x8dx8exe4xbaxbaxe6xb0x91xe5x85xb1xe5x92x8cxe5x9bxbd; pinyin: zhxc5x8dnghuxc3xa1 rxc3xa9nmxc3xadn gxc3xb2nghxc3xa9guxc3xb3) the shorter form is "china" zhxc5x8dngguxc3xb3 (xe4xb8xadxe5x9bxbd) from zhxc5x8dng ("central" or "middle") and guxc3xb3 ("state nation-state"){26]{m] a term which developed under the zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne{n] it was then applied to the area around luoyi (present-day luoyang) during the eastern zhou and then to china's central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the qing{42] it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia tribes from perceived "barbarians"{42] and was the source of the english name "middle kingdom"{44]{45] a more literary or inclusive name alluding to the "land of chinese civilization" is zhxc5x8dnghuxc3xa1 (xe4xb8xadxe5x8dx8e){46] it developed during the wei and jin dynasties as a contraction of "the central state of the huaxia"{42] before the prc's establishment the proposed name of the country was the people's democratic republic of china (simplified chinese:

early hominids inhabited china between 224 million and 250000 years ago{50] the hominid fossils of peking man a homo erectus who used fire{51] were discovered in a cave at zhoukoudian near beijing; they have been dated to between 680000 and 780000 years ago{52] the fossilized teeth of homo sapiens (dated to 125000xe2x80x9380000 years ago) have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county hunan{53] chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around 7000xc2xa0bce{54] damaidi around 6000xc2xa0bce{55] dadiwan from 5800xe2x80x935400xc2xa0bce and banpo dating from the 5th millenniumxc2xa0bce some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols (7th millenniumxc2xa0bce) constituted the earliest chinese writing system{54]early dynastic rulefurther information: dynasties in chinese historyyinxu the ruins of the capital of the late shang dynasty (14th centuryxc2xa0bce)according to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100xc2xa0bce{56] the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959{57] it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period{58] the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records{59] the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th centuryxc2xa0bce{60] their oracle bone script (from cxe2x80x891500xc2xa0bce){61]{62] represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found{63] and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese characters{64]the shang were conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuriesxc2xa0bce though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king by the time of the warring states period of the 5thxe2x80x933rd centuriesxc2xa0bce there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now china each with its own king ministry and armyimperial chinachina's first emperor qin shi huang is famed for having united the warring states' walls to form the great wall of china most of the present structure however dates to the ming dynastythe terracotta army (cxe2x80x89210xc2xa0bce) discovered outside the mausoleum of the first qin emperor now xi'anthe warring states period ended in 221xc2xa0bce after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified chinese state king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor (chinese: xe5xa7x8bxe7x9ax87xe5xb8x9d; pinyin: shxc7x90 huxc3xa1ngdxc3xac) of the qin dynasty he enacted qin's legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths (ie cart axles' length) and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam{65] the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperor's death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion{66]{67]following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned{o] the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206xc2xa0bce and cexc2xa0220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese{66]{67] the han expanded the empire's territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world{69] despite the han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors{70]after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed{71] whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor; the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581 the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with korea provoked widespread unrest{72]{73]a detail from along the river during the qingming festival a 12th-century painting showing everyday life in the song dynasty's capital bianjing (present-day kaifeng)under the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age{74] the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk road{75] and made the capital chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the 8th century{76] in 907 the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade{77] between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang{78] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity{79]{80] however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty in 1127 emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jinxe2x80x93song wars the remnants of the song retreated to southern china{81]the 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271 the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty; the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279 before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300{82] a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that zheng he led treasure voyages throughout the world reaching as far as africa{83]in the early years of the ming dynasty china's capital was moved from nanjing to beijing with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo-confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations{84] the scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea (1592xe2x80x9398) and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury{85]in 1644 beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew li's short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynastyend of dynastic rulea 19th-century depiction of the taiping rebellion (1850xe2x80x931864)the qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty
