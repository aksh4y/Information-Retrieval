external linksetymology{edit]the term "hampton roads" is a centuries-old designation that originated when the region was a struggling english outpost nearly four hundred years agothe word "hampton" honors one of the founders of the virginia company of london and a great supporter of the colonization of virginia henry wriothesley 3rd earl of southampton the early administrative center of the new colony was known as elizabeth cittie named for princess elizabeth the daughter of king james i and formally designated by the virginia company in 1619 the town at the center of elizabeth cittie became known as "hampton" and a nearby waterway was designated hampton creek (also known as hampton river)other references to the earl include the area to the north across the bay (in what is now the eastern shore) which became known as northampton and an area south of the james river which became southampton as with hampton both of these names remain in use todaythe term "roads" (short for roadstead) indicates the safety of a port; as applied to a body of water it is "a partly sheltered area of water near a shore in which vessels may ride at anchor"{8] examples of other roadsteads are castle roads in another of the virginia company's settlements bermuda and lahaina roads in hawaiiin 1755 the virginia general assembly recorded the name "hampton roads" as the channel linking the james elizabeth and nansemond rivers with the chesapeake bay{1]hampton roads has become known as the world's largest natural harbor{citation needed] in part because it is the northernmost major east coast port of the united states which is ice-free year round (this status is claimed with the notable exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917 which was the entire us's coldest year on record)over time the entire region has come to be known as "hampton roads" a label more specific than its other moniker "tidewater virginia" which could by implication include other areas of tidal land in eastern virginia the us postal service changed the area's postmark from "tidewater virginia" to "hampton roads virginia" beginning in 1983{1]definitions{edit]counties and independent cities{edit]the us census bureau

official state map of pre-civil war virginia circa 1858 image from the library of virginia17thxe2x80x9319th centuries{edit]the first colonists arrived in 1607 when english captain christopher newport landed at cape henry today's city of virginia beach an event now called the "first landing" however his party moved on in search of a more defensible area upriver mindful of competitors such as the spanish who had built a failed settlement on the virginia peninsula known as the ajacxc3xa1n missionafter exploring the james river they established the first successful english colony in the new world on jamestown island on may 14 1607{19] but the low marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died before a new governor lord de la warr (delaware) arrived with john rolfe who would establish the virginia tobacco industry{19]the harbor and rivers of hampton roads were immediately recognised as prime locations for commerce shipbuilding and military installations with the fortifications at old point comfort established as early as 1610 and gosport navy yard (later norfolk naval shipyard) in 1767 the decisive battle of the revolution was won at yorktown in 1781 and the first naval action of the war of 1812 took place in hampton roads when a royal naval vessel was seized by the american privateer dash later the entrance from chesapeake bay was equipped with new fortifications (fort monroe and fort wool) much of the building work being supervised by a young military engineer robert e leeduring the american civil war (1861xe2x80x931865) the historic battle of hampton roads between the first american ironclad warships the ussxc2xa0monitor and the css virginia took place off sewell's point in 1862 the battle was inconclusive but union forces later took control of hampton roads norfolk and the lower james river though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream by a strong confederate battery at drewry's bluff also in 1862 fort monroe was the launching place for union general george mcclellan's massive advance up the virginia peninsula which almost reached the confederate capital richmond before the seven days battles forced him back in 1865 as the confederacy was near collapse president abraham lincoln met with three senior confederates at hampton roads in an unsuccessful bid for a negotiated peace{20]some former slaves had been camped near fort monroe where they were declared to be contraband of war instead of being returned to their former owners booker t washington was among the freedmen who attended the local school which evolved into the present-day hampton university20th century{edit]the jamestown exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of jamestown was held at sewell's point in a rural section of norfolk county in 1907president theodore roosevelt arrived by water in the harbor of hampton roads as did other notable persons such as mark twain and henry huttleston rogers who both arrived aboard the latter's steam yacht kanawha a major naval display was featured and the us great white fleet made an appearance the leaders of the us navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions as was later provedbeginning in 1917 as the united states became involved in world war i under president woodrow wilson formerly rural sewell's point became the site of what grew to become the largest naval base in the world which was established by the united states navy and is now known as the naval station norfolktwice in the 20th century inhabitants mostly african american were displaced when land along the northern side of the peninsula primarily in york county west of yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during world war i and world war ii creating the present-day us naval weapons station yorktown which includes cheatham annex and a former seabee base which became camp pearycommunities including "the reservation" halstead's point penniman bigler's mill and magruder were all lost and absorbed into the large military basesalthough some left the area entirely many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to grove an unincorporated town in southeastern james city county where many generations of some of those families now reside from a population estimated at only 37 in 1895 grove had grown to an estimated 1100 families by the end of the 20th century (to its north grove actually borders the naval weapons station property and on its extreme east a portion of the us army's land at fort eustis extends across skiffe's creek although there is no direct access to either base)colonial williamsburg{edit]main article: colonial williamsburgit was the dream of an episcopal priest to save his 18th-century church building by turning williamsburg into the world's largest living museum wlliamsburg replaced jamestown at the very end of the 17th century after a disastrous fire it was the capital of the colony and the new state of virginia from 1699 to 1780 the capital was moved to richmond in 1780 williamsburg became a "sleepy" small town during the civil war the battle of williamsburg was fought nearby during the peninsula campaign in the spring months of 1862 the decaying town was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881 perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as middle plantation williamsburg missed growth and economic expansion in the 19th century the main economic engines were the college of william  mary and eastern state hospital the college of william and mary was chartered by the crown and is the only pre-independence college to have kept it in addition to the city's historic past quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century the reverend dr war goodwin of bruton parish church motive was to only to save historic church building which was secured by 1907 he subsequently served in rochester new york for many years upon returning to williamsburg in 1923 he realized that many of the other colonial-era buildings were deteriorating and their existence was at riskgoodwin dreamt of a much larger restoration of the colonial town a cleric of modest means he first sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests before receiving major financial support from standard oil heir and philanthropist john d rockefeller jr and his wife abby aldrich rockefeller the result is the creation of colonial williamsburg with extensive restoration of buildings such as the wren building of the college of william  mary and the governor's palace and the transformation of downtown williamsburg area into historic district of restored buildings many 19th century buildings were removedby the 1930s colonial williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the historic triangle of colonial virginia these were of course jamestown where the colony started williamsburg and yorktown where independence from great britain was won the three points were joined by the us national park service's colonial parkway a remarkable accomplishment in course of 27 years the historic triangle area of the hampton roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in the entire worldin dr goodwin's words: "williamsburg is jamestown continued and yorktown is williamsburg vindicated"see also: historic triangleother notable hampton roads "firsts"{edit]america's first free public schools the syms and eaton free schools (later combined as syms-eaton academy) were established in hampton in 1634 and 1659 respectively the syms-eaton academy was later renamed hampton academy and in 1852 became part of the public school system thus hampton high school lays claim to being the oldest public school in the united states{21] the trust fund created from the syms and eaton donations has remained intact since the 17th century and was incorporated into support for the hampton public school system{22]in 1957 the hampton roads bridgexe2x80x93tunnel was the first bridgexe2x80x93tunnel complex in the world to be

smaller regions: the eastern portion of the virginia peninsula (the peninsula) and south hampton roads (locally known as "the southside") which are separated by the harbor when speaking of communities of hampton roads virtually all sources (including the three discussed in the following paragraphs) include the seven major cities two smaller ones and three counties within those two subregionsin addition the middle peninsula counties of gloucester and mathews while not part of the geographical hampton roads area are included in the vast metropolitan region's population also a small portion of

article: transportation in hampton roadsferry between norfolk and portsmouthhistorically from the earliest times the harbor was the key to the hampton roads area's growth both on land and in water-related activities and events ironically the harbor and its tributary waterways were (and still are) both important transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and travel yet the community leaders learned to overcome themin modern times the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized with additional traffic needs in the 21st century the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the area's leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges both for additional capacity and as the existing infrastructure much of it originally built with toll revenues has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements the now-closed kings highway bridge in suffolk and the jordan bridge closed by neighboring chesapeake in 2008 were each built in the 1920s these were considered locally prime examples of this situation{33]{34]in 2007 the new hampton roads transportation authority (hrta) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation projects including a long-sought and costly additional crossing of the harbor of hampton roads (the hampton roads bridge tunnel monitor-merrimac bridge tunnel and the james river bridge are the existing crossings) as of march 2008

a non-profit organization representing 17 localities (ten cities six counties and one town) all local universities and major military commands as well as leading businesses in southeastern virginia commenced a campaign aimed at branding the land area of hampton roads as "america's first region"the new title is based on events in 1607 when english captain christopher newport's three ships xe2x80x93 the susan constant godspeed and discovery landed at cape henry along the atlantic coast in what is today virginia beach after 18 days of exploring the area the ships and their crews arrived at jamestown island where they established the first english speaking settlement to survive in the new world on may 14 1607because the region's east-west boundaries (now the city of virginia beach and james city county) have not changed since 1607 the partnership felt justified in labeling hampton roads "america's first region" it unveiled the new brand before 800 people at the annual meeting of

williamsburg and yorktown with many restored attractions linked by the colonial parkwaythe national park service's colonial parkway joins the three popular attractions of colonial virginia with a scenic and bucolic roadway carefully shielded from views of commercial development this helps visitors mentally return to the past and there are often views of wildlife and waterfowl this two lane roadway is the best (but not quickest) way to move between the three points near the james river and york river ends of the parkway there are several pull-offs where some families allow their children to feed bread to the seagulls commercial vehicles except for tour buses are prohibitedfor an even better experience approach the area from the south by water from surry county with a ride aboard one

(established 1693) it was soon renamed to williamsburg but became a largely forgotten little town after the capital was moved to richmond in 1780 largely due to the 20th-century preservation efforts
