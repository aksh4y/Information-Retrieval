the brahmaputra delta{1] the sunderbans delta or the bengal delta{2]) is a river delta in the bengal region of the south asia consisting of bangladesh and the indian state of west bengal it is the world's largest delta and empties into the bay of bengal it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world thus earning the nickname the green delta the delta stretches from the hooghly river on the west to the meghna river on the east it is approximately 354xc2xa0km (220xc2xa0mi) across at the bay of bengal{1] kolkata in india and mongla in bangladesh are the principal seaports of the deltaa number of large rivers flow through the brahmaputra delta including the padma (main distributary of the ganges) and the jamuna (main distributary of the brahmaputra) which merge and then join the meghna before entering the seacontents1 geography2 population3 wildlife4 geology5 economy6 climate61 cyclones and flooding7 future of the delta8 view9 see also10 notes11 references12 external

is considered to be an "arcuate" delta (arc-shaped) it covers more than 105000xc2xa0km2 (41000xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) and although the delta lies mostly in bangladesh and india rivers from bhutan tibet india and nepal drain into it from the north approximately 60 of the delta is in bangladesh and 40 in west bengal india most of the delta is composed of alluvial soils made up by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slow down in the estuary rivers carry these fine particles with them even from their sources at glaciers as fluvio-glacial red and red-yellow laterite soils are found as one heads farther east the soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients which is good for agricultureit is composed of a labyrinth of channels swamps lakes and flood plain sediments (chars) the gorai-madhumati river one of the distributaries of the ganges divides the ganges delta into two parts: the geologically young active eastern delta and the older less active western delta{2]population{edit]between 125 and 143 million people live on the delta{citation needed] despite risks from floods caused by monsoons heavy runoff from the melting snows of the himalayas and north indian ocean tropical cyclones a large part of the nation of bangladesh lies in the ganges delta and many of the country's people depend on the delta for survival{3]it is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the ganges delta and approximately 400xc2xa0million people live in the ganges river basin making it the most populous river basin in the world most of the ganges delta has a population density of more than 200 people per km2 (520 people per square mile){citation needed] making it one of the most densely populated regions in the worldwildlife{edit]this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (february 2013)

although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain thick stands of tall grass known as canebrakes grow in wetter areas the sundarbans freshwater swamp forests ecoregion lies closer to the bay of bengal; this ecoregion is flooded with slightly brackish water during the dry season and fresh water during the monsoon season these forests too have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture with only 130 square kilometres (50xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) of the ecoregion's 14600 square kilometres (5600xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) protected where the delta meets the bay of bengal sundarbans mangroves form the world's largest mangrove ecoregion covering an area of 20400 square kilometres (7900xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) in a chain of 54 islands they derive their name from the predominant mangrove species heritiera fomes which are known locally as sundri or sundarianimals in the delta include the indian python (python molurus) clouded leopard (neofelis nebulosa) indian elephant (elephas maximus indicus) and crocodiles which live in the sundarbans approximately 1020 endangered bengal tigers (panthera tigris tigris) are believed to inhabit the sundarbans the gangesxe2x80x93brahmaputra basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber: sal teak and peepal trees are found in these areas the delta region has mangrove treesit is estimated that 30000 chital (axis axis) are in the sundarbans part of the delta birds found in the delta include kingfishers eagles woodpeckers the shalik (acridotheres tristis) the swamp francolin (francolinus gularis) and the doel (copsychus saularis) two species of dolphin can be found in the delta: the irrawaddy dolphin (orcaella brevirostris) and the ganges river dolphin (platanista gangetica gangetica) the irrawaddy dolphin is an oceanic dolphin which enters the delta from the bay of bengal the ganges river dolphin is a true river dolphin but is extremely rare and considered endangeredtrees found in the delta include sundari garjan (rhizophora spp) bamboo mangrove palm (nypa fruticans) and mangrove date palm (phoenix paludosa) many endangered species live heregeology{edit]the ganges delta lies at the junction of three tectonic plates: the indian plate the eurasian plate and the burma plate{4] the edge of the eocene paleoshelf runs approximately from kolkata to the edge of the shillong plateau the edge of the paleoshelf marks the transition from the thick continental crust in the northwest to the thin continental or oceanic crust in the southeast the enormous sediment supply from the himalayan collision has extended the delta about 400 kilometres (250xc2xa0mi) seaward since the eocene the sediment thickness southeast of the edge of the paleoshelf beneath the ganges delta can exceed 16xc2xa0km (10 miles){5]economy{edit]rice cattle and fishing in rivers and ponds are important sources of foodapproximately two-thirds of the bangladesh people work in agriculture and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta the major crops that are grown in the ganges delta are jute tea and rice{3] fishing is also an important activity in the delta region with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area{6]in recent years scientists have been helping the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods by turning unused ponds into viable fish farms and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish using new systems fish production in existing ponds has increased 800{7] shrimp are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water most are exported{6]a lot of bustle at a ferry pierthe vidyasagar setu which spans the hoogli river in kolkataas there is a maze of many river branches the area is difficult to pass most islands are only connected with the mainland by simple wooden ferryboats bridges are rare some islands are not yet connected to the electric grid so island residents tend to use solar cells for a bit of electric supplyclimate{edit]the ganges delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone and receives between 1500 to 2000xc2xa0mm (59 to 79xc2xa0in) of rainfall each year in the western part and 2000 to 3000xc2xa0mm (79 to 118xc2xa0in) in the eastern part{citation needed] hot dry summers and cool dry winters make the climate suitable for agriculturecyclones and flooding{edit]in november 1970 the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the ganges delta region the 1970 bhola cyclone killed 500000 people (official death toll) with another 100000 missing the guinness book of world records estimated the total loss of human life from the bhola cyclone at 1000000{8]another cyclone hit the delta in 1991 killing about 139000 people{9]people have to be careful on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs in 1998 the ganges flooded the delta killing about 1000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless the bangladesh government asked for 900xc2xa0million to help feed the people of the region as the entire rice crop was lost{10]future of the delta{edit]one of the greatest challenges people living on the ganges delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused by climate change an increase in sea level of 05 metres (1xc2xa0ft 8xc2xa0in) could result in six million people losing their homes in bangladesh{11]important gas reserves have been discovered in the delta such as in the titas and bakhrabad gas fields several major oil companies have invested in exploration of the ganges delta region{12]{13]view{edit]brahmaputra river from spacesee also{edit]bengal fannotes{edit]^ a b merriam-webster 1997 pxc2xa0412^ a b chowdhury sifatul quader;
