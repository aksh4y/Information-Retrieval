legislature in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a "university of the territory of wisconsin" and a high-ranking board of visitors was appointed however this body (the predecessor of the uw board of regents) never actually accomplished anything before wisconsin was incorporated as a state in 1848{13] the wisconsin constitution provided for "the establishment of a state university at or near the seat of state government" and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a board of regents and administered by a chancellor on july 26 1848 nelson dewey wisconsin's first governor signed the act that formally created the university of wisconsin{14] john h lathrop became the university's first chancellor in the fall of 1849{15] with john w sterling as the university's first professor (mathematics) the first class of 17 students met at madison female academy on february 5 1849 a permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of 50 acres (202xc2xa0ha) "bounded north by fourth lake east by a street to be opened at right angles with king street" {later state street] "south by mineral point road (university avenue) and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake" the regents' building plans called for a "main edifice fronting towards the capitol three stories high surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations"{16] this building university hall now known as bascom hall was finally completed in 1859 on october 10 1916 a fire destroyed the building's dome which was never replaced north hall constructed in 1851 was actually the first building on

wisconsin idea{edit]research teaching and service at the uw is influenced by a tradition known as "the wisconsin idea" first articulated by uwxe2x80x93madison president charles van hise in 1904 when he declared "i shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the university reaches every home in the state"{18] the wisconsin idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state and that the research conducted at uwxe2x80x93madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health quality of life the environment and agriculture for all citizens of the state the wisconsin idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students and the state's industries and government{19] based in wisconsin's populist history the wisconsin idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty staff and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics{20]world war ii{edit]during world war ii university of wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the v-12 navy college training program which offered
