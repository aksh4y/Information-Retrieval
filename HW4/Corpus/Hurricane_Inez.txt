inez was a major hurricane{nb 1] that affected the caribbean bahamas florida and mexico in 1966 it was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas it originated from a tropical wave over africa and became a tropical depression by septemberxc2xa021 it moved slowly westward initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to tropical storm inez on septemberxc2xa024 the storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the french overseas region of guadeloupe on septemberxc2xa027 inez severely damaged the island's banana and sugar crops and thousands of homes were damaged leaving 10000xc2xa0people homeless damage on guadeloupe was estimated at 50xc2xa0million{nb 2] and there were 40xc2xa0deaths after entering the caribbean inez briefly weakened before restrengthening attaining peak sustained winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) on septemberxc2xa028 that day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of 197xc2xa0mph (317xc2xa0kmh) which was the highest recorded at the timecontinuing westward inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the barahona peninsula of the dominican republic there the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800xc2xa0houses nationwide there were about 100xc2xa0deaths and 12xc2xa0million in damage after affecting the country inez struck southwestern haiti where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s as many as 1000xc2xa0people were killed and 60000xc2xa0people were left homeless damage totaled 2035xc2xa0million in haiti prompting the united states government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds inez weakened quickly over hispaniola although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern cuba on septemberxc2xa030 in the country 125000xc2xa0people were forced to evacuate and there were three deaths and 20xc2xa0million in damagethe hurricane moved slowly over cuba for two days before emerging into the atlantic ocean near the bahamas it was expected to continue out to sea although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path in the bahamas heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding which killed five people and left 155xc2xa0million in damage hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the florida keys where 160xc2xa0homes and 190xc2xa0trailers were damaged salt spray damaged crops in the region and there was 5xc2xa0million in damage and four deaths in the straits of florida inez capsized a boat of cuban refugees killing 45xc2xa0people in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig killing 11xc2xa0people the hurricane threatened the northern yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and although it remained offshore inez produced flooding and caused some power outages at its final landfall inez flooded portions of tamaulipas and cut off roads to tampico about 84000xc2xa0people were left homeless and the hurricane destroyed at least 2500xc2xa0houses damage was estimated at 104xc2xa0million and there were 74xc2xa0deaths in mexicocontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 caribbean and bahamas32 united states33 mexico4 aftermath5 see also6 notes7 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the sahara in central africa on septemberxc2xa015 from the monsoon it moved westward in the prevailing winds exiting the west coast of africa on septemberxc2xa018 the precursor to inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave{2] which was considered a tropical depression by septemberxc2xa018 in the annual tropical cyclone summary tracked by satellites the system moved to the west-southwest{3] and was officially classified a tropical depression on septemberxc2xa021 about halfway between the lesser antilles and africa{4] the system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest a hurricane hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the national hurricane center (nhc) to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about 800xc2xa0mi (1300xc2xa0km) east of martinique{3] with warm water temperatures the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center{2] inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified{3] reaching hurricane status on septemberxc2xa026{4]on septemberxc2xa027 inez strengthened to reach winds of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) making it a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale{4] later that day it moved directly over the island of guadeloupe at the time inez was a small cyclone with hurricane-force winds extending 50xc2xa0mi (80xc2xa0km) from the center;{3] meteorologists labeled it as a "micro-hurricane because of its characteristic small tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind"{2] its structure became disrupted by the island and the central pressure rose from 961xc2xa0mbar (284xc2xa0inhg) to 970xc2xa0mbar (29xc2xa0inhg) indicative of weakening however inez re-intensified after entering the eastern caribbean sea reaching a minimum pressure of 929xc2xa0mbar (274xc2xa0inhg) south of puerto rico on septemberxc2xa028 the hurricane hunters reported sustained winds of 197xc2xa0mph (317xc2xa0kmh) at a height of 8000xc2xa0ft (2400xc2xa0m) the strongest winds recorded for the storm the same flight estimated surface winds between 150 to 175xc2xa0mph (241 to 282xc2xa0kmh) near the center{3] the peak intensity listed in the atlantic hurricane database is 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) making inez a strong category 4 hurricane{4]this weather radar image of hurricane inez was taken on september 29 1966 at 0127 utcwhile near peak intensity inez was located about 160xc2xa0mi (260xc2xa0km) southwest of san juan puerto rico and the eye was tracked by radar from the island its increasing outflow caused tropical storm judith to the east over the central atlantic to dissipate on septemberxc2xa029 the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the barahona peninsula and quickly weakened over land it briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of haiti near jacmel the eye emerged into the windward passage near lxc3xa9ogxc3xa2ne although severely weakened the pressure rose to 987xc2xa0mbar (291xc2xa0inhg){3] and the winds decreased to 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) over land however inez quickly re-intensified over water reaching winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) on septemberxc2xa030 before striking southeastern cuba near guantxc3xa1namo bay{4] when inez was over cuba forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storm's future; it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the united states due to a weakness in the ridge to the north the hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of cuba while over water the eye reorganized and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central cuba and emerged into the atlantic ocean on octoberxc2xa02{3]hurricane inez near yucatxc3xa1n peninsulashortly after exiting cuba into the atlantic inez weakened into a tropical storm and was moving northeastward through the bahamas about 24xc2xa0hours later than forecast{3] at the time the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the bermuda high{2] with little outflow and a large diffuse circulation inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions{3] potentially due to a nearby trough{2] the movement slowed and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that "inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the united states mainland than any other storm" on octoberxc2xa03 inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western gulf of mexico over the subsequent few days the eye moved directly over the florida keys from key largo to key west and continued through the gulf of mexico while slowly intensifying on octoberxc2xa07 inez brushed the northern coast of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula with hurricane-force winds by then the ridge had begun to weaken allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward{3] on octoberxc2xa08 inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh){4] with a pressure of 948xc2xa0mbar (280xc2xa0inhg) briefly threatening the coastline of texas inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened on octoberxc2xa010 the hurricane made its final landfall near tampico tamaulipas in northeastern mexico it weakened rapidly over the region's high terrain dissipating on octoberxc2xa011{3]the unusual track of inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the lesser and greater antilles bahamas florida and mexico{3] the associated press described inez as the "first to strike the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula in many years"{5] it was also the first to move across the gulf of mexico without turning to the north so late in the season and the 65xc2xa0advisories issued by the nhc was the highest number at the time the path taken by inez was compared to hurricane betsy in 1965 which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge{3] forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path as well as the inability to fly the hurricane hunters into inez while it was over cuba{6]preparations{edit]in guadeloupe which was the first area the hurricane affected residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters pan american world airways canceled flights to the region{7] when inez was near peak intensity the nhc warned residents in southern haiti and the dominican republic of the danger posed by the hurricane the agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track in general hurricane warnings were issued 24xc2xa0hours in advance with the exception of southeastern florida due to the hurricane's slowing track{3] overall 250000xc2xa0people evacuated along the path of inez{8] at guantxc3xa1namo bay officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters large ships at the port there were moved to jamaica before the storm struck{9] throughout eastern cuba premier fidel castro ordered about 125000xc2xa0people to evacuate in low-lying areas mostly in oriente province{10] united states air force tracking stations in the bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations residents in the florida keys boarded up windows and store fronts{11] and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in key west in southeastern florida government offices and schools closed{12]along the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula about 15000xc2xa0people were evacuated from the coastal city of progreso{5] in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes{13] in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about 65xc2xa0mi (105xc2xa0km) south-southwest of morgan city louisiana in otherwise calm conditions; 11xc2xa0people died including the pilot{14] when inez was approaching its final landfall the united states weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from brownsville to port isabel texas with gale warnings northward to corpus christi at least 2000xc2xa0people evacuated from port isabel alone{15] and many shrimp boats were secured{16] in the tampico area where inez made its final landfall over 31000xc2xa0people evacuated to higher grounds{17]impact{edit]satellite image of inez near peak intensity in the caribbeanoverall hurricane inez killed about 1000xc2xa0people mostly on hispaniola and caused over 200xc2xa0million in damage crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude due to inez's small size and its occurrence late in the season{3]caribbean and bahamas{edit]when inez struck guadeloupe a station on the island reported sustained winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 94xc2xa0mph (151xc2xa0kmh) before communications failed rain on the island reached 65xc2xa0in (170xc2xa0mm){3] the high winds destroyed the roofs of thousands of houses leaving 10000xc2xa0people homeless there was heavy damage to both the banana and sugar crops described as "flattened" by the st petersburg times{18] the storm flooded a power plant in pointe-xc3xa0-pitre and downed many power lines causing power outages{19] the associated press described the hurricane as having "virtually leveled a whole district of pointe-xc3xa0-pitre"{20] hundreds of people were injured although because of damaged hospitals and the power outage most only received makeshift treatment{21] inez left 40xc2xa0people dead and 50xc2xa0million in damage on the island{3]{11] strong winds also affected nearby antigua{7] and damage was reported from that island to dominica{22]in the united states virgin islands a station on st croix reported 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) gusts when inez passed south of puerto rico its rainbands produced gusty winds along the island's southern coast reaching 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) in pexc3xb1uelas on isla de mona wind gusts were estimated at 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh){3] flooding occurred in southern puerto rico and high winds damaged 20xc2xa0houses{20]hurricane inez struck the dominican republic near peak intensity{3] along the barahona peninsula more than 800xc2xa0homes were destroyed and nationwide about 5000xc2xa0people were left homeless there was heavy damage to the country's cotton industry{21] as well as the coffee sugar cane and cocoa crops along the barahona peninsula in the capital city of santo domingo heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the ozama river forcing thousands to evacuate{18] high seas there damaged a portion of a seawall many rivers along the barahona peninsula were also flooded{19] throughout the country inez killed about 100xc2xa0people{3] including 55 in juancho{21] and left 12xc2xa0million in damage{3]in neighboring haiti high winds downed power lines and radio towers which cut outside communication high rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges{21] in a location nicknamed the "valley of death"; there the weather bureau remarked that "local winds may well have exceeded 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh)"{22] thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof{19] the haitian government reported over 1000xc2xa0deaths in the weeks after the storm the united states government reported that the hurricane "killed no more than 50" in haiti and "nor was there a real emergency" due to president franxc3xa7ois duvalier misusing previous aid{23] the us assessment was incorrect as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone summary in the monthly weather review indicated 750xc2xa0deaths in haiti{3] mostly in jacmel president duvalier considered the hurricane the "worst storm since the 1920s"{11] in the country 1000xc2xa0people were injured and 60000 were left homeless and damage was estimated at 2035xc2xa0million{24] throughout hispaniola about 1500xc2xa0people were seriously injured and many people were still recovering from hurricane flora in 1963{22]a station at guantxc3xa1namo bay reported winds of 138xc2xa0mph (222xc2xa0kmh) when inez moved ashore in cuba and rainfall reached 12xc2xa0in (300xc2xa0mm){3] tides were 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) above normal there{22] the hurricane knocked down trees and power lines and many roofs were damaged on the naval base{9] in the city of guantxc3xa1namo the hurricane destroyed 500xc2xa0houses{13] high winds heavily damaged the country's sugar and coffee crops{10] when inez re-entered the gulf of mexico it threatened northwestern cuba and produced 12xc2xa0in (300xc2xa0mm) of rainfall high waves and strong winds affected the coastline{22] in la habana province flooding forced 21000xc2xa0people to evacuate{13] mostly in low-lying areas one building was destroyed in havana{25] nationwide inez injured at least 38xc2xa0people{11] and caused five deaths{3] three of which occurred after inez moved southwestward from the florida keys{13] damage totaled 20xc2xa0million{3]in the bahamas the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall over three days reaching 1431xc2xa0in (363xc2xa0mm) in nassau there inez spawned a small tornado that produced winds of over 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh){3] killing one person and injuring three high tides flooded portions of nassau{22] two waterspouts were reported in freeport wind gusts in the archipelago reached 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) at west end grand bahama and sustained winds reached 64xc2xa0mph (103xc2xa0kmh) in freeport five people died throughout the country and damage was estimated at 155xc2xa0million{3]united states{edit]rainfall summary for hurricane inez in floridain the straits of florida high waves from inez overturned a 24xc2xa0ft (73xc2xa0m) blockade runner carrying cuban exiles to miami ten of the passengers escaped on a damaged raft but the only survivor was the captain;{26] 45xc2xa0people died due to the boat capsizing{3] high waves also disabled three ships and beached a coast guard boat near miami;{12] a lifeguard and people on the beach assisted in rescuing the crew of nine coast guardsmen amid rough seas{22]when the hurricane moved across the florida keys it dropped light rainfall reaching 480xc2xa0in (122xc2xa0mm) near kendall{27] inez was considered a "dry hurricane" and about 1xc2xa0in (25xc2xa0mm) of the precipitation that fell was largely in the form of sea water spray{28] light rainfall occurred in miami where strong winds damaged crops due to salt spray onto local vegetation{29] during its passage inez produced above normal tides reaching 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) above normal on big pine key inez produced strong winds while it was intensifying{3] and the strongest winds occurred after the passage of the eye{22] the highest sustained winds were 98xc2xa0mph (158xc2xa0kmh) on plantation key and peak gusts were 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) in the dry tortugas on big pine key sustained winds were estimated at 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 165xc2xa0mph (266xc2xa0kmh) on the florida mainland the highest gusts were 92xc2xa0mph (148xc2xa0kmh) at flamingo{3] the winds damaged smaller tree limbs and uprooted some trees about 20 of the local avocado crop was blown off trees although most was salvageable winds and salt spray severely damaged vegetables in southern dade county including up to 80 losses of tomatoes in some farms{28] power outages were reported in key west{12] in the florida keys the hurricane damaged 160xc2xa0homes and 190xc2xa0trailers{25] statewide damage totaled 5xc2xa0million{3] and there were four deaths; three were elderly people who died of heart attacks while installing shutters and the fourth was a teenager who was swept by large surf{12] inez was the last hurricane to threaten the miami metropolitan area until hurricane david in 1979{30] and the last hurricane to strike the florida keys until hurricane kate in 1985{31]when inez was making its final landfall in mexico its outer circulation reached southern texas producing winds of 22xc2xa0mph (35xc2xa0kmh) and trace rainfall tides reached 31xc2xa0ft (094xc2xa0m) above normal in corpus christi{3] and 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) waves caused 5000 in damage to piers{32]mexico{edit]while the hurricane was off the north coast of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula inez produced sustained winds of 69xc2xa0mph (111xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 81xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) in mxc3xa9rida{3] the winds cut power and knocked down trees in progreso as well as nearby cities high waves destroyed a dock in telchac puerto{5] heavy rainfall flooded streets in mxc3xa9rida although damage was not severe{33]at the hurricane's final landfall a station in tampico reported sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 127xc2xa0mph (204xc2xa0kmh) before communications were cut inez dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore causing flooding in soto la marina tamaulipas rainfall totaled 1012xc2xa0in (257xc2xa0mm){3] in northeastern mexico more than 3000xc2xa0people were stranded by flooding after dozens of rivers and streams rose above their banks forcing some families to hold onto trees{17] the floods washed out roads around tampico and cut communications and the water supply{34] in tamaulipas 15xc2xa0people died while trying to deliver supplies to residents along the tambesi river{35] throughout the country the hurricane left about 84000xc2xa0people homeless{36] and destroyed at least 2500xc2xa0houses{37] agricultural damage totaled over 80xc2xa0million and property damage was estimated at 24xc2xa0million in tampico and ciudad madero alone{17] overall inez killed 74xc2xa0people in mexico{36]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesin the days after the storm struck guadeloupe there was a food shortage{20] officials quickly cleared roads and worked to restore the damaged banana crop charles de gaulle visited the island and the french population unified to provide assistance to the island{38] in late october 1966 the french government set up a relief fund for guadeloupe totaling 34xc2xa0million (xe2x82xa3170xc2xa0million francs){39] the government initiated plans to rebuild the island to withstand the winds of strong hurricanes{38] the united states agency for international development flew 20000xc2xa0pounds of blankets and clothing to the island{18] due to the heavy damage in hispaniola vmm-365 a united states marine corps helicopter division spent 454xc2xa0hours and flew 740xc2xa0sorties to provide 186676xc2xa0tons of relief supplies to haiti and the dominican republic the division also helped evacuate 142xc2xa0hospital patients{40] the dominican air force also assisted in transporting injured people from outlying areas to santo domingo{21] the country deployed 5000xc2xa0troops to send food medicine and clothing to the storm-damaged areas in the interior{18] as well as barahona peninsula{19] the holy see sent 2000 to assist the residents affected by the storm in haiti{24] after a nearly ten year boycott due to the actions of haitian president franxc3xa7ois duvalier the united states provided a 13xc2xa0million loan to the country to help rebuild infrastructure and provide education industrialist clint murchison gave 50000 in flour and food from a mill he owned in the country{41] the united states also sent vaccines and 4360xc2xa0pounds of food{42]in cuba sailors on the uss america (cv-66) spent about 1700xc2xa0hours to assist guantxc3xa1namo bay in recovery{43] the sole survivor of the sinking boat carrying cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal the man was held responsible for the 44xc2xa0boat deaths and was quickly executed{44] the united states coast guard deployed boats helicopters and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the straits of florida{26] in the united states the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to inez's crop damage in florida and reduced crop output in california{45] the country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the mexican air force{36] as well as trucks by land{17] to deliver tons of supplies including food clothing and medicine to flood-affected areas in tamaulipas{46] in the weeks after the storm many residents had minimal food access and some areas remained flooded conditions in tampico located near where the storm moved ashore gradually returned to normal{36] heavy rainfall in mexico restored reservoirs which assisted future crop growing{47]the name inez was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane name{48]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of retired
