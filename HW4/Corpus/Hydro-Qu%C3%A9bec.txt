distribution of electricity in quebecit was formed by the government of quebec in 1944 from the expropriation of private firms this was followed by massive investment in hydro-electric projects like churchill falls and the james bay project today with 63 hydroelectric power stations the combined output capacity is 36912 megawatts extra power is exported from the province and hydro-quxc3xa9bec supplies 10 per cent of new england's power requirements{3]hydro-quxc3xa9bec is a state-owned enterprise based in montreal in 2015 it paid cad236 billion in dividends to its sole shareholder the government of quxc3xa9bec its residential power rates are among the lowest in north america{4]more than 40 percent of canadaxe2x80x99s water resources are in quxc3xa9bec and hydro-quxc3xa9bec is the

hydroelectric utility protested against high costs poor rural electrification and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies{6] in 1944 montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydro-quxc3xa9bec was created to manage the companiesquebec premier adxc3xa9lard godbout adopted a policy of investing 10 million dollars per year in rural electrification{6] however in 1944 the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy{7] local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until 1960 and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydro-quxc3xa9bec mostly served the montreal areamajor projects included:bersimis-1 generating station completed in 1956 1125 mwbersimis-2 generating station completed in 1959 845 mwthe beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in 1961 1903 mwcarillon generating station built 1959-1964 752 mwbetween 1944 and 1962 hydro-quxc3xa9bec's installed capacity increased from 616 to 3661 mw{8] while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area{9]1960xe2x80x931979: the second nationalisation{edit]the spillway at the robert-bourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river{10] inaugurated in 1979 the 5616 mw generating station was at the heart of a network of 8 hydroelectric stations known as the james bay projectduplessis' conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in 1959 the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydro-quxc3xa9bec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in 1963 the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydro-quxc3xa9bec achieved province-wide scope{11] all of the 46 rural coops accepted hydro-quxc3xa9becxe2x80x99s 1963 buyout offer except saint-jean-baptiste-de-rouville which still exists major projects during this period included:manic-outardes project a 7-dam hydroelectric complex including the jean-lesage generating station (1145 mw) renxc3xa9-lxc3xa9vesque generating station (1244 mw) and the daniel-johnson dam (2596 mw) originally named manic-2 manic-3 and manic-5 respectively because these stations were 700 kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to 735 kv a world first led by engineer jean-jacques archambault{12]churchill falls generating station 5428 mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec{13] forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydro-quxc3xa9bec buys power from the project at 1969 prices until the year 2041{14]phase i of the james bay projecthydro-quxc3xa9bec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in 20121980xe2x80x931996: restructuring{edit]because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s which led to structural changes at hydro-quxc3xa9bec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is quxc3xa9bec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energy-related field{15]in 1986 the quebec xe2x80x93 new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project 1100 kilometers south to the boston areaphase ii of the james bay project started in 1987 and took nine years to complete construction of the denis-perron dam began in 19941997xe2x80x93present: renewed growth{edit]in the late '90s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydro-quxc3xa9bec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydro-quxc3xa9bec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydro-quxc3xa9bec to expand its market hydro-quxc3xa9bec acquired a substantial share of noverco controller of natural gas distributor gaz mxc3xa9tro to participate in that market in northeastern north america{16]the rupert river diversion will channel part of the natural flow of the river (orange on the map) to the robert-bourassa reservoirin 2002 the agreement respecting a new

failure at a substation on the north shore the march 1989 geomagnetic storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour quebec-wide blackoutin the north american ice storm of 1998 five days of freezing rain collapsed 600 kilometres (370xc2xa0mi) of high voltage power lines and over 3000 kilometres (1900xc2xa0mi) of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern quebec up to 14 million customers were without power for up to five weekscorporate structure and financial results{edit]corporate structure{edit]hydro-quxc3xa9bec generation and main transmission network as of 2008like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydro-quxc3xa9bec was reorganized in the late 1990s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydro-quxc3xa9bec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the businessthe transmission division transxc3x89nergie was the first to be spun off in 1997 in response to the us federal energy regulatory commission's publication of order 888{19] the restructuring was completed in the year 2000 with the adoption of bill 116 which amended the act respecting the rxc3xa9gie de l'xc3xa9nergie{20] to enact the functional separation of hydro-quxc3xa9bec's various business unitsthis functional separation and the creation of a so-called "heritage pool" (french: volume patrimonial) of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january 2000 report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the "quebec social pact"; namely low uniform and stable rates across the province "particularly in the residential sector"{21]legislation passed in 2000 commits the generation division hydro-quxc3xa9bec production to provide the distribution division hydro-quxc3xa9bec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to 165 twh of energy plus ancillary servicesxe2x80x94including an extra 139 twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of 34342 mw{22]xe2x80x94at a set price of 279xc2xa2 per kwh order in council 1277-2001 specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the 8760 hourly intervals which vary from 11420 to 34342 mw{23]hydro-quxc3xa9bec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needsxe2x80x94approximately 82 twh in 2007{24] xe2x80x94 by calling for tenders for long-term contracts open to all suppliers including hydro-quxc3xa9bec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro{25] for instance hydro-quxc3xa9bec distribution launched calls for tenders in 2003 and 2005 for 1000 and 2000 mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in 2006 and the 23 wind farms under contract should be completely on-line by december 2015{26]the transxc3x89nergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the rxc3xa9gie de l'xc3xa9nergie du quxc3xa9bec (quebec energy board) an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a cost-of-service approach the rxc3xa9gie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distribution-related capital expenditure project exceeding c10 million; approval of the terms of service and of long-term supply contracts; dealing with customer complaints; and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid{27]the generation division hydro-quxc3xa9bec production is not subject to regulation by the rxc3xa9gie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnementhydro-quxc3xa9bec employed 23659 people in 2009{28] including 2060

c7284 billion down by c159 million from 2010 mainly due to lower short-term electricity and fuel purchases and the repeal of quebec's capital tax{33]the company has assets of c69637 billion c56901

same periodprivatization debate{edit]the hydro-quxc3xa9bec building is a landmark of montreal's downtownin 1981 the parti quxc3xa9bxc3xa9cois government redefined hydro-quxc3xa9bec's mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of 1944 the government issued itself 43741090 shares worth c100 each{37] and the amended statute stated that hydro-quxc3xa9bec would now pay up to 75 of its net earnings in dividends{38] this amendment to the hydro-quxc3xa9bec act started an episodic debate on whether hydro-quxc3xa9bec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garciaxe2x80x94both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institutexe2x80x94have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt{39]{40]without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action dxc3xa9mocratique du quxc3xa9bec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydro-quxc3xa9bec during the 2008 election campaign{41] a lxc3xa9ger marketing poll conducted in november 2008 found that a majority of quebec respondents (53) were opposed to his proposal to sell 75 of the company's equity to quebec citizens and businesses while 38 were in favor{42]commenting on the issue on guy a lepage's talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydro-quxc3xa9bec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride{43] this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydro-quxc3xa9bec is not for sale{44]like many other economists{45]{46] yvan allaire from montreal's hautes xc3xa9tudes commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the government's annual dividend without resorting to privatization{47] others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenay's le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebec's natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices "for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures"{48]left-wing academics such as uqam's lxc3xa9o-paul lauzon and gabriel sainte-marie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be short-selling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gain{49]{50]activities{edit]power generation{edit]further information: list of power stations in quebecthe daniel-johnson dam on the manicouagan river supplying the manic-5 hydro

electricity bought on the markets account for most of these emissions{51]transmission system{edit]main article: hydro-quxc3xa9bec's electricity transmission systemthe micoua substation on the north shore of quebec this facility converts 315 kv power coming from five hydro plant to 735 kv this transxc3x89nergie facility is one of the main nodes of the 11422-kilometre (7097xc2xa0mi) long 735 kv networkhydro-quxc3xa9bec's expertise at building and operating a very high voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry{61]{62] transxc3x89nergie hydro-quxc3xa9bec's transmission division operates the largest electricity transmission network in north america it acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the quxc3xa9bec interconnection of the north american electric reliability corporation system and is part of the northeast power coordinating council (npcc) transxc3x89nergie manages the flow of energy on the quebec network and ensures non-discriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market{63] the non-discriminatory access policy allows a company such as nalcor to sell some of its share of power from churchill falls on the open market in the state of new york using transxc3x89nergie's network upon payment of a transmission fee{64]{65]in recent years transxc3x89nergie's contrxc3xb4le des mouvements d'xc3xa9nergie (cmxc3x89) unit has been acting as the reliability coordinator of the bulk electricity network for quebec as a whole under a bilateral agreement between the rxc3xa9gie de l'xc3xa9nergie du quxc3xa9bec and the federal energy regulatory commission of the united states{66]transxc3x89nergie's high voltage network stretches over 33630xc2xa0km (20900xc2xa0mi) including 11422xc2xa0km (7097xc2xa0mi) of 765 and 735 kv lines and a network of 514 substations{67] it is connected to neighbouring canadian provinces and the united states by 17 ties with a maximum reception capacity of 10850 mw{note 3] and a maximum transmission capacity of 7994 mw{68]interconnections{edit]a rectifier at the outaouais substation located in l'ange-gardien the 1250 mw back-to-back hvdc tie links the quebec grid with ontario's hydro one networkthe transxc3x89nergie's network operates asynchronously from that of its neighbours on the eastern interconnection although quebec uses the same 60 hertz frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks{69] transxc3x89nergie mainly relies on back to back hvdc converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictionsthis feature of the quebec network allowed hydro-quxc3xa9bec to remain unscathed during the northeast blackout of august 14 2003 with the exception of 5 hydro plants on the ottawa river radially connected to the ontario grid at the time{70] a new 1250-mw back to back hvdc tie has been commissioned at the outaouais substation in l'ange-gardien near the ontario border the new interconnection has been online since 2009 and the 315 kv line is fully operational since 2010{69]one drawback of the transxc3x89nergie network involves the long distances separating the generation sites and the main consumer markets for instance the radisson substation links the james bay project plants to the nicolet station near sainte-eulalie south of the saint lawrence over 1200 kilometres (750xc2xa0mi) away{71]investments{edit]in 2011 transxc3x89nergie invested c13 billion in capital expenditures including c460 million to expand its network{72]in addition to the new tie with ontario the company plans to build a new 1200-mw direct current link between the des cantons substation at windsor quebec in quebec's eastern townships and deerfield new hampshire with an hvdc converter terminal built at franklin new hampshire{73] the us segment of the us11 billion line{74] would be built by northern pass transmission llc a partnership between northeast utilities (75) and nstar (25){75] in order to go ahead the project must receive regulatory approval in quebec and the united states the proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015{76] according to jim robb a senior executive from northeast utilities new england could meet one third of its regional greenhouse gas initiative commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alone{77]distribution{edit]an hydro-quxc3xa9bec employee carries out the replacement of an underground transformer in montrealhydro-quxc3xa9bec distribution is in charge of retail sales to most customers in quebec it operates a network of 112089 kilometres (69649xc2xa0mi) of medium and low voltage lines{78] the

and westmountxe2x80x94and the electric cooperative of saint-jean-baptiste de rouville{79]hydro-quxc3xa9bec distribution buys most of its power from the 165-twh heritage pool provided by hydro-quxc3xa9bec production at 279xc2xa2kwh the division usually purchases additional power by entering into long-term contracts after a public call for tenders for shorter term needs it also buys power from the neighboring systems at market prices as a last resort hydro-quxc3xa9bec production can also provide short-term relief{31] supply contracts above and beyond the heritage pool must be

vehicle from the 2012 montreal international auto showhydro-quxc3xa9bec has made significant investments in research and development over the past 40 years in addition to funding university research the company is the only electric utility in north america to operate its own large-scale research institute l'institut de recherche d'hydro-quxc3xa9bec (ireq) established by lionel boulet in 1967 the research centre is located in varennes a suburb on the south shore of montreal{81] ireq operates on an annual research budget of approximately c100 million{82] and specializes in the areas of high voltage mechanics and thermomechanics network simulations and calibration{83]research conducted by scientists and engineers at ireq has helped to extend the life of dams improve water turbine performance automate network management and increase the transmission capacity of high voltage power lines{84]another research centre the laboratoire des technologies de l'xc3xa9nergie (lte) in shawinigan was opened in 1988{85] to adapt and develop new products while helping industrial customers improve their energy efficiency{86]in the last 20 years the institute has also conducted research and development work towards the electrification of ground transportation current projects include battery materials including innovative work on lithium iron phosphate and nano-titanate{87] improved electric drive trains and the effects of the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles on the power grid{88] projects focus on technologies to increase range improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging time{89]hydro-quxc3xa9bec has been criticized for not having taken advantage of some of its innovations an electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with quebecers{90] first prototyped in 1994 by pierre couture an engineer and physicist working at ireq is one of these{91]{92] the heir to the couture wheel motor is now marketed by tm4 electrodynamic systems a spin-off established in 1998{93] that has made deals with france's dassault and heuliez to develop an electric car the cleanova of which prototypes were built in 2006{94] hydro-quxc3xa9bec announced in early 2009 at the montreal international auto show that its engine had been chosen by tata motors to equip a demonstration version of its indica model which will be road tested in norway{95]{96]construction{edit]the hydro-quxc3xa9bec xc3x89quipement division acts as the company's main contractor on major construction sites with the exception of work conducted on the territory covered by the james bay and northern quebec agreement which are assigned to the socixc3xa9txc3xa9 d'xc3xa9nergie de la baie james subsidiarythe construction of a complex of four hydroelectric generating stations on the romaine river (1550 mw) began on may 13 2009{97] the plants are scheduled to be built and commissioned between 2014 and 2020{98]in his march 2009 inaugural speech quebec premier jean charest announced that his government intends to further develop the province's hydroelectric potential{99] the call for further development of hydroelectric and other renewable generating capacity has been implemented in the company's 2009-2013 strategic plan released on july 30 2009 hydro-quxc3xa9bec plans capacity upgrades at the jean-lesage (120 mw) and renxc3xa9-lxc3xa9vesque (210 mw) stations and a third unit at the sm-3 plant (440 mw) the company will also conduct technical and environmental studies and undertake consultations with local communities to build new facilities on the petit-mxc3xa9catina (1200 mw) and magpie (850 mw) rivers on the north shore and revive the tabaret project (132 mw) in the abitibi-txc3xa9miscamingue region in western quebec{100]international ventures{edit]hydro-quxc3xa9bec first forays outside its borders began in 1978 a new subsidiary hydro-quxc3xa9bec international was created to market the company's know-how abroad in the fields of distribution generation and transmission of electricity the new venture leveraged the existing pool of expertise in the parent company{101]during the next 25 years hydro-quxc3xa9bec was particularly active abroad with investments in electricity transmission networks and generation: transelec in chile{102] the cross sound cable in the united states{62] the consorcio transmantaro in peru hidroelectrica rio lajas in costa rica murraylink in australia and the fortuna generating station in panama{103]it briefly held a 17 share in senelec senegal's electric utility when the senegalese government decided to sell part of the company to a consortium led by the french company elyo a subsidiary of group suez lyonnaise des eaux in 1999{104] the transaction was canceled in 2000 following the election of president abdoulaye wade{105]also in 1999 hydro-quxc3xa9bec international acquired a 20 stake in the meiya power company in china for c83 million{104] the company held this participation until july 2004{106] the company's expertise was sought by several hydroelectric developers throughout the world including the three gorges dam where hydro's employees trained chinese engineers in the fields of management finance and dams{107]hydro-quxc3xa9bec gradually withdrew from the international business between 2003 and 2006 and sold off all of its foreign investments for a profit proceeds from these sales were paid to the government's generations fund a trust fund set up by the province to alleviate the effect of public debt on future generations{108]environment{edit]the northern pike (esox lucius) is more prevalent today in the robert-bourassa reservoir than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye (stizostedion vitreum) population{109]the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydro-quxc3xa9bec's activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain{110] it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs{111] and contributes to shoreline erosionin addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilitiessince the early 1970s hydro-quxc3xa9bec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in 1972 the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacques-cartier river valley in 1973 and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in 1975 forced the company to reconsider its practices{112]to address environmental concerns hydro-quxc3xa9bec established an environmental protection committee in 1970 and an environmental management unit in september 1973{113] its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific communityeffects on the natural environment{edit]the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between 1970 and 2000{114]in the late 1970s the company set up a network of 27 monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project{115] which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first 30 years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by 3 to 6 times over the first 5 to 10 years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after 20 to 30 years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland{114] research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a population's diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots{114]despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded{116]emissions of greenhouse gases (ghg) rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after 10 years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes{111] gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around 30000 tonnes of co2 equivalent per twh of generated power{117] hydro-quxc3xa9bec claims its hydroelectric plants release 35 times less ghg than comparable gas-fired plants and 70 times less than coal-fired ones and that they constitute the "option with the best performance" overall{111]social effects and sustainable development{edit]of all cree communities chisasibi was most affected by the james bay hydroelectric development project{114] crees living on fort george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in 1980-1981another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement{116]some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point "where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south" notes an hydro-quxc3xa9bec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between 1970 and 2000 the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the 1990s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area "will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players"{116]after the strong rejection of the suroxc3xaet project and its subsequent cancellation in november 2004 hydro-quxc3xa9bec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydro-quxc3xa9bec's commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy{118] since then hydro-quxc3xa9bec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company: projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities{31] hydro-quxc3xa9bec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late 1980s its approach is based on three principles: economic development social development and environmental protection{119] since 2007 the company adheres to the global reporting initiative{120] which governs the collection and publication of sustainability performance information the company employs 250 professionals and managers in the environmental field and has implemented an iso 14001-certified environmental management system{121]rates and customers{edit]quebec

of hydro-quxc3xa9bec residential rates (turquoise) and the quebec consumer price index (dark blue) between 1998 and 2011at the end of 2010 hydro-quxc3xa9bec served 4060195 customers{122] grouped into three broad categories: residential and farm (d rate) commercial and institutional (g rate) and industrial (m and l rates) the other category includes public lighting systems and municipal distribution systemsabout a dozen distribution rates are set annually by the rxc3xa9gie de l'xc3xa9nergie after public hearings pricing is based on the cost of delivery which includes the cost of supply and transmission depreciation on fixed assets and provisions for the maintenance of facilities customer growth and a profit marginrates are uniform throughout quebec and are based on consumer type and volume of consumption all rates vary in block to mitigate any cross-subsidization effect between residential commercial and industrial customershydro-quxc3xa9bec retail rates are among the lowest in north america{123] after a five-year rate freeze between may 1 1998 and january 1 2004{124] the rxc3xa9gie granted rate increases on 8 occasions between 2004 and 2010 for a total of 184{125] more recently the regulator ordered two successive rate rollbacks in 2011 (04) and 2012 (05) however rates are expected to go up by 37 a year from 2014 to 2018 to reflect a gradual increase of heritage pool electricity announced in the 2010 quebec budget{126]residential customers{edit]electric heating accounts for more than half of the electricity used by residential customers in quebec according to hydro-quxc3xa9becthe average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at 16857 kwh per year in 2011{122] because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space (77) and water heating (90){127] hydro-quxc3xa9bec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector{128]this preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebec's very cold climate in winter greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only 55 (465 mt co2 eq) of all emissions in quebec in 2006 emissions from the residential sector in quebec fell by 30 between 1990 and 2006{129]residential use of electricity fluctuates from one year to another and is strongly correlated with the weather contrary to the trend in neighboring networks hydro-quxc3xa9bec's system is winter-peaking a new all-time consumption record was set on january 23 2013 with a load of 38910 mw{130] previous records were established on january 24 2011 with 37717 mw on january 16 2009 with a load of 37230 mw{131]{132] and on january 15 2004 when peak reached 36268 mw{133]a hydro-quxc3xa9bec digital power meterthe price of electricity for residences and farms includes a 4064xc2xa2 daily subscription fee and two price levels depending on consumption the rates are all-included: power transmission and distribution costs but are subject to the goods and services tax (gst) and the quebec sales tax (qst){134] as of april 1 2012 customers pay 532xc2xa2kwh for the first 30 daily kwh while the remainder is sold at 751xc2xa2kwh{135] the average monthly bill for a residential customer was approximately c100 in 2008{136]electric meter readings are usually conducted every two months and bills are bimonthly however the company offers an optional equalized payment plan allowing residential customers to pay their annual electricity costs in 12 monthly installments based on past consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that location{137]in 2007 hydro-quxc3xa9bec pulled out of a canadian government initiative to install smart meters across the province stating that it would be "too costly to deliver real savings"{138] since then hydro-quxc3xa9bec organized a 2-year pilot project involving 2000 customers in 4 cities with time of use metering a report filed with the rxc3xa9gie de l'xc3xa9nergie in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of marginal cost pricing with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings{139] the company intends to gradually phase-in advanced metering infrastructure (ami) between 2011 and 2017 early efforts will focus on meter data transfer connect-disconnect outage detection and theft reduction{140]industrial customers{edit]rio tinto alcan's laterriere smelter in saguenay large industrial users especially the metallurgy and the pulp and paper industries use 406 of all electricity sold in quebecfor more than a century industrial development in quebec has been stimulated by the abundance of hydroelectric resources energy represents a significant expenditure in the pulp and paper and aluminum sectors two industries with long-standing traditions in quebec in 2010 industrial customers purchased 684 twh from hydro-quxc3xa9bec representing 404 of all electricity sold by the company on the domestic market{141]the smurfit-stone paper mill in la tuquethe quebec government uses low electricity rates to attract new business and consolidate existing jobs despite its statutory obligation to sell electric power to every person who so requests the province has reserved the right to grant large load allocations to companies on a case by case basis since 1974 the threshold was set at 175 mw from 1987 to 2006{142] and was reduced to 50 mw in the government's 2006xe2x80x932015 energy strategy{143]large industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers because of lower distribution costs in 2010 the largest industrial users the rate l customers were paying an average of 466xc2xa2kwh whereas companies with special contracts paid 307xc2xa2kwh{144]in 1987 hydro-quxc3xa9bec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar{145] those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rateson may 10 2007 the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the company's merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in montreal{146]on december 19 2008 hydro-quxc3xa9bec and alcoa signed a similar agreement this agreement which expires in 2040 maintains the provision of electricity to alcoa's three aluminum smelters in the province located in baie-comeau bxc3xa9cancour and deschambault-grondines in addition the deal will allow alcoa to modernize the baie-comeau plant which will increase its production capacity by 110000 tonnes a year to a total of 548000 tonnes{147]several economists including universitxc3xa9 laval's jean-thomas bernard and gxc3xa9rard bxc3xa9langer have challenged the government's strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in 2008 the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between c255357 and c729653 a year when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the new york market{148]this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa "we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets" said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebec's large industrial customers in his opinion the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher{149]export markets{edit]hydro-quxc3xa9bec exports and brokerage activities in canada and the united states

million for a transaction volume of 233 twh despite "exceptionally low runoff" according to the company net exports accounted for a net income of 1034 million and a net reservoir drawdown of 125 twh{152]although most export sales are now short-term transactions hydro-quxc3xa9bec has entered into long-term export contracts in the past in 1990 the company signed a 328-mw deal with a group of 13 electric distributors in vermont exports from hydro-quxc3xa9bec account for 28 of all power used in the state{153] on march 11 2010 vermont's two largest utilities green mountain power and central vermont public service entered into a tentative 26-year deal with hydro-quxc3xa9bec to purchase up to 225 mw of hydro power from 2012 to 2038 the memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding vermont customers from market price spikes the deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as "renewable energy"{154]the renewable energy law h781{155] was adopted by both houses of the legislature and signed into law by governor jim douglas on june 4 2010{156]a second contract has been signed with cornwall electric a subsidiary of fortis inc a utility serving 23000 customers in the cornwall ontario area the contract was renewed in 2008 and will be in force until 2019{157]the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydro-quxc3xa9bec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices{158]the election of barack obamaxe2x80x94a supporter of renewable energy greenhouse gas emissions trading and the development of electric carsxe2x80x94as president of the united states in 2008 was seen as a positive development for the company's outlook despite the success of the previous policy of short-term sales on neighboring energy markets the quebec government asked hydro-quxc3xa9bec management to write a new strategic plan focusing on long-term sale agreements with us distributors as was the case after the commissioning of the james bay project{159] the new plan was released in july 2009hydro-quxc3xa9bec crews were also loaned to the new york
