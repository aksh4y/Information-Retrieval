it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces separating the parts (registration group registrant publication and check digit) of a 10-digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or

isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded in canada isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture{14] in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations the issuing of isbns requires payment of a feeaustralia: isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe-bowker{15] and prices range from 42 for a single isbn (plus a 55 registration fee for new publishers) to 2890 for a block of 1000 isbns access is

national isbn registration agency a directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency websiteregistration group identifier the registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (ie one of 978 or 979){11] registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element{29] the single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are: 0 or 1 for english-speaking countries; 2 for french-speaking countries; 3 for german-speaking countries; 4 for japan; 5 for russian-speaking countries;

france 11 for the republic of korea and 12 for italy{32]the original 9-digit standard book number (sbn) had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit sbn creates a valid 10-digit isbnregistrant elementthe national isbn agency assigns the registrant element (cf category:isbn agencies) and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn; however most bookstores only handle isbn bearing publications{citation needed]a listing of more than 900000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form (xe2x82xac1399 us1959) the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes{33] partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the english-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishersby using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements{34] here are some sample isbn-10 codes illustrating block length

digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with "0" will give the same check-digit as without xe2x80x93 the digit is base eleven and can be 0-9 or x the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an "x"isbn-10 check digitsthe 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn-10 check digit{36] xe2x80x93 which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn xe2x80x93 must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol x is used for 10) and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its (integer) weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11for example for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-2:s=(0xc3x9710)+(3xc3x979)+(0xc3x978)+(6xc3x977)+(4xc3x976)+(0xc3x975)+(6xc3x974)+(1xc3x973)+(5xc3x972)+(2xc3x971)=0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10+2=132=12xc3x9711{displaystyle

true for isbn-10's that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this example:s=(0xc3x971)+(3xc3x972)+(0xc3x973)+(6xc3x974)+(4xc3x975)+(0xc3x976)+(6xc3x977)+(1xc3x978)+(5xc3x979)+(2xc3x9710)=0+6+0+24+20+0+42+8+45+20=165=15xc3x9711{displaystyle {egin{aligned}s=(0imes

handling an isbn (eg typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proved that all possible valid isbn-10's have at least two digits different from each other it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid isbn-10's with eight identical digits and two transposed digits (these are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long and because 11 is a prime number) the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbnxc2xa0xe2x80x93 the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11 however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid isbn{37]in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non-transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn (although it is still unlikely)isbn-10 check digit calculationeach of the first nine digits of the ten-digit isbnxe2x80x94excluding the check digit itselfxe2x80x94is multiplied by its (integer) weight descending from 10 to 2 and the sum of these nine products found the value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of 11for example the check digit for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:s=(0xc3x9710)+(3xc3x979)+(0xc3x978)+(6xc3x977)+(4xc3x976)+(0xc3x975)+(6xc3x974)+(1xc3x973)+(5xc3x972)=130{displaystyle {egin{aligned}s=(0imes 10)+(3imes 9)+(0imes 8)+(6imes 7)+(4imes 6)+(0imes 5)+(6imes 4)+(1imes 3)+(5imes 2)=130end{aligned}}}adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) xe2x88x92 this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so therefore the check digit has to be 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0-306-40615-2 the value x10{displaystyle x_{10}} required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so an 'x' should be usedalternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 the remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (ie its value modulo 11) is computed this remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 xe2x80x93 0 = 11 which is invalid (strictly speaking the first "modulo 11" is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation)for example the check digit for the isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:s=(11xe2x88x92(((0xc3x9710)+(3xc3x979)+(0xc3x978)+(6xc3x977)+(4xc3x976)+(0xc3x975)+(6xc3x974)+(1xc3x973)+(5xc3x972))mod11)mod11=(11xe2x88x92(0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10)mod11)mod11=(11xe2x88x92(130mod11))mod11=(11xe2x88x92(9))mod11=(2)mod11=2{displaystyle {egin{aligned}s=(11-(((0imes 10)+(3imes 9)+(0imes 8)+(6imes 7)+(4imes 6)+(0imes 5)+(6imes 4)+(1imes 3)+(5imes 2)){mod {}}11){mod {}}11=(11-(0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10){mod {}}11){mod {}}11=(11-(130{mod {}}11)){mod {}}11=(11-(9)){mod {}}11=(2){mod {}}11=2end{aligned}}}thus the check digit is 2it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples: returns isbn error syndrome zero for a valid isbn non-zero for an invalid one digits{i] must be between 0 and 10int checkisbn(int const digits{10]){        int i s = 0 t = 0;        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {                t += digits{i];                s += t;        }        return s  11;}the modular reduction can be done once at the end as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 99999-999-9-x) or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each additionisbn-13 check digit calculationthe 2005 edition of the international isbn agency's official manual{38] describes how the 13-digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn-13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its (integer) weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10formally using modular arithmetic we can say:(x1+3x2+x3+3x4+x5+3x6+x7+3x8+x9+3x10+x11+3x12+x13)xe2x89xa10(mod10){displaystyle (x_{1}+3x_{2}+x_{3}+3x_{4}+x_{5}+3x_{6}+x_{7}+3x_{8}+x_{9}+3x_{10}+x_{11}+3x_{12}+x_{13})equiv 0{pmod {10}}}the calculation of an isbn-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn (thus excluding the check digit itself) each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero (0) replaces a ten (10) so in all cases a single check digit resultsfor example the isbn-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:s = 9xc3x971 + 7xc3x973 + 8xc3x971 + 0xc3x973 + 3xc3x971 + 0xc3x973 + 6xc3x971 + 4xc3x973 + 0xc3x971 + 6xc3x973 + 1xc3x971 + 5xc3x973  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15  = 9393  10 = 9 remainder 310 xe2x80x93  3 = 7thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7in general the isbn-13 check digit is calculated as followsletr=(10xe2x88x92(x1+3x2+x3+3x4+xe2x8bxaf+x11+3x12)mod10){displaystyle r={ig (}10-{ig

check systemxc2xa0xe2x80x93 similar to the upc check digit formulaxc2xa0xe2x80x93 does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3xc3x976+1xc3x971 = 19 to the sum; while if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6) the contribution of those two digits will be 3xc3x971+1xc3x976 = 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result: both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digitadditionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th) the total will always be divisible by 10 (ie end in 0)isbn-10 to isbn-13 conversionthe conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix "978" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn-13 algorithmerrors in usagepublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers{39] for example isbnxc2xa00-590-76484-5 is shared by two books xe2x80x93 ninja gaidenxc2xaexc2xa0: a novel based on the best-selling game by tecmo (1990) and wacky laws (1997) both published by scholasticmost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase "cancelled isbn"{40] however book-ordering systems such as amazoncom will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search engine{citation needed] oclc often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member libraryeisbnonly the term "isbn" should be used; the terms "eisbn" and "e-isbn" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided if a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats each of those formats must have its own isbn in other words each of the three separate epub amazon kindle and pdf formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn they should not share the isbn of the paper version and there is no generic "eisbn" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title{41]ean format used in barcodes and upgradingcurrently the barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are ean-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price{42] for 10 digit isbns the number "978" the bookland "country code" is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula (modulo 10 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits)partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization (iso) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit isbn (isbn-13) the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007{43] as of 2011 all the 13-digit isbns began with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn 10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an "m" letter; the bar code represents the "m" as a zero (0) and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by isbnpublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the ten-digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit isbn check digit because the gtin-13 is part of the global trade item number (gtin) system (that includes the gtin-14 the gtin-12 and the gtin-8) the 13-digit isbn falls within the 14-digit data field range{44]barcode format compatibility is maintained because (aside from the group breaks) the isbn-13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10-digit isbns so migration to an ean-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers (eg barnes  noble) migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean-13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean-13 in 2005 eased migration to the isbn-13 in north americasee alsoasin (amazon standard identification number)coden (serial publication identifier

springer books in english have publisher code 817 and 0-817-96331-? would also get check digitxc2xa0? = 6 this suggests special considerations were made for assigning springer's publisher codes as
