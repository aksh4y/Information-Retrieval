andpacific hurricane seasonshurricane diana was the deadliest tropical cyclone during the 1990 atlantic hurricane season killing 139 people in mexico forming out of a tropical wave on augustxc2xa04 the system brushed honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day gradually gaining strength diana struck the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula with winds of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) due land interaction the cyclone weakened slightly before moving over the warm waters of the bay of campeche on augustxc2xa06 once over water the diana quickly became a hurricane and later reached its peak intensity on augustxc2xa07 as a categoryxc2xa02 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale shortly thereafter the storm made landfall near tampico tamaulipas with winds of 100xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of mexico and diana diminished to a tropical depression roughly 24xc2xa0hours after moving onshore the cyclone later emerged into the gulf of california on augustxc2xa09 before dissipating though its remnants were monitored until augustxc2xa014 when the system lost its identity over arizonathroughout mexico hurricane diana produced torrential rains that triggered deadly flooding and landslides roughly 155xc2xa0mixc2xb2 (400xc2xa0kmxc2xb2) of farmland was destroyed and 30000 people were left homeless by the storm numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris cutting communication with several communities in all 139 people were killed in the country and 90xc2xa0million (1990xc2xa0usd) was wrought in damage due to the extensive loss of life and damage caused by the storm the name diana was retired the following year and replaced with dolly which was first used in the 1996 seasoncontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 mexico32 elsewhere4 see also5 references6 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of hurricane diana were from a tropical wave that existed western africa into the atlantic on july 27 conditions were unfavorable for development of a tropical cyclone and the tropical wave remained disorganized until reaching the eastern caribbean sea the system entered the caribbean sea through the southern windward islands where falling barometric pressures were observed decreasing by 35xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 01xc2xa0inhg) in 24 hours upper-level air data from the lesser antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone with increasing convection the first air force reconnaissance plane flight indicated no low-level circulation but a relatively large amount of thunderstorm activity the system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the netherlands antilles as indicated by satellite images and surface observations cyclonic rotation was observed in the low-level convection by satellite images and the fifth tropical depression of the season had developed at 0000 utc on august 4 situated in the southwestern caribbean sea however this was based on surface observations and it was not confirmed that tropical cyclone formation occurred until later that day{1]the new tropical depression moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough and rapidly intensified to a tropical storm the following day offshore of eastern honduras; the national hurricane center assigned the name diana to the system becoming a tropical storm diana further intensified and winds reached 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) before landfall in felipe carrillo puerto in quintana roo occurred the storm initially rapidly weakened over land although it retained winds of 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) until moving over open waters when diana entered the southern gulf of mexico the trough of low pressure in that vicinity weakened and steering currents caused the storm to head westward conditions became more favorable in the gulf of mexico and diana quickly intensified becoming a hurricane late on august 7 hurricane diana rapidly intensified and briefly reached category 2 hurricane status attaining peak intensity with winds of 100xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2894xc2xa0inhg) only two hours after attaining peak intensity on august 7 hurricane diana made landfall near tampico tamaulipas at the same intensity{1]moving inland diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of mexico quickly deteriorating from a low-end category 2 hurricane to a strong tropical storm within four hours diana continued westward over mexico and weakened to a tropical depression on august 8 while centered near mexico city the weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central mexico and emerged into the pacific ocean on august 9 before dissipating in the gulf of california{1] the remnants of hurricane diana curved northward and tracked through the gulf of california and eventually came ashore in northwestern sonora crossing northwestern mexico the remnants of diana entered arizona and quickly dissipated{2]preparations{edit]see also: tropical cyclone warnings and watches xc2xa7xc2xa0north atlantic systemsin anticipation of diana's first landfall a tropical storm warning was issued on augustxc2xa05 for cancxc3xban mexico southward to belize city belize on augustxc2xa05 including the offshore islands from both nations; a tropical storm warning indicates that tropical storm force winds 39 to 73xc2xa0mph (39 to 118xc2xa0kmh) are expected within 24xc2xa0hours eleven hours later the tropical storm warning was extended as far as carmen but was discontinued for the entire east coast of belize{3] residents along coastal areas of quintana roo were advised to evacuate inland{4] as tides were expected to range from 3 to 5xc2xa0ft (091 to 152xc2xa0m) above normal{5] emergency officials set up shelters were set up in xcalak punta herrero and punta allen{4] the mexican coast guard was placed on alert and shipping across quantana roo was suspended during the evening of augustxc2xa05 additionally there were concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of 5 to 8xc2xa0in (130 to 200xc2xa0mm) of rainfall in areas near the storm's path{5] after diana made landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on august 6 all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinued{3]diana then threatened the mainland east coast of mexico a hurricane watch was issued for tuxpan to boca de jesus maria at 21:00xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa06; a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours such as winds of at least 74xc2xa0mph (119xc2xa0kmh) early on august 7 the national hurricane center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours and as a result a hurricane warning was issued for nautla to le pesca simultaneously a tropical storm warning was issued for la pesca to boca de jesus maria later that day a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area stretching from nautla to lerdo de tejada{3] the national hurricane center also predicted precipitation totals of 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where diana was projected to make landfall{6] according to miguelangel rebolledo the captain of the port of tuxpan about 300xc2xa0people fled low-lying areas{7] state and federal officials prepared 10000xc2xa0packages of emergency supplies food and medicine and moved them to several locations along the coast police and armed forces were placed on alert{8] by 00:00xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa08 all of the watches and warnings in place were officially discontinued{3]impact{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesrainfall from diana in mexicomexico{edit]offshore quintana roo the island cozumel of reported sustained winds of 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh){9] while crossing over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula sustained winds of 34xc2xa0mph (54xc2xa0kmh) and gusts to 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh) were observed in mxc3xa9rida in addition wind gusts of 37 and 45xc2xa0mph (60 and 73xc2xa0kmh) were reported in the towns of felipe carrillo puerto and josxc3xa9 marxc3xada morelos respectively{10] diana also caused heavy rain across the area though damage is unknown{11] due to heavy rainfall minor street flooding occurred in chetumal quintana roo{12]rough seas were reported mainly between coatzacoalcos and tampico; the ports of those two cities were closed during the passage of diana according to the servicio meteorolxc3xb3gico nacional while passing through the bay of campeche and the southern gulf of mexico diana produced waves up to 12xc2xa0ft (36xc2xa0m) in height{13] on mainland mexico the states of veracruz hidalgo and puebla were hardest hit with over 75000 people affected by the hurricane{14] in poza rica high winds toppled trees and electricity poles which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city fallen trees and telephone wires also blocked some streets in the area but the major roads remained open{7]diana produced torrential rainfall while crossing the country which peaked at 2192xc2xa0in (557xc2xa0mm) in aquismxc3xb3n san luis potosxc3xad{2] heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and flooding mostly in the east-central portion of mexico the rainfall caused extensive property damage destroying numerous houses and leaving 3500 homeless{15] the torrential rain blocked highways and railways across six states furthermore the flooding also destroyed 155xc2xa0mixc2xb2 (400xc2xa0kmxc2xb2) of farmland in addition it is estimated that diana injured 25000 people{14] several miners were reported dead after their truck plunged into a ravine{16] excluding the 56 people that were missing by the end of 1990 hurricane diana caused 139 deaths and 907xc2xa0million in damage (1990xc2xa0usd){14] however some sources claim that there were as much as 391xc2xa0fatalities and losses incurred by the storm totaled to 945xc2xa0million (1990xc2xa0usd){17]following the storm the mexican armed forces delivered food and basic health care supplies in addition there was also a mass vaccination against typhoid{18]elsewhere{edit]while diana was crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula it dropped light rainfall in belize peaking at 1xc2xa0in (25xc2xa0mm) in an unspecified location{19] the remnants of hurricane diana eventually moved into the southwestern united states bringing heavy rainfall to the region{2] in imperial county california golf-ball sized hail was reported by the residents along with rain and lightning causing briefly power outages throughout the county a police dispatch of imperial county also noted local flooding which resulted in traffic disruptions{20] the remnants of diana also dropped light rainfall in san diego county california with the city of san diego receiving only a trace of rain vista reporting 009xc2xa0in (2xc2xa0mm) del mar had 008xc2xa0in (2xc2xa0mm) and oceanside measuring 03xc2xa0in (8xc2xa0mm){21]in arizona the remnants of diana contributed to record cold temperatures for august in phoenix on augustxc2xa014 the city had a high temperature of 78xc2xa0xc2xb0f (26xc2xa0xc2xb0c) which was 24xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x924xc2xa0xc2xb0c) below normal for that date in maricopa county 35xc2xa0in (89xc2xa0mm) of rain was observed heavy precipitation with 342xc2xa0in (87xc2xa0mm) in desert hills which fell in less than two hours several weather-related car accidents occurred but none were serious in apache junction police and city officials rushed to close flooded streets including portions of state highways and underpasses of interstate 17 crews were pumping 32000xc2xa0usxc2xa0gal (120000xc2xa0l) of water from the underpasses of interstate 17 but their efforts were futile a 19xc2xa0mi (31xc2xa0km) portion of state route 87 between gila river indian community and the intersection with state route 187 was shut down due to flooding in sacaton about two-thirds of the city was inundated with at least 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) of water{22]due to its impact the name diana was retired by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 1991 and will never be used again for another atlantic hurricane it was replaced with dolly for the 1996 season this hurricane diana is not to be confused with the 1955 season's hurricane diane which was also retired{23]see
