portalvtetropical cyclones are officially ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity indextropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern pacific ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms should a system intensify further and become a hurricane then it will be classified on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period in the western pacific the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute periodthe india meteorological department's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesiathe definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization (wmo) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10xc2xa0m (33xc2xa0ft) however the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period at 10xc2xa0m (33xc2xa0ft) above the surface the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period and the australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval these make direct comparisons between basins difficultwithin all basins

defined as being warm cored non-frontal synoptic cyclones that develop over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the world meteorological organisation's regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in; with for example the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds which are either observed measured or estimated using various techniques over a period between one and ten minutesatlantic eastern and central pacific{edit]saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalecategorywind speedsfivexe2x89xa570 ms xe2x89xa5137

scaletropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the anti-meridian are officially monitored by either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center{1] within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre{1] the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones{1] once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33xc2xa0kn (38xc2xa0mph; 62xc2xa0kmh){1] however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone{1] should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34xe2x80x9363xc2xa0kn (39xe2x80x9373xc2xa0mph; 63xe2x80x93118xc2xa0kmh) then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name{1]should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64xc2xa0kn (74xc2xa0mph; 119xc2xa0kmh) then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale{1] the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 64xe2x80x9382xc2xa0kn (74xe2x80x9395xc2xa0mph 119xe2x80x93153xc2xa0kmh){1]{2] should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2 hurricane if it has winds of between 83xe2x80x9395xc2xa0kn (96xe2x80x93110xc2xa0mph 154xe2x80x93177xc2xa0kmh){1]{2] when a system becomes a category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96xe2x80x93112xc2xa0kn (111xe2x80x93129xc2xa0mph 178xe2x80x93208xc2xa0kmh) it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers{2] a category 4 hurricane has winds of 113xe2x80x93136xc2xa0kn (130xe2x80x93156xc2xa0mph 209xe2x80x93251xc2xa0kmh) while a category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137xc2xa0kn (157xc2xa0mph 252xc2xa0kmh){1]{2] a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage{1] however advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone poses a significant threat to life and property{1] they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48xc2xa0hours{1]the sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite the scale was changed to the "saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale" (sshws) based entirely on wind speedalthough increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms depending on factors such as local terrain population density and total rainfall for instance a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large categoryxc2xa05 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region in fact tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties especially from flooding and landslideshistorically the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110xc2xa0kn (125xc2xa0mph; 200xc2xa0kmh) large radii (over 160xc2xa0km  100xc2xa0mi) and that caused large amounts of destruction this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale in the early 1970s{3]a minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012 hurricane season with the wind speeds for categories 3xe2x80x935 tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115xc2xa0kn (130xc2xa0mph; 215xc2xa0kmh){4]western pacific{edit]rsmc tokyo's

anti-meridian and 100xc2xb0e are officially monitored by the japan meteorological agency (jma rsmc tokyo){5] within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale cyclone originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation{5] the lowest classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression which has 10-minute sustained winds of less than 33xc2xa0kn (17xc2xa0ms; 38xc2xa0mph; 61xc2xa0kmh){5] should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm which has winds speeds between 33xe2x80x9347xc2xa0kn (17xe2x80x9324xc2xa0ms; 38xe2x80x9354xc2xa0mph; 61xe2x80x9387xc2xa0kmh){5] should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm which has winds speeds between 48xe2x80x9363xc2xa0kn (25xe2x80x9332xc2xa0ms; 55xe2x80x9372xc2xa0mph; 89xe2x80x93117xc2xa0kmh){5] the highest classification on the typhoon committee's scale is a typhoon which has winds speeds greater than 64xc2xa0kn (33xc2xa0ms; 74xc2xa0mph; 119xc2xa0kmh){5]the china meteorological administration the hong kong observatory (hko) pagasa and the jma all divide the typhoon category further for domestic purposes{5] the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories with a 10-minute maximum wind speed below 84xc2xa0kn (43xc2xa0ms; 97xc2xa0mph; 156xc2xa0kmh) assigned for the (strong) typhoon category a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85xe2x80x93104xc2xa0kn (44xe2x80x9354xc2xa0ms; 98xe2x80x93120xc2xa0mph; 157xe2x80x93193xc2xa0kmh) while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105xc2xa0kn (54xc2xa0ms; 121xc2xa0mph; 194xc2xa0kmh) or greater{5] the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80xc2xa0kn (41xc2xa0ms; 92xc2xa0mph; 150xc2xa0kmh) to the typhoon category a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85xe2x80x93104xc2xa0kn (44xe2x80x9354xc2xa0ms; 98xe2x80x93120xc2xa0mph; 157xe2x80x93193xc2xa0kmh) while a super typhoon has winds of 100xc2xa0kn (51xc2xa0ms; 120xc2xa0mph; 190xc2xa0kmh){5]{6] during may 2015 pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120xc2xa0kn (62xc2xa0ms; 140xc2xa0mph; 220xc2xa0kmh){7]in addition to the national meteorological services of each nation the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states government{8] these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale however the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin{9] these classifications are tropical depression tropical storm typhoon and super typhoon{9] in addition the taiwan central weather bureau has its own scale in chinese but uses the typhoon committee scale in

in the north indian ocean is a super cyclonic storm which have hurricane-force winds of above 120xc2xa0kn (138xc2xa0mph; 222xc2xa0kmh){11]historically a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings{12] other classifications historically used include: cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the beaufort scale{12] between 1924 and 1988 tropical cyclones were classified into four categories: depression deep depression cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms{12] however a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category "severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds" for tropical cyclones with wind speeds of more than 64xc2xa0kn (74xc2xa0mph; 119xc2xa0kmh){12] during 1999 the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated{12] during 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90xe2x80x93119xc2xa0kn (166xe2x80x93221xc2xa0kmh 104xe2x80x93137xc2xa0mph): an extremely severe cyclonic storm{13] the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and

that develops within the southern hemisphere between africa and 90xc2xb0e is monitored by meteo france's la reunion tropical cyclone centre (mfr rsmc la reunion){14] within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale low pressure area originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation with the average wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots (50xc2xa0kmh))a tropical disturbance is mfr's generic term for a non-frontal area of low pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation{14] the system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28xc2xa0knots (50xc2xa0kmh 32xc2xa0mph){14]a system is designated as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28xc2xa0knots (50xc2xa0kmh 32xc2xa0mph) should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35xc2xa0knots (65xc2xa0kmh 40xc2xa0mph) then it will be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the sub regional center in mauritius or madagascar no matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin it is always designated as a subtropical depression{15]should the named storm intensify further and reach winds speeds of 48xc2xa0knots (89xc2xa0kmh 55xc2xa0mph) then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm{15] a severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64xc2xa0knots (118xc2xa0kmh 74xc2xa0mph){14] should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90xc2xa0knots (166xc2xa0kmh 103xc2xa0mph) it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone{14] a very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the south-west indian ocean tropical cyclone scale and has winds of over 115xc2xa0knots (212xc2xa0kmh 132xc2xa0mph){15]at the tenth ra i tropical cyclone committee held during 1991 it was recommended that the intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993xe2x80x9394 tropical cyclone season{16] specifically it was decided that the classifications: weak tropical depression moderate tropical depression and severe tropical depression would be changed to tropical depression moderate tropical storm and severe tropical storm{16] this change was implemented ahead of the 1993xe2x80x9394 tropical cyclone season{16] the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government{8]

tropical cyclone warning centres{17] these are run by the fiji meteorological service new zealand's metservice indonesia's badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika papua new guinea's national weather service while three others are run by the australian bureau of meteorology{17] within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34xc2xa0kn (63xc2xa0kmh; 39xc2xa0mph) or greater near the centre{17] once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds{17]{18] a category 1 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34xe2x80x9347xc2xa0kn (39xe2x80x9354xc2xa0mph; 63xe2x80x9387xc2xa0kmh) while a category 2 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 48xe2x80x9363xc2xa0kn (55xe2x80x9372xc2xa0mph; 89xe2x80x93117xc2xa0kmh){18]{19] when a system becomes a category 3 tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 64xe2x80x9385xc2xa0kn (74xe2x80x9398xc2xa0mph; 119xe2x80x93157xc2xa0kmh){18]{19] a category 4 severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86xe2x80x93110 kn (99xe2x80x93130xc2xa0mph; 157xe2x80x93200xc2xa0kmh) while the maximum rating is a category 5 severe tropical cyclone which has winds of at least 110xc2xa0kn (130xc2xa0mph; 200xc2xa0kmh){18]{19]for systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical depression{17] a tropical disturbance is defined as being a nonxc2xa0xe2x80x93 frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection andor some indication of a circulation{17] a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34xc2xa0kn (39xc2xa0mph; 63xc2xa0kmh) near the centre{17] the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours{17] the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 1989xe2x80x9390 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government{8] these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones{9]alternative scales{edit]there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge; it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential{20]accumulated cyclone energy (ace) is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons{21] it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals{21] the numbers are usually divided by 10000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed{21] as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index (pdi){22]the hurricane severity index (hsi) is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields{23] the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size{23] points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields{23]comparisons across basins{edit]the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of
