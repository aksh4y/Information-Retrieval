previously the cyclone year began on augustxc2xa01 and ended on the subsequent julyxc2xa031 in 2003 the mfr extended their area of warning responsibility to 40xc2xb0xc2xa0s having previously been limited at 30xc2xb0xc2xa0s{2] during 2011 mfr started a reanalysis project of all tropical systems between 1978xe2x80x9398 with methods such as a dvorak technique reanalysis and use of microwave imagery{6] preliminary results from this reanalysis project include correcting an increasing trend in the number of very intense tropical cyclones in the basin since 1978{6] this also revealed a seemingly systematic underestimation of tropical cyclone intensities in the past{6]statistics{edit]from the 1980xe2x80x9381 to the 2010xe2x80x9311 season there was an average of 93xc2xa0tropical storms each year in the basin a tropical storm has 10xc2xa0minute winds of at least 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) there are an average of five storms that become tropical cyclones which have 10 xc2xa0minute winds of at least 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph){7] as of 2002 there was an average of 54xc2xa0days when tropical systems were active in the basin of which 20 had tropical cyclones active or a system with winds of over 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) the median start date for the season was novemberxc2xa017 and the median end date was aprilxc2xa020{1]climatology{edit]tracks of storms in the basin from 1980 to 2005generally the monsoon does not cross into the mozambique channel until december; as a result storms rarely form there before that time{1] from 1948 to 2010 94xc2xa0tropical systems developed in the small body of water of which about half made landfall{8] occasionally small storms form in the mozambique channel that resemble mediterranean tropical cyclones or storms in the northeastern atlantic ocean; these systems are well-organized but have weaker convection than typical tropical cyclones and originate over cooler than normal water temperatures of less than 26xc2xa0xc2xb0c (79xc2xa0xc2xb0f) a survey in 2004 conducted by weather expert gary padgett found meteorologists split whether these storms should be classified as tropical or subtropical{9]in an average year ten tropical depressions or storms strike madagascar and most generally do not cause much damage{10] occasionally storms or their remnants enter the interior of southeastern africa bringing heavy rainfall to zimbabwe{11]seasons{edit]list of south-west indian ocean cyclones before 19631962xe2x80x9363 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1963xe2x80x9364 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1964xe2x80x9365 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1965xe2x80x9366 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1966xe2x80x9367 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1967xe2x80x9368 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1968xe2x80x9369 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1969xe2x80x9370 south-west indian ocean cyclone season1970s{edit]seasontd'ststcitcvitcstrongeststormdeathsdamageusdnotes andreferences1970xe2x80x9319711613841maggie-muriel1971xe2x80x93197297210fabienne1972xe2x80x9319731311421lydie1973xe2x80x93197487100deidre-delinda1974xe2x80x931975106200gervaise1975xe2x80x93197686110terry-danae1976xe2x80x93197798310jack-io1977xe2x80x9319781412210aurore1978xe2x80x931979106420celine1979xe2x80x9319801111420viola-claudette1980s{edit]seasontd'ststcitcstrongeststormdeathsdamageusdnotes andreferences1980xe2x80x9381121032alice-adelaideflorine1981xe2x80x9382141052chris-damia100250xc2xa0million1982xe2x80x93836300bemanyelinah3323xc2xa0million1983xe2x80x9384141344andryannette-jaminykamisy356496xc2xa0million1984xe2x80x93859910helisaonina0unknown1985xe2x80x9386131351erinesta99150xc2xa0million1986xe2x80x938710810daodo102xc2xa0million1987xe2x80x9388111141gasitao10010xc2xa0million1988xe2x80x9389121160leon-hanitrakrissy11217xc2xa0million1989xe2x80x93909951walter-gregoara4615xc2xa0million1990s{edit]seasontd'ststcitcvitcstrongeststormdeathsdamageusdnotes andreferences1990xe2x80x9391117300bella881991xe2x80x93921411310harriet-heather21992xe2x80x93931811420edwina20{a 1]{12]1993xe2x80x93941814840geralda5581994xe2x80x93952011530marlene{13]1995xe2x80x93962111630bonita11{14]1996xe2x80x93972112530daniella3117007500000000000000xe2x99xa050xc2xa0million1997xe2x80x9398165100anacelle881998xe2x80x9399146220evrina21999-00149431hudah10737008800000000000000xe2x99xa0800xc2xa0million{15]2000s{edit]seasontd'ststcitcvitcstrongeststormdeathsdamageusdnotes andreferences2000xe2x80x9301116420ando4{a 1]{16]2001xe2x80x93021511951hary527008287180000000000xe2x99xa0287xc2xa0million{17]2002xe2x80x93031412730kalunde1697006670000000000000xe2x99xa067xc2xa0million{a 1]2003xe2x80x93041510531gafilo3967008250000000000000xe2x99xa0250xc2xa0million{18]{19]2004xe2x80x93051810432juliet253{19]2005xe2x80x9306136320carina75{20]{21]2006xe2x80x93071510760dorafavio1887008337000000000000xe2x99xa0337xc2xa0million{a 1]{21]2007xe2x80x93081513640hondo1237007380500000000000xe2x99xa0381xc2xa0million{21]2008xe2x80x93091210220fanelegael30{22]2009xe2x80x9310169541edzani40{a 1]{22]{23]2010s{edit]seasontd'ststcitcvitcstrongeststormdeathsdamageusdnotes andreferences2010-1193200bingiza34{a 1]{24]2011-121410320funso164{a 1]{24]2012-131110730felleng357007460000000000000xe2x99xa046xc2xa0million2013-141511552hellen117007892000000000000xe2x99xa0892xc2xa0million2014-151411432bansi1117007464000000000000xe2x99xa0464xc2xa0million2015-1688331fantala137006450000000000000xe2x99xa045xc2xa0million{25]2016-1775310enawo3417008136500000000000xe2x99xa0137xc2xa0millionsee also{edit]tropical cyclones portaltropical cycloneatlantic hurricane seasonpacific hurricane seasonpacific typhoon seasonnorth indian ocean tropical cyclone seasonaustralian region tropical cyclone seasonsouth pacific tropical cyclone seasonnotes{edit]^ a b c d e f g number of tropical storms includes one subtropical depression that had winds above 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph)references{edit]^ a b c "cyclone season 2001xe2x80x932002" rsmc la reunion meteo-france retrieved april 28 2013xc2xa0^ a b philippe caroff;
