western hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical stormsxc2xa0xe2x80x93 into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds to be classified as a hurricane a tropical cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least 74xc2xa0mph (33xc2xa0ms; 64xc2xa0kn; 119xc2xa0kmh) (category 1) the highest classification in the scale categoryxc2xa05 consists of storms with sustained winds exceeding 156xc2xa0mph (70xc2xa0ms; 136xc2xa0kn; 251xc2xa0kmh)the classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfallofficially the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale is used only to describe hurricanes forming in the atlantic ocean and northern pacific ocean east of the international date line other areas use different scales to label these storms which are called "cyclones" or "typhoons" depending on the areathere is some criticism of the sshs for not taking rain storm surge and other important factors into consideration but sshs defenders say that part of the goal of sshs is to be straightforward and simple to understandcontents1 history2 categories21 category 122 category 223 category 324 category 425 category 53 criticism31 "category 6"4 see also5 references6 external linkshistory{edit]the scale was developed in 1971 by civil engineer herbert saffir and meteorologist robert simpson who at the time was director of the us national hurricane center (nhc){1] the scale was introduced to the general public in 1973{2] and saw widespread use after neil frank replaced simpson at the helm of the nhc in 1974{3]the initial scale was developed by saffir a structural engineer who in 1969 went on commission for the united nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas{4] while performing the study saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane mirroring the utility of the richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes he devised a 1xe2x80x935 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures saffir gave the scale to the nhc and simpson added the effects of storm surge and floodingin 2009 the nhc made moves to eliminate pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories transforming it into a pure wind scale called the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale (experimental) {sshws]{5] the new scale became operational on may 15 2010{6] the scale excludes flood ranges storm surge estimations rainfall and location which means a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane which hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane that hits a rural area{7] the agency cited various hurricanes as reasons for removing the "scientifically inaccurate" information including hurricane katrina (2005) and hurricane ike (2008) which both had stronger than estimated storm surges and hurricane charley (2004) which had weaker than estimated storm surge{8] since removed from the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale storm surge predicting and modeling is now handled with the use of a computerized numerical model developed by the national weather service called "sea lake and overland surge from hurricanes" (slosh)in 2012 the nhc expanded the windspeed range for category 4 by 1xc2xa0mph in both directions to 130xe2x80x93156xc2xa0mph with corresponding changes in the other units (113xe2x80x93136 kn 209xe2x80x93251xc2xa0kmh) instead of 131xe2x80x93155xc2xa0mph (114xe2x80x93135 kn 210xe2x80x93249xc2xa0kmh) the nhc and the central pacific hurricane center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments and then convert to mph and kmh with a similar rounding for other reports so an intensity of 115 knots is rated category 4 but the conversion to miles per hour (1323xc2xa0mph) would round down to 130xc2xa0mph making it appear to be a category 3 storm likewise an intensity of 135 knots (155xc2xa0mph and thus category 4) is 25002xc2xa0kmh which according to the definition used before the change would be category 5 to resolve these issues the nhc had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135xc2xa0mph and 135 kn as 245xc2xa0kmh the change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130xc2xa0mph and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250xc2xa0kmh and still qualify as category 4 since the nhc had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in category 4 in each unit of measure the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years{5] the new scale became operational on may 15 2012{9]categories{edit]the scale separates hurricanes into five different categories based on wind the us national hurricane center classifies hurricanes of categoryxc2xa03 and above as major hurricanes and the joint typhoon warning center classifies typhoons of 150xc2xa0mph or greater (strong category 4 and category 5) as super typhoons (although all tropical cyclones can be very dangerous) most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization (wmo) which specifies measuring winds at a height of 33xc2xa0ft (101xc2xa0m) for 10xc2xa0minutes and then taking the average by contrast the us national weather service central pacific hurricane center and the joint typhoon warning center define sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute measured at the same 33xc2xa0ft (101xc2xa0m) height{10]{11] and that is the definition used for this scale intensity of example hurricanes is from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensitythe scale is roughly logarithmic in wind speed and the top wind speed for category "c" (c=1 to 4 as there is no upper limit for category 5) can be expressed as 83x10^(c15) miles per hour rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 xe2x80x93 except that after the change mentioned above category 4 is now widened by 1xc2xa0mph in each directionthe five categories are in order of increasing intensity:{12]category

construction public multi-story concrete parking garages and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concretecement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35xc2xa0degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters unless all of these requirements are met the absolute destruction of a structure is certain{5]the storm's flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked isolating most affected communities massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected possibly for up to several months{5]historical examples of storms that made landfall at category 5 status include: "cuba" (1924) "okeechobee" (1928) "bahamas" (1932) "cubaxe2x80x93brownsville" (1933) "labor day" (1935) janet (1955) camille (1969) edith (1971) anita (1977) david (1979) gilbert (1988) andrew (1992) dean (2007) felix (2007) irma (2017){13] and maria (2017){14] no category 5 hurricane is known to have made landfall at that strength in the eastern pacific basincriticism{edit]some scientists including kerry emanuel and lakshmi kantha have criticized the scale as being simplistic indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces{7] additionally they and others point out that the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale unlike the richter scale used to measure earthquakes is not continuous and is quantized into a small number of categories proposed replacement classifications include the hurricane intensity index which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds and the hurricane hazard index which is based on surface wind speeds the radius of maximum winds of the storm and its translational velocity{15]{16] both of these scales are continuous akin to the richter scale;{17] however neither of these scales have been used by officials"category 6"{edit]after the series of powerful storm systems of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing categoryxc2xa06 and they have suggested pegging categoryxc2xa06 to storms with winds greater than 174 or 180xc2xa0mph (78 or 80xc2xa0ms; 151 or 156xc2xa0kn; 280 or 290xc2xa0kmh){7]{18] only a few storms of this intensity have been recorded of the 33 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the atlantic 18 had wind speeds at 175xc2xa0mph (78xc2xa0ms; 152xc2xa0kn; 282xc2xa0kmh) or greater and only seven had wind speeds at 180xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0ms; 160xc2xa0kn; 290xc2xa0kmh) or greater (the 1935 labor day hurricane allen gilbert mitch rita wilma and irma) of the 15 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the eastern pacific only five had wind speeds at 175xc2xa0mph (78xc2xa0ms; 152xc2xa0kn; 282xc2xa0kmh) or greater (patsy john linda rick and patricia) and only three had wind speeds at 180xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0ms; 160xc2xa0kn; 290xc2xa0kmh) or greater (linda rick and patricia) however most storms which would be eligible for this category were typhoons in the western pacific most notably typhoon tip in 1979 with sustained winds of 190xc2xa0mph (310xc2xa0kmh) and typhoons haiyan and meranti in 2013 and 2016 respectively with sustained winds of 195xc2xa0mph (314xc2xa0kmh){19]according to robert simpson there are no reasons for a categoryxc2xa06 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures simpson stated that "when you get up into winds in excess of 155xc2xa0mph (249xc2xa0kmh) you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered"{3] despite his statements the counties of broward and miami-dade in florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand categoryxc2xa05 winds{20] which contradicts mr simpson's assessment of building strengthsee also{edit]tropical cyclones portalbeaufort scalexc2xa0xe2x80x93 relates wind speed to observable conditions
