a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists{1]{2]starting in the 1950s up to 2002 astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronautcontents1 definition2

longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent 879 days in space{10] peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days{11]terminologysee also: astronaut ranks and positionsin 1959 when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred "cosmonaut" on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos (near space) while the "astro" prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred "astronaut" which survived by common usage as the preferred american term{12] when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to "cosmonaut"englishin english-speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut{13] the term derives from the greek words xc3xa1stron (xe1xbcx84xcfx83xcfx84xcfx81xcexbfxcexbd) meaning "star" and nautes (xcexbdxcexb1xcfx8dxcfx84xcexb7xcfx82) meaning "sailor" the first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story "the death's head meteor" in 1930 the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy greg's 1880 book across the zodiac "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de l'infini (1925) of j-h rosny axc3xaenxc3xa9 the word astronautique (astronautic) was used the word may have been inspired by "aeronaut" an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to balloonists an early use in a non-fiction publication is eric frank russell's poem "the astronaut" in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society{14]the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year{15]nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps{16] the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps{17]russianmain article: soviet space programsee also: list of cosmonautsby convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency (or its soviet predecessor) is called a cosmonaut in english texts{16] the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt (russian: xd0xbaxd0xbexd1x81xd0xbcxd0xbexd0xbdxd0xb0xd0xb2xd1x82 russian pronunciation:xc2xa0{kxc9x99smxc9x90xcbx88naft]) one who works in space outside the earth's atmosphere a space traveler{18] which derives from the greek words kosmos (xcexbaxcfx8cxcfx83xcexbcxcexbfxcfx82) meaning "universe" and nautes (xcexbdxcexb1xcfx8dxcfx84xcexb7xcfx82) meaning "sailor" other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonautacoinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov (1900xe2x80x931974){19]{20] the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first "american

is used for astronauts and cosmonauts and "hxc3xa1ng tixc4x81n yuxc3xa1n" (xe8x88xaaxe5xa4xa9xe5x91x98 "space navigating personnel") is used for chinese astronauts the phrase "txc3xa0i kxc5x8dng rxc3xa9n" (xe5xa4xaaxe7xa9xbaxe4xbaxba "spaceman") is often used in hong kong and taiwan{23]the term taikonaut is used by some english-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china{24] the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as "a hybrid of the chinese term taikong (space) and the greek naut (sailor)"; the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft{25] this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese people's daily since the advent of the chinese space program{26] the origin of the term is unclear; as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih (xe8xb6x99xe8xa3xa1xe6x98xb1) from malaysia used it in newsgroups{27]{28]other termswith the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term "spaceflight participant" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencieswhile no nation other than the russian federation (and previously the former soviet union) the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut (french spelling: spationaute) is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for "space" the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation hope to launch a spacecraft in 2018 that would carry vyomanauts coined from the

first civilian in space was valentina tereshkova{46] aboard vostok 6 (she also became the first woman in space on that mission) tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussr's air force which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time a month later joseph albert walker became the first american civilian in space when his x-15 flight 90 crossed the 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles) line qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight{47]{48] walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight the first people in space who had never been a

astronauts were selected for training in 1959{55] early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter (of the mercury seven) had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots{56]{57] the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilotsonce selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasa's neutral buoyancy laboratory{1]{56] astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the "vomit comet" the nickname given to a pair of modified kc-135s (retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c-9) which perform parabolic flights{55] astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in t-38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are done out of edwards air force basenasa

injury{66]{67]{68]{69]{70]{71]{72]{73]{74]{75] a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute (nsbri) to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts (including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare{76]{77]{78]a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space{79] more recently in 2017 bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space{80] microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space{81]{82]on december 31 2012 a nasa-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimer's
