on average only 64 events are reported per year{3]the british isles and other parts of northwestern europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or (usually wet) snow showers during winter and spring it is also common around kanazawa and the sea of japan and even around mount everest low pressure events in the eastern mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms especially over the elevated provinces of israel and jordan including amman and jerusalem when such storms happen at areas intended for skiing the mountains are often evacuated for safetyacoustic effects{edit]one unique aspect of thundersnow is that the suspended and deposited snowfall act as an acoustic suppressor of the sound of thunder the thunder from a typical thunderstorm can be heard many miles away while the thunder from thundersnow can usually only be heard within a 2xe2x80x933-mile (32xe2x80x9348xc2xa0km) radius from the lightning{citation needed]formation{edit]there are usually three causes of thundersnow:a normal thunderstorm on the leading edge of a cold front or warm front that can either form in a winter environment or that runs into cool air and where the precipitation takes the form of snowa heavy synoptic snowstorm that sustains strong vertical mixing which allows for favorable conditions for lightning and thunder to occura lake effect or ocean effect thunderstorm which is produced by cold air passing over relatively warm water; this effect commonly produces snow squalls over the great lakeslake effect precipitation{edit]a large squall producing heavy snow and frequent lightning over buffalo nylake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or shortwave aloft passes over a body of water this steepens the thermal lapse rates between the lake temperature and the temperatures aloft a difference in temperature of 25xc2xa0xc2xb0c (45xc2xa0xc2xb0f) or more between the lake temperature and the temperature at about 1500xc2xa0m (4900xc2xa0ft) (the 850 hpa level) usually marks the onset of thundersnow if surface temperatures are expected to be below freezing however several factors including other geographical elements affect the development of thundersnowthe primary factor is convective depth this is the vertical depth in the troposphere that a parcel of air will rise from the ground before it reaches the equilibrium (eql) level and stops rising a minimum depth of 1500xc2xa0m (4900xc2xa0ft) is necessary and an average depth of 3000xc2xa0m (9800xc2xa0ft) or more is generally accepted as sufficient wind shear is also a significant factor linear snow squall bands produce more thundersnow than clustered bands; thus a directional wind shear with a change of less than 12xc2xa0xc2xb0c (54xc2xa0xc2xb0f) between the ground and 2000xc2xa0m (6600xc2xa0ft) in height must be in place however any change in direction greater than 12xc2xa0xc2xb0c (54xc2xa0xc2xb0f) through that layer will tear the snow squall apart a bare minimum fetch of 50xc2xa0kmh (31xc2xa0mph) is required so that the air passing over the lake or ocean water will become sufficiently saturated with moisture and will acquire thermal energy from the waterthe last component is the echo top or storm top temperature this must be at least xe2x88x9230xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x9222xc2xa0xc2xb0f) it is generally accepted that at this temperature there is no longer any super cooled water vapor present in a cloud but just ice crystals suspended in the air this allows for the interaction of the ice cloud and graupel pellets within the storm to generate a charge resulting in lightning and thunder{4]synoptic forcing{edit]synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow the best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its northwest quadrant (in the northern hemisphere based on observations in the midwestern united states) within what is known as the "comma head" of a mature extratropical cyclone{5]{6] thundersnow can also be located underneath the trowal a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone{7] in extreme cases thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front{6] the 1991 halloween blizzard superstorm of 1993 and white juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnowupslope flow{edit]similar to the lake effect regime thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone when a shortwave aloft moves into the region the shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing and occasionally thundersnow{8]hazards{edit]thundersnow produces heavy snowfall rates in the range of 5 to 10xc2xa0cm (2 to 4xc2xa0in) per hour snowfall of this intensity may limit visibilities severely even during light wind conditions however thundersnow is often a part of a severe winter storm or blizzard winds of above tropical storm force are frequent with thundersnow as a result visibilities in thundersnow are frequently under 400xc2xa0m (1xe2x81x844xc2xa0mi) additionally such wind creates extreme wind chills and may result in frostbite finally there is a greater likelihood that thundersnow lightning will have a positive polarity which has greater destructive potential than negatively charged (typical) lightning{9]see also{edit]blizzard warningsevere thunderstorm warningsevere weather terminology (united states)references{edit]^ dauna coulter nasa {1] retrieved on 12-20-2012^ christine dell'amore national geographic news^ patrick s market chris e halcomb and rebecca l ebert a climatology of thundersnow events over the contiguous united states retrieved on 01-11-2006^ usa today jack williams warm water helps create great lakes snowstorms retrieved on 01-11-2006^ patrick s market angela m oravetz david gaede evan bookbinder rebecca ebert and christopher melick upper air constant pressure composites of midwestern thundersnow events retrieved on 01-11-2006^ a b rauber rm;
