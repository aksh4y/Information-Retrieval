which definitely shows off the band's barbados roots and another slightly more upbeat track 'headphones' which emphasises the band's musical ability and raw talent with lyrics such as 'boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat' it's easy to compare amanda to fellow bajan beauty rihanna - however this band definitely have their own sound and the album has some sure fire catchy hits!"{11]krystal scanlon of gigwise gave the album a positive review commenting "cover drivexe2x80x99s first three singles have already scored barbadian band huge hit singles so it was obvious the band have already got their career off to a good start" she continued saying "the opening track 'bajan style intro' is just a perfect taster of what the album has to offer with a hint of an early black eyed peas tone to some of their songs this album offers its listeners a variety of solid beats catchy lyrics and an overall good feeling the background beat of 'headphones' holds a similar style of tune to no doubt's "hey baby" xe2x80x93 so if youxe2x80x99re a fan of the lovely gwen stefani this is definitely worth a try 'lick ya down' rivals rihanna for the radio-friendly sounds heard on her recent album but that said cover drive still have their own unique style and this song is equally catchy just like the rest of this album with their front girl amanda being labeled the new bajan queen of the music scene rihanna is definitely going to have a little competition on her hands in the charts 'wrongside' is another standout tune and has a vibe similar to shaggyxe2x80x99s 'it wasn't me' with the backing rhythm while a lot of these songs do have a catchy beat and could be considered similar itxe2x80x99s safe to say there is still a lot of variety amongst the songs xe2x80x93 from calmer slow songs to upbeat songs that make you want to dance cover drive are definitely some way from their pop peak on this their first album but therexe2x80x99s no doubt that this is going to set the bar high itxe2x80x99ll be interesting to see what song they release next because they certainly have a good set to choose from"{12]lewis corner of digital spy awarded the album three out of five stars commenting "from the off it's clear the group have been influenced by other mixed quartets no doubt and the black eyed peas as such singer amanda reifer serves as the fergiegwen stefani and takes the lead on the majority of the tracks she can flip from butter-wouldn't-melt on mid-tempo love song 'twilight' to passionate and sassy on debut single 'lick ya down' in an instant - and she pulls it off with ease however it's 'headphones' that showcases the band's real ability as musicians "boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat" amanda swoons over bouncy beats and funk-driven guitar riffs packed with more tropical flavour and sweetness than an ice-cold can of lilt 'sparks' proves they are more than capable of taking on the trickier ballads producing an ear-snagging pop melody with a floating piano riff and radio-friendly vocals penultimate cut 'hurricane' injects a welcome burst of back-end energy after non-starters 'wrongside' and 'can't live in a world' begin to pull things down like all good cricket matches there may be quiet spells during the game but it's only the final result that really matters luckily for cover drive their very first innings contains some very memorable hits"{13]alex macpherson of the guardian awarded the album three out of five stars saying "the summer dancehall hit once an annual staple of the british charts has been on a hiatus in recent years xe2x80x93 as bajan four-piece cover drive have spotted their compatriot rihanna may have long abandoned reggae-lite pop for foghorn electro but her early years provide fertile inspiration for cover drive from the steel pans and airhorns of breakthrough hit 'lick ya down' to the fluttering yearning 'explode' lead singer amanda reifer could be mistaken for rihanna albeit a less charismatic version xe2x80x93 a quality that also explains why cover drive's breezy beach party-vibes are highly likable but a bit lightweight still in an era when most pop stars' strategy is to bludgeon you into submission that's refreshing"{14]track listing{edit]notitlewriter(s)producer(s)length1"bajan style (intro)"cover drive xe2x80xa2 iyiola babalola xe2x80xa2 darren lewis xe2x80xa2 viktoria hansenfuture cut1:172"twilight"cover drive xe2x80xa2 andreas romdhane xe2x80xa2 josef larossi xe2x80xa2 ina wroldsenquiz  larossi3:273"lick ya down"cover drive xe2x80xa2 jonathan rotem xe2x80xa2 marty james xe2x80xa2 peter ringjr rotem aliby (co)3:214"headphones"cover drive xe2x80xa2 orange factory xe2x80xa2 jonathan perkins xe2x80xa2 khaled rohaimorange factory3:585"that girl"cover drive xe2x80xa2 wroldsen xe2x80xa2 steve macsteve mac2:376"sparks"cover drive xe2x80xa2 mac xe2x80xa2 wayne hectorsteve mac2:557"explode"cover drive xe2x80xa2 macsteve mac3:088"wrongside"cover drive xe2x80xa2 august rigoaugust rigo3:269"can't live in a world"cover drive xe2x80xa2 ali tamposi xe2x80xa2 dwayne chin-quee xe2x80xa2 mitchum chin xe2x80xa2 mathew samuelssupa dups3:4810"hurricane"cover drive xe2x80xa2 babalola xe2x80xa2 lewis xe2x80xa2 hansenfuture cut3:2411"i know you too well"cover drive xe2x80xa2 hector xe2x80xa2 romdhane xe2x80xa2 larossiquiz  larossi3:2612"bajan style (outro)"cover drive xe2x80xa2 babalola xe2x80xa2 lewis xe2x80xa2 hansenfuture cut0:37total length:35:29digital deluxe edition bonus tracksnotitlewriter(s)producer(s)length13"she la la lay"karen reifer armstrong harding hill sean henriques wycliffe johnson clifford ray smith cleveland constatine browne eliseus joseph julian griffithxc2xa03:0514"no breaks"hasham hussain denarius motes tiyon "tc" mack karen reifer armstrong hardingxc2xa03:0715"bajan style" (full version)babalola lewis viktoria hansen karen reifer armstrong harding hillfuture cut2:59total length:41:55digital deluxe edition bonus videosnotitlewriter(s)director(s)length16"lick ya down" (video)rotem james karen reifer armstrong harding ringsyndrome3:3517"twilight" (video)romdhane larossi wroldsen karen reifer armstrong hardingjohn d aguon and chaz wood3:3518"sparks" (video)karen reifer armstrong harding wayne hector macdeclan whitebloom3:04total length:51:29charts{edit]weekly charts{edit]chart (2012)peakpositionscottish albums chart{15]28uk albums chart{16]14irish albums chart{16]99references{edit]^ "cover drive reveal new single 'sparks' announce debut album plans" entertainmentwise archived from the original on 7 march 2012 retrieved 6 march 2012xc2xa0^ "news: we catch up with cover drive" 4music archived from the original on 1 february 2012 retrieved 25 january 2012xc2xa0^ "2011 top 40 official uk singles archive -
