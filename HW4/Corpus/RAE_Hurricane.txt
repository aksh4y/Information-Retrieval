like many others it suffered from an unreliable engine worst it was slow; it had been entered specifically for the abdullah speed prize and there had been talk of speeds near 100xc2xa0mph but the best it could do was 585xc2xa0mph (94xc2xa0kmh){7] before retiring with a broken rocker arm{8] the winner of this xc2xa3500 prize was the parnall pixie ii at 761xc2xa0mph{9]as a single seater the hurricane did not qualify for the 1924 lympne two seater light plane competition but flew in the grosvenor challenge cup immediately afterwards now powered with the cherub engine the extra power produced a speed of about 80xc2xa0mph but it failed at just past the half way stage{2]{10] its most successful meeting was at lympne in august 1925 flown by flt j f chick where it won the light plane holiday handicap the private owners race and most prestigiously the eight lap 100 mile (161xc2xa0km) grosvenor challenge cup{11] averaging 812xc2xa0mph (131xc2xa0kmh){12] in total the hurricane picked up xc2xa3300 in prizes at that meeting{4] it was flown by chick in its last grosvenor cup in 1926; although it was faster than before (848xc2xa0mph or 136xc2xa0kmh) it only managed third place{13] it was broken up later that year{4]specifications (cherub powered){edit]data from ord-hume 2000 pxc2xa0455general characteristicscrew: 1length: 17xc2xa0ft 8xc2xa0in (538xc2xa0m)wingspan: 23xc2xa0ft 0xc2xa0in (701xc2xa0m)height: 4xc2xa0ft 7xc2xa0in (140xc2xa0m)wing area: 80xc2xa0sqxc2xa0ft (74xc2xa0m2)empty weight: 350xc2xa0lb (159xc2xa0kg)gross weight: 550xc2xa0lb (249xc2xa0kg)powerplant: 1 xc3x97 bristol cherub ii flat twin 32xc2xa0hp (24xc2xa0kw)performancemaximum speed: 85xc2xa0mph (137xc2xa0kmh;
