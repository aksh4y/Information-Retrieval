distinct sovereign states: north korea (officially the "democratic people's republic of korea") and south korea (officially the "republic of korea") located on the korean peninsula korea is bordered by china to the northwest and russia to the northeast it is separated from japan to the east by the korea strait and the sea of japan (east sea)korea emerged as a singular political entity in 676ce after centuries of conflict among the three kingdoms of korea which were unified as unified silla to the south and balhae to the north unified silla divided into three separate states during the later three kingdoms period goryeo which had succeeded goguryeo defeated the two other states and united the korean peninsula around the same time balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to goryeo goryeo (also spelled as koryxc5x8f) whose name developed into the modern exonym "korea" was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234{4]{5]{6]{7]{8]{9] however multiple invasions by the mongol yuan dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting following the yuan dynasty's collapse severe political strife followed and goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by general yi seong-gye who established joseon in 1392the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty korea's isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the "hermit kingdom" by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino-japanese war despite the korean empire's effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945in 1945 the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under us occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist-inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro-western government in the south leading to korea's division into two political entities: north korea (formally the democratic people's republic of korea) and south korea (formally the republic of korea) tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each

external linksetymologymain article: names of koreasee also: korean romanization"korea" is the modern spelling of "corea" (xeaxb3xa0xebxa0xa4) a name attested in english as early as 1614{citation needed] korea was transliterated as cauli in the travels of marco polo{10] based on the kingdom of goryeo (koryxc5x8f) which ruled most of the korean peninsula during marco polo's time korea's introduction to the west resulted from trade and contact with merchants from arabic lands{11] with some records dating back as far as the 9th century{12] goryeo's name was a continuation of goguryeo (koguryxc5x8f) the northernmost of the three kingdoms of korea which was officially known as goryeo beginning in the 5th century{13] the original name was a combination of the adjective go ("high lofty") with the name of a local yemaek tribe whose original name is thought to have been either guru (xe6xbax9dxe6xa8x93 "walled city" inferred from some toponyms in chinese historical documents) or gauri (xeaxb0x80xecx9axb0xebxa6xac "center") with expanding british and american trade following the opening of korea in the late 19th century the spelling "korea" appeared and gradually grew in popularity; its use in transcribing east asian languages avoids the issues caused by the separate hard and soft cs existing in english vocabulary derived from the romance languages the name korea is now commonly used in english contexts by both north and south koreain south korea korea as a whole is referred to as hanguk (xedx95x9cxeaxb5xad {haxcbx90nxc9xa1uk] litxe2x80x89"country of the han")

written in hanja as xe9x9fx93 xe5xb9xb9 or xe5x88x8a this han has no relation to the chinese place names or peoples who used those characters but was a phonetic transcription (oc:xe2x80x89gar mcxe2x80x89han{14] or gan) of a native korean word that seems to have had the meaning "big" or "great" particularly in reference to leaders it has been tentatively linked with the title khan used by

following the fall of gojoseon but before goguryeo baekje and silla fully developed into kingdomsthis time period saw numerous states spring up from the former territories of gojoseon which encompassed northern korea and southern manchuria with the fall of gojoseon southern korea entered the samhan periodlocated in the southern part of the korean peninsula samhan refers to the three confederacies of mahan jinhan and byeonhan mahan was the largest and consisted of 54 states byeonhan and jinhan both consisted of twelve states bringing a total of 78 states within the samhan these three confederacies eventually developed into baekje silla and gayathree kingdomsmain articles: three kingdoms of korea baekje goguryeo and silla7th century tang dynasty painting of envoys from the three kingdoms of korea: baekje goguryeo and sillathe three kingdoms of korea consisted of goguryeo silla and baekje silla and baekje controlled the southern half of the korean peninsula maintaining the former samhan territories while goguryeo controlled the northern half of the korean peninsula manchuria and the liaodong peninsula uniting buyeo okjeo dongye and other states in the former gojoseon territories{17]goguryeo was a highly militaristic state;{18]{19] it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in east asia{20]{21]{22]{23] reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of manchuria to the north parts of inner mongolia to the west{24] parts of russia to the east{25] and the seoul region to the south{26] goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu{27]{28]{29]{30] who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula{31]{32] in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties{33] most notably the goguryeo-sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men{34]{35]{36]{37]{38] in 642 the powerful general yeon gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over goguryeo in response emperor tang taizong of china led a campaign against goguryeo but was defeated and retreated{39]{40] after the death of tang taizong his son emperor tang gaozong allied with the korean kingdom of silla and invaded goguryeo again but was unable to overcome goguryeo's stalwart defenses and was defeated in 662{41]{42] however yeon gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother with his eldest son defecting to tang and his younger brother defecting to silla{43]{44] the tang-silla alliance finally conquered goguryeo in 668 after the collapse of goguryeo tang and silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the korean peninsula silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the korean peninsula while tang gained control over goguryeo's northern territories however 30 years after the fall of goguryeo a goguryeo general by the name of dae joyeong founded the korean-mohe state of balhae and successfully expelled the tang presence from much of the former goguryeo territoriesseokguram grotto from the silla era a unesco world heritage sitethe southwestern korean kingdom of baekje was founded around modern-day seoul by a goguryeo prince a son of the founder of goguryeo{45]{46]{47] baekje absorbed all of the mahan states and subjugated most of the western korean peninsula (including the modern provinces of gyeonggi chungcheong and jeolla as well as parts of hwanghae and gangwon) to a centralised government; during the expansion of its territory baekje acquired chinese culture and technology through maritime contacts with the southern dynasties baekje was a great maritime power;{48] its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to japan{49]{50] historic evidence suggests that japanese culture art and language were influenced by the kingdom of baekje and korea itself;{23]{51]{52]{53]{54]{55]{56]{57]{58]{59]{60]{61] baekje also played an important role in transmitting advanced chinese culture to the japanese archipelago baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula most notably in the 4th century during the rule of geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to liaoxi and shandong in china taking advantage of the weakened state of former qin and kyushu in the japanese archipelago;{62] however baekje was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined{63]although later records claim that silla was the oldest of the three kingdoms of korea it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop by the 2nd century silla existed as a large state in the southeast occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states in 562 silla annexed the gaya confederacy which was located between baekje and silla the three kingdoms of korea often warred with each other and silla was often dominated by baekje and goguryeo silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage{64]{65] in 660 king muyeol ordered his armies to attack baekje general kim yu-shin aided by tang forces conquered baekje after defeating general gyebaek at the battle of hwangsanbeol in 661 silla and tang attacked goguryeo but were repelled king munmu son of muyeol and nephew of general kim yu-shin launched another campaign in 667 and goguryeo fell in the following yearnorth-south states periodmain articles: north south states period later silla and balhaebeginning in the 6th century silla's power gradually extended across the korean peninsula silla first annexed the adjacent gaya confederacy in 562 by the 640s silla formed an alliance with the tang dynasty of china to conquer baekje and later goguryeo after conquering baekje and goguryeo silla repulsed tang china from the korean peninsula in 676 even though silla unified most of the korean peninsula most of the goguryeo territories to the north of the korean peninsula were ruled by balhae former goguryeo general dae jo-yeong led a group of goguryeo and mohe refugees to the jilin and founded the kingdom of balhae 30 years after the collapse of goguryeo as the successor to goguryeo at its height balhae's territories extended from southern manchuria down to the northern korean peninsula balhae was called the "prosperous country in the east"{66]later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east asia{67] and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo; in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze river{68]{69]{70]{71] later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country{72] and its metropolitan capital of gyeongju{73] was the fourth largest city in the world{74]{75]{76]{77] later silla was a golden age of art and culture{78]{79]{80]{81] as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese buddhists{82] and contributed to chinese buddhism{83] including: woncheuk wonhyo uisang musang{84]{85]{86]{87] and kim gyo-gak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese buddhism{88]{89]{90]{91]{92]later silla fell apart in the late 9th century giving way to the tumultuous later three kingdoms period (892xe2x80x93935) and balhae was destroyed by the khitans in 926 goryeo unified the later three kingdoms and received the last crown prince and much of the ruling class of balhae thus bringing about a unification of the two successor nations of goguryeo{93]goryeo dynastymain article: goryeogoryeo was founded in 918 and replaced silla as the ruling dynasty of korea goryeo's land was at first what is now south korea and about 13 of north korea but later on managed to recover most of the korean peninsula momentarily goryeo advanced to parts of jiandao while conquering the jurchens but returned the territories due to the harsh climate and difficulties in defending them the name "goryeo" (xe9xabx98xe9xbax97) is a short form of "goguryeo" (xe9xabx98xe5x8fxa5xe9xbax97) and was first used during the time of king jangsu goryeo regarded itself as the successor of goguryeo hence its name and efforts to recover the former territories of goguryeo{94]{95]{96]{97] wang geon the founder of goryeo was of goguryeo descent{98] and traced his ancestry to a noble goguryeo clan{99] he made kaesong his hometown the capitalduring this period laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula the development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries the publication of the tripitaka koreana onto more than 80000 wooden blocks and the invention of the world's first metal movable type in the 13th century attest to goryeo's cultural achievements{4]{5]{6]{7]{8]{9]goryeo had to defend frequently against attacks by nomadic empires especially the khitans and the mongols goryeo had a hostile relationship with the khitans because the khitan empire had destroyed balhae also a successor state of goguryeo in 993 the khitans who had established the liao dynasty in 907 invaded goryeo demanding that it make amity with them goryeo sent the diplomat seo hui to negotiate who successfully persuaded the khitans to let goryeo expand to the banks of the amnok river citing that in the past the land belonged to goguryeo the predecessor of goryeo{100] during the goryeoxe2x80x93khitan war the khitan empire invaded korea twice more in 1009 and 1018 but was defeatedafter defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time{101]{102] goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science; by 1100 there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists{103]{104]goryeo was invaded by the mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s but was never conquered{105] exhausted after decades of fighting goryeo sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to the mongols; kublai khan accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince{105] and the dynastic line of goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the mongol yuan dynasty as a semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally the two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses{105] and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess{106]in the 1350s king gongmin was free at last to reform the goryeo government when the yuan dynasty began to crumble gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with which included the removal of pro-mongol aristocrats and military officials the question of land holding and quelling the growing animosity between the buddhists and confucian scholars during this tumultuous period goryeo momentarily conquered liaoyang in 1356 repulsed two large invasions by the red turbans in 1359 and 1360 and defeated the final attempt by the yuan to dominate goryeo when general choe yeong defeated a mongol tumen in 1364 during the 1380s goryeo turned its attention to the wokou threat and used naval artillery created by choe museon to annihilate hundreds of pirate shipsjoseon dynastymain article: joseonthe gyeongbokgung palacekorean plated mailin 1392 the general yi seong-gye overthrew the goryeo dynasty after he staged a coup and defeated general choe yeong yi seong-gye named his new dynasty joseon and moved the capital from kaesong to hanseong (formerly hanyang; modern-day seoul) and built the gyeongbokgung palace{107] in 1394 he adopted confucianism as the country's official ideology resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the buddhists the prevailing philosophy of the joseon dynasty was neo-confucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrityjoseon was a nominal tributary state of china but exercised full sovereignty{108]{109] and maintained the highest position among china's tributary states{110]{111] which also included countries such as the ryukyu kingdom vietnam thailand{112]{113]{114] the philippines burma laos among others{115]{116] in addition joseon received tribute from jurchens and japanese until the 17th century{117]{118]{119] and had a small enclave in the ryukyu kingdom that engaged in trade with siam and java{120]during the 15th and 16th centuries joseon enjoyed many benevolent rulers who promoted education and science{121] most notable among them was sejong the great (r 1418xe2x80x9350) who promulgated hangul the korean alphabet this golden age{121] saw great cultural and scientific advancements{122] including in printing meteorological observation astronomy calendar science ceramics military technology geography cartography medicine and agricultural technology some of which were unrivaled elsewhere{123] joseon implemented a class system that consisted of yangban the noble class jungin the middle class yangin the common class and cheonin the lowest class which included occupations such as butchers tanners shamans entertainers and nobi the equivalent of slaves bondservants or serfs{124]{125]in 1592 and again in 1597 the japanese invaded korea; the korean military at the time was unprepared and untrained due to two centuries of peace on the korean peninsula{126] toyotomi hideyoshi intended to conquer china and india{127] through the korean peninsula but was defeated by strong resistance from the righteous army the naval superiority of admiral yi sun-sin and his turtle ships and assistance from wanli emperor of ming china however joseon experienced great destruction including a tremendous loss of cultural sites such as temples and palaces to japanese pillaging and the japanese brought back to japan an estimated 100000xe2x80x93200000 noses cut from korean victims{128] less than 30 years after the japanese invasions the manchus took advantage of joseon's war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637 and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynastyafter normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century{129]{130]in the 19th century the royal in-law families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname "the hermit kingdom" but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders beginning an era leading into japanese imperial rulekorean empiremain article: korean empirethe earliest surviving depiction of the korean flag was printed in a us navy

myeongseong of korea was assassinated by japanese agents{131]in 1897 the joseon dynasty proclaimed the korean empire (1897xe2x80x931910) king gojong became an emperor during this brief period korea

legal or illegal due to its signing under duress threat of force and bribeskorean resistance to the brutal japanese occupation{133]{134]{135] was manifested in the nonviolent march 1st movement of 1919 during which 7000 demonstrators were killed by japanese police and military{136] the korean liberation movement also spread to neighbouring manchuria and siberiaover five million koreans were conscripted for labour beginning in 1939{137] and tens of thousands of men were forced into japan's military{138] nearly 400000 korean labourers died{139] approximately 200000 girls and women{140] mostly from china and korea were forced into sexual slavery for the japanese military{141] in 1993 japanese chief cabinet secretary yohei kono acknowledged the terrible injustices faced by these euphemistically named "comfort women"{142]{143]during the japanese annexation the korean language was suppressed in an effort to eradicate korean national identity koreans were forced to take japanese surnames known as sxc5x8dshi-kaimei{144] traditional korean culture suffered heavy losses as numerous korean cultural artifacts were destroyed{145] or taken to japan{146] to this day valuable korean artifacts can often be found in japanese museums or among private collections{147] one investigation by the south korean government identified 75311 cultural assets that were taken from korea 34369 in
