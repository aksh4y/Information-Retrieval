landfall on the hurricane severity index{1] the third named storm and first categoryxc2xa05 hurricane of the 1961 atlantic hurricane season carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern caribbean sea on septemberxc2xa03 initially a tropical depression it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward and by septemberxc2xa05 the system was upgraded to tropical storm carla about 24xc2xa0hours later carla was upgraded to a hurricane shortly thereafter the storm curved northward while approaching the yucatxc3xa1n channel late on septemberxc2xa07 carla entered the gulf of mexico while passing just northeast of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula by early on the following day the storm became a major hurricane after reaching categoryxc2xa03 intensity resuming its northwestward course carla continued intensification and on septemberxc2xa011 it was upgraded to a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane later that day carla weakened slightly but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near port o'connor texas it weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on septemberxc2xa012 heading generally northward carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on septemberxc2xa013 while centered over southern oklahoma rapidly moving northeastward carla's remnants reached the labrador sea canada and dissipated on septemberxc2xa017xc2xa01961while crossing the yucatxc3xa1n channel the outer bands of carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western cuba and the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula though no damage or fatalities were reported although initially considered a significant threat to florida the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation reaching no more than 315xc2xa0in (80xc2xa0mm) in texas wind gusts as high as 170xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) were observed in port lavaca additionally several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts with the most destructive twister an f4 near galveston texas resulting in 200xc2xa0buildings severely damaged of which at least 60xc2xa0were destroyed and 8xc2xa0deaths and 55xc2xa0injuries the aforementioned tornado remains the strongest hurricane-spawned tornado ever recorded with wind speeds in the tornado nearly 50 greater than carla's peak intensity throughout the state carla destroyed 1915xc2xa0homes 568xc2xa0farm buildings and 415xc2xa0other buildings additionally 50723xc2xa0homes 5620xc2xa0farm buildings and 10487xc2xa0other buildings suffered damage there were 34xc2xa0fatalities and at least 300xc2xa0million (1961xc2xa0usd) in losses in texas alone several tornadoes also touched down in louisiana causing the destruction of 140xc2xa0homes and 11xc2xa0farms and other buildings and major damage to 231xc2xa0additional homes and 11xc2xa0farm and other buildings minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748xc2xa0homes and 75xc2xa0farm and other buildings six deaths and 25xc2xa0million in losses in louisiana were attributed to carla heavy rainfall occurred in several other states especially in kansas where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned 5xc2xa0people overall carla resulted in 32574xc2xa0million in losses and 43xc2xa0fatalities there were apparently 100 more undocumented deathscontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31

track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleas early as septemberxc2xa01 a tropical disturbance xe2x80x93 an area of convective activity xe2x80x93 was observed tracking westward across the caribbean sea within the intertropical convergence zone (itcz) around that time an anticyclone was situated over the western caribbean sea at the upper-tropospheric levels surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on septemberxc2xa03{2] thus it is estimated that a tropical depression xe2x80x93 a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39xc2xa0mph (63xc2xa0kmh) xe2x80x93 developed about 175 miles (282xc2xa0km) northwest of barranquilla colombia at 1200xc2xa0utc{3] initially the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data at san andrxc3xa9s winds shifted west at about 12xc2xa0mph (19xc2xa0kmh) while barometric pressures dropped to 1007xc2xa0mbar (297xc2xa0inhg) the weather bureau office in miami florida issued its first bulletin at 1600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa04 while the depression was centered about 250 miles (400xc2xa0km) east-southeast of cabo gracias a dios nicaragua{2]it is estimated that sustained winds reached 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) at 1200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa05{4] thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named carla while located just northeast of cabo gracias a dios{3] a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that carla was continuing to intensify with surface winds of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone with convective bands extending about 520 miles (840xc2xa0km) outward from the center around 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa06 carla passed near swan island which reported a barometric pressure of about 995xc2xa0mbar (294xc2xa0inhg) and wind gusts of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) from the southwest{4] based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa06 xe2x80x93 namely a barometric pressure of 982xc2xa0mbar (290xc2xa0inhg) xe2x80x93 a bulletin issued by the weather bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had "probably reached hurricane intensity"{5] according to post-season analysis carla reached hurricane status at that time{3]radar image of carla from wsr-57 in galveston texasshortly after becoming a hurricane on septemberxc2xa06 carla curved northward in the northwestern caribbean sea at 1200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa07 the storm intensified into a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane while located east-northeast of cozumel quintana roo mexico (actual use of the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale which was developed in 1971 was not in effect) shortly thereafter carla crossed the yucatxc3xa1n channel and entered the gulf of mexico a strong high pressure area forced carla to resume its original northwesterly course early on septemberxc2xa08 the storm strengthened into a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane while located just north of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula thus carla was the third major hurricane of the season carla was upgraded to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane early on septemberxc2xa010 while approaching the gulf coast of the united states at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa011 carla strengthened into a categoryxc2xa05 while located in the northwestern gulf of mexico six hours later the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh){3]although it weakened back to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane late on septemberxc2xa011 carla reached its minimum barometric pressure of 931xc2xa0mbar (275xc2xa0inhg) later that day the storm struck matagorda island texas (seven miles south of port o'connor) with winds of 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) carla rapidly weakened inland and degenerated to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on septemberxc2xa012 while passing just east of port lavaca six hours later the storm was downgraded to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane near shiner shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm between taylor and coupland beginning late on septemberxc2xa012 the storm curved just east of due north after reaching oklahoma early on septemberxc2xa013 carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located over rural johnston county the extratropical remnants of carla moved rapidly northeastward and brought heavy rainfall to some areas of the great plains and midwestern united states by septemberxc2xa014 it entered canada near sault ste marie ontario it then continued swiftly northeastward across ontario quebec and labrador before the remnants dissipated over the labrador sea on septemberxc2xa017{3]preparations{edit]occurring a year after hurricane donna officials in the florida keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm the united states navy flew their planes out of key west while coast guardsmen evacuated alligator reef light american shoal light and sombrero key light ships docked at key west sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls on the morning of septemberxc2xa07 a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of louisiana eastward to apalachicola florida{6] on septemberxc2xa08 a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from vermilion bay westward{7] it was later extended westward to include the entire coast of texas and eastward to apalachicola florida{8] a portion of the hurricane watch from aransas pass texas to grand isle louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa09{9] an estimated 500000xc2xa0people fled the coasts of texas and louisiana making it the largest evacuation in the history of the united states at the time{10] further at least half of those people were from texas in small towns along the coast of texas 90xe2x80x93100 of their populations evacuated while 20 of people left the larger cities many in galveston stayed due to protection from the galveston seawall{11]impact{edit]carla spawned the largest hurricane-related tornado outbreak on record at the time when 26xc2xa0tornadoes touched down within its circulation however it was overwhelmingly surpassed by hurricane beulah in 1967 which spawned at least 115xc2xa0tornadoes{12] throughout its path 43xc2xa0fatalities and about 32574xc2xa0million in damage were attributed to carla most of the impact occurred in texas where the storm made landfall as a large and strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{13]{14]{15]united states{edit]most severe landfalling atlantic hurricanes in the united

twoxc2xa0houses and threexc2xa0garages{13]sign showing the highest water level of hurricane carla in galvestonthen little-known newsman dan rather reported live from the second floor of a building in texas city during the storm an act that would be imitated by later reporters this marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane rather also alerted the public of the size of carla in a way that "literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes" according to a fellow reporter broadcasting live at the weather bureau office in galveston rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the gulf of mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic he then held the map over the black and white radar screen which put the size of carla into perspective saying that carla was the size of the gulf of mexico cbs was so impressed with rather's work that he was offered the position of correspondent{18] throughout texas carla destroyed 1915xc2xa0homes 568xc2xa0farm buildings and 415xc2xa0other

to roofs glass and downed tree limbs winds caused a local river to reach 1 foot (030xc2xa0m) above flood stage{21] the 11xc2xa0tornadoes spawned by carla in louisiana destroyed 140xc2xa0homes and 11xc2xa0farm and other buildings while causing major damage to 231xc2xa0additional homes and 11xc2xa0farm and other buildings additionally 748xc2xa0homes and 75xc2xa0farm and other buildings suffered

30 and 55xc2xa0mph (48 and 89xc2xa0kmh) and gusts up to 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) were recorded in oklahoma winds injured two people due to airborne debris winds and rain combined severely disrupted electrical and telephone services and caused 670000xc2xa0in damage with 600000xc2xa0to property and 70000xc2xa0to crops{14]illinois{edit]the storm dropped precipitation amounts of 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm) throughout northwestern illinois with a peak of 818 inches (208xc2xa0mm) in mount carroll thus carla is the second-wettest tropical cyclone in illinois behind only hurricane audrey in 1957{22] additionally up to 629 inches (160xc2xa0mm) fell in 24xc2xa0hours severe local flooding occurred especially in the northern portions of the state heavy property and agricultural damage

flooded about 60xc2xa0viaducts and 1000xc2xa0basements after the chicago river rose 5 feet (15xc2xa0m) the lock gate to lake michigan was opened to release excess water however the abrupt onrush of water resulted in about 75000xc2xa0in damage to boats at wilmette harbor{13]{15]elsewhere in the united states{edit]winds in key west reached 30xc2xa0mph (48xc2xa0kmh) while much of florida reported rainfall from the outer bands of carla{23] in kansas 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180xc2xa0mm) of rain in only 6xc2xa0hours caused flash flooding with a peak amount of 852 inches (216xc2xa0mm) in haddam carla was the rainiest tropical cyclone in kansas until being surpassed by hurricane paine in 1986 and tropical storm frances in 1998{22] severe crop damage occurred especially in areas of chautauqua and shawnee counties and to the south of the kansas river many highways were left impassable due to water inundation a family of 4xc2xa0drowned after their car was swept off a road near waverly a fifth fatality occurred after a car with one occupant was swept into a tributary of the marmaton river near fort scott the storm persistently produced winds of 35 to 50xc2xa0mph (56 to 80xc2xa0kmh) causing further agricultural damage{13]in nebraska rainfall peaked at 568 inches (144xc2xa0mm) in hubbrell making carla the rainiest tropical cyclone in the state{22] heavy precipitation also fell in missouri especially in brookfield lee's summit and pleasant hill the maximum rainfall total in missouri was 934 inches (237xc2xa0mm) in concordia{22] one fatality was reported in missouri though the cause of death is unknown rainfall in iowa peaked at 903 inches (229xc2xa0mm) near chariton making carla the rainiest tropical cyclone in the state{22] up to 8 inches (200xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in a 12-hour period in the lower peninsula of michigan mostly between cheboygan and grand rapids{13] however the weather prediction center indicated precipitation amounts of 607 inches (154xc2xa0mm) in boyne falls regardless carla is the wettest tropical cyclone in the history of michigan{22] despite the rainfall flooding in michigan was relatively minimal limited to an washed out dam in traverse city{13] precipitation in wisconsin reached 758 inches (193xc2xa0mm) in brodhead causing carla to rank as the wettest tropical cyclone in the state{22] precipitation peaks in other states include 444 inches (113xc2xa0mm) in alabama 548 inches (139xc2xa0mm) in arkansas 637 inches (162xc2xa0mm) in mississippi{24] and 36 inches (91xc2xa0mm) in indiana{22]elsewhere{edit]in cuba broadcasts reported

60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) the remnants of carla brought tropical storm force winds to some areas of canada in ontario gusty winds caused power outages in the clarksonxe2x80x93port credit area electrical services were are disrupted in new brunswick due to winds up to 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) in saint john winds of 57xc2xa0mph (92xc2xa0kmh) lashed halifax in nova scotia thus the halifax public gardens closed for threat of falling trees and branches{25]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesshortly after the storm vice president lyndon b johnson a lifelong resident of texas toured the devastation in the state and met with officials from 18xc2xa0different counties remarking that "as always texans are arising to a challenge we have suffered hurricane tornado and floods but we in texas are a bold and brave people"{26] after his report to president john f kennedy and congress 55xc2xa0million was approved in aid for texas though kennedy later requested an additional 65xc2xa0million{27] president kennedy issued a disaster declaration for texas allowing all jurisdictions in the state to apply for public assistance{28] the president also declared 6 parishes in louisiana a disaster area{27] helicopters deployed 88xc2xa0united states marines to galveston to patrol devastated areas a united states navy task force composed of medical and construction work teams was also sent to the area members of the united states national guard assisted refugees in returning to their homes and worked to prevent looting{29] owing the hurricane's intensity and destruction the name carla was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced by carol in the 1965 season{30]see also{edit]tropical cyclones
