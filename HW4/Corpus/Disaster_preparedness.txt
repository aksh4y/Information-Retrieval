effects of all hazards including disasters often interchanged with disaster management it is not be confused with it the world health organization defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster thus emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a

planning should aim to prevent emergencies from occurring and failing that should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies as time goes on and more data becomes available usually through the study of emergencies as they occur a plan should evolve the development of emergency plans is a cyclical process common to many risk management disciplines such as business continuity and security risk management as set out below:recognition or identification of risksranking or evaluation of risksresponding to significant riskstoleratetreattransferterminateresourcing controls and planningreaction planningreporting  monitoring risk performancereviewing the risk management frameworkthere are a number of guidelines and publications regarding emergency planning published by various professional organizations such as asis national fire protection association (nfpa) and the international association of emergency managers (iaem) there are very few emergency management specific standards and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standardsin order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks hopefully to reduce their probability of occurring in the event that an emergency does occur managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations post-incident it is essential for an organisation to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activatedimplementation ideals{edit]this section does not cite

process to anticipate assess prevent prepare respond and recover from an incident{2]pre-incident training and testing{edit]a team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving anthraxemergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs training plans should include internal people contractors and civil protection partners and should state the nature and frequency of training and testingtesting of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly in instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space joint emergency plans formally agreed to by all parties should be put into placedrills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency and people who will be affected drills are held to prepare for the hazards of fires tornadoes lockdown for protection earthquakes etccommunicating and incident assessment{edit]communication is one of the key issues during any emergency pre-planning of communications is critical miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarilyonce an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken following assessment the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan the steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible the critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalizedthe communication policy must be well known and rehearsed and all targeted audiences or publics and individuals must be alert all communication infrastructure must be as prepared as possible with all information on groupings clearly identifiedphases and personal activities{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may

{edit]it focuses on preventing the human hazard primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels designed to provide permanent protection from disasters also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans environmental planning and design standards in january 2005 167 governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the hyogo framework{citation needed]preventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery public safety canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach in 2009 federalprovincialterritorial ministers endorsed a national disaster mitigation strategymitigation strategy{edit]disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurspreventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters in earthquake prone areas these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an earthquake valve to instantly shut off the natural gas supply seismic retrofits of property and the securing of items inside a building the latter may include the mounting of furniture refrigerators water heaters and breakables to the walls and the addition of cabinet latches in flood prone areas houses can be built on polesstilts in areas prone to prolonged electricity black-outs installation of a generator ensures continuation of electrical service the construction of storm cellars and fallout shelters are further examples of personal mitigative actionson a national level governments might implement large scale mitigation measures after the monsoon floods of 2010 the punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages comprising 1885 single-storey homes together with schools and health centres{3]one of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the red river floodway the building of the floodway was a joint provincialfederal undertaking to protect the city of winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the red river basin it cost 627 million to build in the 1960s since then the floodway has been used over 20 times its use during the 1997 red river flood alone saved an estimated 45 billion in costs from potential damage to the city{4] the floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincialfederal initiativepreparedness{edit]an airport emergency preparedness exercisepreparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a disaster occurs this equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an emergency the federal emergency management agency (fema) has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process{5] this circular overlapping model has been modified by other agencies taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers{6]fema also operates a building science branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property{7] fema advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted fema has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat (mre's) to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implementedsome guidelines for household preparedness have been put online by the state of colorado on the topics of water food tools and so on{8]emergency preparedness can be difficult to measure{9] cdc focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of its public health efforts through a variety of measurement and assessment programs{10]local emergency planning committees{edit]local emergency planning committees (lepcs) are required by the united states environmental protection agency under the emergency planning and community right-to-know act to develop an emergency response plan review the plan at least annually and provide information about chemicals in the community to local citizens{11] this emergency preparedness effort focuses on hazards presented by use and storage of extremely hazardous and toxic chemicals{12] particular requirements of lepcs includeidentification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substancesdescription of emergency response procedures on and off sitedesignation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator(s) to implement the planoutline of emergency notification proceduresdescription of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releasesdescription of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for themoutline of evacuation plansa training program for emergency responders (including schedules)methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plansaccording to the epa "many lepcs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of epcra encouraging accident prevention and risk reduction and addressing homeland security in their communities" and the agency offers advice on how to evaluate the effectiveness of these committees{13]preparedness measures{edit]the image captions in this section require cleanup to comply with wikipedia guidelinesxc2xa0for trivial

2017)preparedness measures can take many forms ranging from focusing on individual people locations or incidents to broader government-based "all hazard" planning{14] there are a number of preparedness stages between "all hazard' and individual planning generally involving some combination of both mitigation and response planning business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a disaster recovery plan community- and faith-based organizations mitigation efforts promote field response teams and inter-agency planning{15]classroom response kitschool-based response teams cover everything from live shooters to gas leaks and nearby bank robberies{16] educational institutions plan for cyberattacks and windstorms{17] industry specific guidance exists for horse farms{18] boat owners{19] and morefamily preparedness for disaster is fairly unusual a 2013 survey found that only 19 of american families felt that they were "very prepared" for a disaster{20] still there are many resources available for family disaster planning the department of homeland security's readygov page includes a family emergency plan checklist{21] has a whole webpage devoted to readiness for kids complete with cartoon-style superheroes{22] and ran a thunderclap campaign in 2014{23] the center for disease control has a zombie apocalypse website{24]kitchen fire extinguisherdisasters take a variety of forms to include earthquakes tsunamis or regular structure fires that a disaster or emergency is not large scale in terms of population or acreage impacted or duration does not make it any less of a disaster for the people or area impacted and much can be learned about preparedness from so-called small disasters{25] the red cross states that it responds to nearly 70000 disasters a year the most common of which is a single family fire{26]items on shelves in basementpreparedness starts with an individual's everyday life and involves items and training that would be useful in an emergency what is useful in an emergency is often also useful in everyday life{27] from personal preparedness preparedness continues on a continuum through family preparedness community preparedness and then business non-profit and governmental preparedness some organizations blend these various levels for example the international red cross and red crescent movement has a webpage on disaster training{28] as well as offering training on basic preparedness such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid other non-profits such as team rubicon bring specific groups of people into disaster preparedness and response operations{29] fema breaks down preparedness into a pyramid with citizens on the foundational bottom on top of which rests local government state government and federal government in that order{30]non-perishable food in cabinetthe basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an emergency and there are a number of different variations of being ready based on an assessment of what sort of threats exist nonetheless there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area's specific dangers fema recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household{31] because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary fema's recommendations are not item specific but the list includes:three-day supply of non-perishable foodthree-day supply of water xe2x80x93 one gallon of water per person per dayportable battery-powered radio or television and extra batteriesflashlight and extra batteriesfirst aid kit and

supporting them samhsa has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks to include being a good listener encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines eating healthy meals getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress{33] fema has similar advice noting that "disasters can leave children feeling frightened confused and insecure" whether a child has experienced it first hand had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television{34] in the same publication fema further notes "preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster preparation helps; when people feel prepared they cope better and so do children"to help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills fema has published a booklet called the "threat and hazard identification and risk assessment guide"{35] (thira) this guide which outlines the thira process emphasizes "whole community involvement" not just governmental agencies in preparedness efforts in this guide fema breaks down hazards into three categories: natural technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance according to fema "communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur" and "communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them" to develop threat and hazard context descriptions communities should take into account the time place and conditions in which threats or hazards might occurnot all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established ngos like the red cross emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness on-line sales of items such as survival food medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage{36]one group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called doomsday preppers this subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the fema or red cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough sometimes called survivalists doomsday preppers are often preparing for the end of the world as we know it abbreviated as teotwawki with a motto some have that "the future belongs to those who prepare" this preparedness subset has its own set of murphy's rules{37] including "rule number 1: food you still don't have enough" and "rule number 26: people who thought the government would save them found out that it didn't"not all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food guns and shelters though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of maslow's hierarchy of needs the american preppers network{38] has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times these items include:books and magazinesarts and crafts paintingchildren's entertainmentcrayons and coloring booksnotebooks and writing suppliesnuts bolts screws nails etcreligious materialsporting equipment card games and board gamesposters and banners creating awarenessemergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members for many people pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well it is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning{39] cdc's disaster supply checklist for pets includes:{32]food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls and a manual can openerdepending on the pet you may need a litter box paper towels plastic trash bags grooming items andor household bleachmedications and medical records stored in a waterproof containerfirst aid kit with a pet first aid booksturdy leash harness and carrier to transport pet safely a carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably turn around and lie down your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hourspet toys and the pet's bed if you can easily take it to reduce stresscurrent photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated and to prove that they are yoursinformation on feeding schedules medical conditions behavior problems and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster careemergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the red cross{26] these mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them cdc has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event{40] after such an event the cdc through the substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa) suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry crying frequently an increase in irritability anger and frequent arguing wanting to be alone most of the time feeling anxious or fearful overwhelmed by sadness confused having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating and difficulty making decisions increased alcohol andor substance use increased physical (aches pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with "nerves"sometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a bug-out bag while fema does not actually use the term "bug out bag" calling it instead some variation of a "go kit" the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both fema and cdc though on-line discussions of what items a "bug out bag" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by fema or cdc{41] the theory behind a "bug out bag" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of emergency evacuation whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane flood or dangerous chemical release rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and fema suggests having a family emergency plan for such occasions{42] because family members may not be together when disaster strikes this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other along with the contact information fema suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home{43] family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet if family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location such as at work or school fema suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places{42] fema has a specific form in english and in spanish to help people put together these emergency plans though it lacks lines for email contact information{42]like children people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs while "disability" has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting social security benefits{44] for the purposes of emergency preparedness the red cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical medical sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations{45] depending on the particular disability specific emergency preparations might be required fema's suggestions for people with disabilities includes having copies of prescriptions charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week's supply of medication readily available link or in a "go stay kit"{46] in some instances lack of competency in english may lead to special preparation requirements and communication efforts for both individuals and responders{47]fema notes that long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an emergency power system{48] the united states department of energy states that 'homeowners business owners and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own"{49] this active role may include installing or other procuring generators that are either portable or permanently mounted and run on fuels such as propane or natural gas{50] or gasoline{51] concerns about carbon monoxide poisoning electrocution flooding fuel storage and fire lead even small property owners to consider professional installation and maintenance{48] major institutions like hospitals military bases and educational institutions often have or are considering extensive backup power systems{52] instead of or in addition to fuel-based power systems solar wind and other alternative power sources may be used{53] standalone batteries large or small are also used to provide backup charging for electrical systems and devices ranging from emergency lights to computers to cell phones{54]emergency preparedness does not stop at home or at school{55] the united states department of health and human services addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to including maintaining a safe temperature providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances{56] fema encourages all businesses to have businesses to have an emergency response plan{57] and the small business administration specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources{58]fema cautions that emergencies happen while people are travelling as well{59] and provides guidance around emergency preparedness for a range travelers to include commuters{60] commuter emergency plan and holiday travelers{61] in particular readygov has a number of emergency preparations specifically designed for people with cars{62] these preparations include having a full gas tank maintaining adequate windshield wiper fluid and other basic car maintenance tips items specific to an emergency include:jumper cables: might want to include flares or reflective triangleflashlights to include extra batteries (batteries have less power in colder weather)first aid kit to include any necessary medications baby formula and diapers if caring for small childrennon-perishable food such as canned food (be alert to liquids freezing in colder weather) and protein rich foods like nuts and energy barsmanual can openerat least 1 gallon of water per person a day for at least 3 days (be alert to hazards of frozen water and resultant container rupture)basic toolkit: pliers wrench screwdriverpet supplies: food and waterradio: battery or hand crankedfor snowy areas: cat litter or sand for better tire traction; shovel; ice scraper; warm clothes gloves hat sturdy boots jacket and an extra change of clothesblankets or sleeping bagscharged cell phone: and car chargerin addition to emergency supplies and training for various situations fema offers advice on how to mitigate disasters the agency gives instructions on how to retrofit a home to minimize hazards from a flood to include installing a backflow prevention device anchoring fuel tanks and relocating electrical panels{63]marked gas shuttoffgiven the explosive danger posed by natural gas leaks readygov states unequivocally that "it is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas" and that property owners must ensure they have any special tools needed for their particular gas hookups readygov also notes that "it is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity" cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit readygov further states that "it is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve" and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement{64]response{edit]main article: disaster responsethe response phase of an emergency may commence with search and rescue but in all cases the focus will quickly turn to fulfilling the basic humanitarian needs of the affected population this assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (lema) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself the national response framework is a united states government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local state federal and tribal levels it provides guidance on emergency support functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery processon a personal level the response can take the shape either of a shelter in place or an evacuationevacuation signin a shelter-in-place scenario a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support in an evacuation a family leaves the area by automobile or other mode of transportation taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry possibly including a tent for shelter if mechanical transportation is not available evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding a tarpaulin and a bedroll of blanketsdonations are often sought during this period especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity due to efficiencies of scale money is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided money is also the most flexible and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted some donors prefer to send gifts in kind however these items can end up creating issues rather than helping one innovation by occupy sandy volunteers is to use a donation registry where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests which remote donors can purchase directly via a web sitemedical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include lacerations burns near drowning or crush syndromerecovery{edit]the recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided the immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible during reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the propertythe most extreme home confinement scenarios include war famine and severe epidemics and may last a year or more then recovery will take place inside the home planners for these events usually buy bulk foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment and eat the food as part of normal life a simple balanced diet can be constructed from vitamin pills whole-meal wheat beans dried milk corn and cooking oil{65] vegetables fruits spices and meats both prepared and fresh-gardened are included when possibleas a profession{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may

preparedness training is provided by local state federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skillsin the past the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background currently the field has become more diverse with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field there are over 180 schools in the us with emergency management-related programs but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management{66]professional certifications such as certified emergency manager (cem){67] and certified business continuity professional (cbcp) are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field particularly in the

institute convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management this was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified the group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management below is a summary:comprehensive xe2x80x93 consider and take into

response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions it should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution{71] professional associations hold regular workshops to keep individuals up to date with tools and resources in order to minimize risk and maximize recoveryother tools{edit]in 2008 the us agency for international development created a web-based tool for estimating populations impacted by disasters called population explorer{72] the tool uses land scan population data developed by oak ridge national laboratory to distribute population at a resolution 1xc2xa0km2 for all countries in the world used by usaid's fews net project to estimate populations vulnerable and or imd by food insecurity population explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions including estimating populations impacted by floods in central america and the pacific ocean tsunami event in 2009in 2007 a checklist for veterinarians was published in the journal of the american veterinary medical association it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:absolute requirements for participation:have i chosen to participate?have i taken ics training?have i taken other required background courses?have i made arrangements with my practice to deploy?have i made arrangements with my family?incident participation:have i been invited to participate?are my skill sets a match for the mission?can i access just-in-time training to refresh skills

conceived at the world conference on disaster reduction (wcdr) in kobe hyogo japan in january 2005 as part of the hyogo framework for action (hfa) 2005xe2x80x932015 the hfa is a global plan for disaster risk reduction adopted by 168 governmentsthe key role of irp is to identify gaps in post disaster recovery and to serve as a catalyst for the development of tools and resources for recovery efforts{81]the international red cross and red crescent movement{edit]the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc) works closely with national red cross and red crescent societies in responding to emergencies many times playing a pivotal role in addition the ifrc may deploy assessment teams eg field assessment and coordination teams (fact){82] to the affected country if requested by the national society after assessing the needs emergency response units (erus){83] may be deployed to the affected country or region they are specialized in the response component of the emergency management frameworkbaptist global response{edit]baptist global response (bgr) is a disaster relief and community development organization bgr and its partners respond globally to people with critical needs worldwide whether those needs arise from chronic conditions or acute crises such as natural disasters while bgr is not an official entity of the southern baptist convention it is rooted in southern baptist life and is the international partnership of southern baptist disaster relief teams which operate primarily in the us and canada{84]united nations{edit]the united nations system rests with the resident coordinator within the affected country however in practice the un response will be coordinated by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (un-ocha) by deploying a un disaster assessment and coordination (undac) team in response to a request by the affected country's government finally un-spider designed as a networking hub to support disaster management by application of satellite technology{85]world bank{edit]since 1980 the world bank has approved more than 500 projects related to disaster management dealing with both disaster mitigation as well as reconstruction projects amounting to more than us40 billion these projects have taken place all over the world in countries such as argentina bangladesh colombia haiti india mexico turkey and vietnam{86]{86]prevention and mitigation projects include forest fire prevention measures such as early warning measures and education campaigns; early-warning systems for hurricanes; flood prevention mechanisms (eg shore protection terracing etc); and earthquake-prone construction{86] in a joint venture with columbia university under the umbrella of the provention consortium the world bank has established a global risk analysis of natural disaster hotspots{87]in june 2006 the world bank in response to the hfa established the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery (gfdrr) a partnership with other aid donors to reduce disaster losses gfdrr helps developing countries fund development projects and programs that enhance local capacities for disaster prevention and emergency preparedness{88]european union{edit]in 2001 the eu adopted community mechanism for civil protection to facilitate co-operation in the event of major emergencies requiring urgent response actions this also applies to situations where there may be an imminent threat as well{89]the heart of the mechanism is the monitoring and information center (mic) part of the european commission's directorate-general for humanitarian aid  civil protection accessible 24 hours a day it gives countries access to a one-stop-shop of civil protections available amongst all the participating states any country inside or outside the union affected by a major disaster can make an appeal for assistance through the mic it acts as a communication hub and provides useful and updated information on the actual status of an ongoing emergency{90]national organizations{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources

netherlands{edit]in the netherlands the ministry of security and justice is responsible for emergency preparedness and emergency management on a national level and operates a national crisis centre (ncc) the country is divided into 25 safety regions (veiligheidsregio) in a safety region there are four components: the regional fire department the regional department for medical care(ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc) the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management the regional dispatch operates for police fire department and the regional medical care the dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency and also facilitates in information management emergency communication and care of citizens these services are the main structure for a response to an emergency it can happen that for a specific emergency the co-operation with an other service is needed for instance the ministry of defence water board(s) or rijkswaterstaat the veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative levelall regions operate according to the coordinated regional incident management systemunited kingdom{edit]following the 2000 fuel protests and severe flooding that same year as well as the foot-and-mouth crisis in 2001 the united kingdom passed the civil contingencies act 2004 (cca) the cca defined some organisations as category 1 and 2 responders setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response it is managed by the civil contingencies secretariat through regional resilience forums and local authoritiesdisaster management training is generally conducted at the local level and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the emergency planning college diplomas undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country the institute of emergency management is a charity established in 1996 providing consulting services for the government media and commercial sectors there are a number of professional societies for emergency planners including the emergency planning society{108] and the institute of civil protection and emergency management{109]one of the largest emergency exercises in the uk was carried out on 20 may 2007 near belfast northern ireland: a simulated plane crash-landing at belfast international airport staff from five hospitals and three airports participated in the drill and almost 150 international observers assessed its effectiveness{110]united states{edit]disaster management in the united states has utilized the functional all-hazards approach for over 20 years in which managers develop processes (such as communication  warning or sheltering) rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans (eg a tornado plan) processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats with the manager looking for gaps overlaps and conflicts between processesgiven these notions emergency managers must identify contemplate and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales{111] because of geographical differences throughout the nation a variety of different threats affect communities among the states thus although similarities may exist no two emergency plans will be completely identical additionally each locale has different resources and capacities (eg budgets personnel equipment etc) for dealing with emergencies{112] each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality{113]this creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director this type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies which require the development of hazardthreat specific plans such as the development of specific h1n1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plansin the united states all disasters are initially local with local authorities with usually a police fire or ems agency taking charge many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated office of emergency management (oem) along with personnel and equipment if the event becomes overwhelming to the local government state emergency management (the primary government structure of the united states) becomes the controlling emergency management agency federal emergency management agency (fema) part of the department of homeland security (dhs) is the lead federal agency for emergency management the united states and its territories are broken down into ten regions for fema's emergency management purposes fema supports but does not override state authoritythe citizen corps is an organization of volunteer service programs administered locally and coordinated nationally by dhs which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education training and outreach most disaster response is carried out by volunteer organizations in the us the red cross is chartered by congress to coordinate disaster response services it is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees religious organizations with their ability to provide volunteers quickly are usually integral during the response process the largest being the salvation army{114] with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding and southern baptists who focus on food preparation and distribution{115] as well as cleaning up after floods and fires chaplaincy mobile shower units chainsaw crews and more with over 65000 trained volunteers southern baptist disaster relief is one of the largest disaster relief organizations in the us{116] similar services are also provided by methodist relief services the lutherans and samaritan's purse unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters to prevent abuse by criminals and for the safety of the volunteers procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these 'suvs' (spontaneous unaffiliated volunteers){117]the us congress established the center for excellence in disaster management and humanitarian assistance (coe) as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the asia-pacific regionthe national tribal emergency management council (nemc) is a non-profit educational organization developed for tribal organizations to share information and best practices as well as to discuss issues regarding public health and safety emergency management and homeland security affecting those under indian sovereignty ntmc is organized into regions

management institute (emi) serves as the national focal point for the development and delivery of emergency management training to enhance the capabilities of state territorial local and tribal government officials; volunteer organizations; fema's disaster workforce; other federal agencies; and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters and emergencies on the american public emi curricula are structured to meet the needs of this diverse audience with an emphasis on separate organizations working together in all-hazards emergencies to save lives and protect property particular emphasis is placed on governing doctrine such as the national response framework (nrf) national incident management system (nims) and the national preparedness guidelines{118] emi is fully accredited by the international association for continuing education and training (iacet) and the american council on education (ace){119]approximately 5500 participants attend resident courses each year while 100000 individuals participate in non-resident programs sponsored by emi and conducted locally by state emergency management agencies under cooperative agreements with fema another 150000 individuals participate in emi-supported exercises and approximately 1000 individuals participate in the chemical stockpile emergency preparedness program (csepp){120]the independent study program at emi consists of free courses offered to united states citizens in comprehensive emergency management techniques{121] course is-1 is entitled "emergency manager: an orientation to the position" and provides background information on fema and the role of emergency managers in agency and volunteer organization coordination the emi independent study (is) program a web-based distance learning program open to the public delivers extensive online training with approximately 200 courses it has trained more than 28 million individuals the emi is web site receives 25 to 3 million visitors a day{122]smaug model xe2x80x93 a basis for prioritizing hazard risks{edit]in emergency or disaster management the smaug model of identifying and prioritizing risk of hazards associated with natural and technological threats is an effective tool smaug stands for seriousness manageability acceptability urgency and growth and are the criteria used for prioritization of hazard risks the smaug model provides an effective means of prioritizing hazard risks based upon the aforementioned criteria in order to address the risks posed by the hazards to the avail of effecting effective mitigation reduction response and recovery methods{123]seriousness can be defined as "the relative impact in terms of people and dollars" this includes the potential for lives to be lost and potential for injury as well as the physical social and as mentioned economic losses that may be incurredmanageability can be defined as "the relative ability to mitigate or reduce the hazard (through managing the hazard or the community or both)" hazards presenting a high risk and as such requiring significant amounts of risk reduction initiatives will be rated high{123]acceptability - the degree to which the risk of hazard is acceptable in terms of political environmental social and economic impacturgency - this is related to the probability of risk of hazard and is defined in terms of how imperative it is to address the hazard {123]growth - this is the potential for the hazard or event to expand or increase in either probability or risk to community or both should vulnerability increase potential for growth may also increasean example of the numerical ratings for each of the four criteria is shown below:{124]manageabilityhigh = 7+medium = 5xe2x80x937low = 0xe2x80x934urgencyhigh = <20yrmedium =
