of nicolxc3xa1s de ovando then the governor of spain's caribbean territories{8] today it is part of the pueblo viejo sector of guaynabo just to the west of the present san juan metropolitan area a year later the settlement was moved to a site then called puerto rico spanish for "rich port" or "good port" after its similar geographical features to the town of puerto rico of gran canaria in the canary islands{9] in 1521 the newer settlement was given its formal name puerto rico de san juan bautistathe ambiguous use of san juan bautista and puerto rico for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (puerto rico) had become that of the entire island leading to the city being identified as puerto rico de puerto rico on maps of the era{10]{11]{12]san juan and bay puerto rico 1766san juan as a settlement of the spanish empire was used by merchant and military ships traveling from spain as the first stopover in the americas because of its prominence in the caribbean a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the new world to europe because of the rich cargoes san juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time{13]the city was witness to attacks from the english led by sir francis drake in 1595 (in what is known as the battle of puerto rico) and by george clifford earl of cumberland in 1598 artillery from san juan's fort el morro repelled drake; however clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city{14] after a few months of english occupation clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness in 1625 the city was sacked by dutch forces led by captain balduino enrico (also known as boudewijn hendrickszbowdoin henrick) but el morro withstood the assault and was not taken the dutch were counterattacked by captain juan de amezquita and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the spanish troops in el morro castle the land battle left 60 dutch soldiers dead and enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of amezquita{15]{unreliable source?] the dutch ships at sea were boarded by puerto ricans who defeated those aboard after a long battle the spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion on october 21 enrico set la fortaleza and the city ablaze captains amezquita and andre botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard they drove enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships{16]the british attack in 1797 during the french revolutionary wars led by sir ralph abercromby (who had just conquered trinidad) his army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the puerto rican defenses proved more resilient than those of trinidad various events and circumstances including liberalized commerce with spain the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the royal decree of graces of 1815 and the colonial revolutions led to an expansion of san juan and other puerto rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th centuryla plaza san juan ca 1900on

fought a brief battle with an auxiliary cruiser of spain name unknown resulting in a spanish victory around this time captain xc3x81ngel rivero mxc3xa9ndez was assigned the command of the spanish forces in the fortress of san cristxc3xb3bal in san juan on may 10 the yale returned to san juan bay rivero-mxc3xa9ndez ordered his men to open fire upon the ussxc2xa0yale using an ordoxc3xb1ez 15 centimeter cannon thus becoming the first attack against the americans in puerto rico during the spanishxe2x80x93american war{19] for his actions captain rivero-mendez was awarded the "cruz de la orden de merito militar" (the cross of the order of the military merit) first class{19] the residents of san juan were furious with rivero and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the american bombardments nothing came of those accusations and capt rivero-mxc3xa9ndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in san juan to captain henry a reed of the us army after the treaty of paris of 1898 was signed{19] on july 25 general nelson a miles landed at guxc3xa1nica (in southwestern puerto rico) with 3300xc2xa0soldiers in what was known as the puerto rican campaign the american troops found some resistance and engaged the spanish and puerto rican troops in battle the most notable of these the battles of yauco and asomante all military actions in puerto rico were suspended august 13 1898 after president william mckinley and french ambassador jules cambon acting on behalf of the spanish government signed an armistice{20]{21] spain ceded the island to the united states later the same year by signing the treaty of pariscamp las casas located in the district of santurce served as the main training camp for the puerto rican soldiers prior to world war i and world war ii; the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the "porto rico regiment of infantry" which was renamed the 65th infantry regiment of the united states army by the reorganization act of june 4 1920 the 65th infantry was deactivated in 1956 and became the only unit ever to be transferred from an active army component to the puerto rico national guard{22]shanty town along the martxc3xadn pexc3xb1a canal 1973lieutenant texc3xb3filo marxuach (retired as a lieutenant colonel) a native of arroyo puerto rico fired the first shot in what is considered to be the first shot of world war i fired by the regular armed forces of the united states against any ship flying the colors of the central powers{23] marxuach who was a member of the "porto rico regiment of infantry" and officer of the day on march 25 1915 opened fire on the odenwald an armed german supply vessel when it was trying to force its way out of san juan's bay{24] the shots ordered by lt marxuach were the first fired by the united states in world war i{25]in 1919 fxc3xa9lix rigau carrera "el aguila de sabana grande" (the eagle from sabana grande) the first puerto rican pilot became the first native puerto rican to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his curtiss jn-4 from las casas at the time the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also puerto rico's first commercial airport and rigau carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the air field{26] camp las casas was eventually closed down and in 1950 a public housing project by the name of residencial fray bartolome de las casas was constructed on its former locationon january 2 1947 the people of san juan elected felisa rincxc3xb3n de gautier (also known as doxc3xb1a fela) (1897xe2x80x931994) as their mayor thus she became the first woman to be elected as the mayor of a capital city in any of the americas{27] during the cold war era she ordered the establishment of the island's first civil defense system under the directorship of colonel gilberto josxc3xa9 marxuach (texc3xb3filo's son){28] rincxc3xb3n de gautier served as mayor until january 2 1969historic coat of arms of san juan (spanish rule)on october 30 1950 san juan was the scene of the san juan uprising one of many uprisings which occurred in various towns and cities in puerto rico by the puerto rican nationalist party against the governments of puerto rico and the united states among the uprising's main objective was to attack "la fortaleza" (the governors mansion) and the united states federal court house building in old san juan in accordance to the planned uprising in san juan a group of nationalists were supposed to attack simultaneously the gubernatorial mansion la fortaleza where puerto rican governor luis muxc3xb1oz marxc3xadn resided and the united states federal court house which is located close to an area called "la marina" in old san juan the la fortaleza battle which ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes and ended when four of the five attackers were killed{29]coat of arms and flag of san juanmain article: diego de torres vargason march 8 1948 the city government of san juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange field in the center of which is the coat of arms of the city the orange color was based and taken from father diego de torres vargas' text and it readsxc2xa0: "escudo de armas dado a puerto rico por los reyes catxc3xb3licos en el axc3xb1o de 1511 siendo procurador un vecino llamado pedro

pablo ubarri sought permission to link san juan with rxc3xado piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878 the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district at the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed the township was split into three parts and its main settlement merged with the city
