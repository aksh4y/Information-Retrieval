county virginia across the potomac river from washington dc in whose 624 acres (253xc2xa0ha) the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried beginning with the civil war as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars the united states department of the army a component of the united states department of defense (dod) controls the cemeterythe national cemetery was established during the civil war on the grounds of arlington house which had been the estate of the family of confederate general robert e lee's wife mary anna (custis) lee (a great-granddaughter of martha washington) the cemetery along with arlington house memorial drive the hemicycle and the arlington memorial bridge form the arlington national cemetery historic district listed on the national register of historic places in april 2014{2]{3] like nearly all federal installations in arlington county it has a washington dc mailing addressin recent years the department of the army has made plans and taken actions to expand the cemetery onto public lands that the national park service (nps) controlled or that arlington county or the commonwealth of virginia owned as well as to restrict bicycle use within the cemetery

washington parke custis grandson of martha washington acquired the land that now is arlington national cemetery in 1802 and began construction of arlington house (the name is ultimately derived from the village of arlington gloucestershire england where custis' family was originally from) the estate passed to custis' daughter mary anna who had married united states army officer robert e lee custis' will gave a "life inheritance" to mary lee allowing her to live at and run arlington estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it{4] upon her death the arlington estate passed to her eldest son george washington custis lee{4]when virginia seceded from the union at the start of the american civil war robert e lee resigned his commission on april 20 1861 and took command of the armed forces of the commonwealth of virginia later becoming commander of the army of northern virginia{5] on may 7 troops of the virginia militia occupied arlington and arlington house{6] with confederate forces occupying arlington's high ground the capital of the union was left in an untenable military position{7] although unwilling to leave arlington house mary lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers so she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sister's estate at ravensworth in fairfax county virginia on may 14{8]{9] on may 3 general winfield scott ordered brigadier general irvin mcdowell to clear arlington and the city of alexandria virginia of all troops not loyal to the united states{10] mcdowell occupied arlington without opposition on may 24{11]arlington houseat the outbreak of the civil war most military personnel who died in battle near washington dc were buried at the united states soldiers' cemetery in washington dc or alexandria cemetery in alexandria virginia but by late 1863 both were nearly full{12] on july 16 1862 congress passed legislation authorizing the us federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead and put the us army quartermaster general in charge of this program{12] in may 1864 union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the battle of the wilderness quartermaster general montgomery c meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery within weeks his staff reported that arlington estate was the most suitable property in the area{12] the property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves) it had a view of the district of columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing it was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the confederate states of america and denying robert e lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration{13] the first military burial at arlington for william henry christman was made on may 13 1864{14] close to what is now the northeast gate in section 27{15] however meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until june 15 1864{16] arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until president harry s truman issued executive order 9981 on july 26 1948{17]the old guard transports the flag-draped casket of the second sergeant major of the army george w dunaway who was buried with full military honors at arlington national cemeterythe government acquired arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for 26800 equal to 410000 today{18] mrs lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent attempting to pay the 9207 in property taxes (equal to 1400 today) assessed on the estate in a timely manner{19] the government turned away her agent refusing to accept the tendered payment in 1874 custis lee heir under his grandfather's will passing the estate in trust to his mother sued the united states claiming ownership of arlington on december 9 1882 the us supreme court ruled 5xe2x80x934 in lee's favor in united states v lee deciding that arlington had been confiscated without due process{19]{20] after that decision congress returned the estate to him and on march 3 1883 custis lee sold it back to the government for 150000 (equal to 3271364 in 2017) at a signing ceremony with secretary of war robert todd lincoln{18]{21] the land then became a military reservation{22]president herbert hoover conducted the first national memorial day ceremony in arlington national cemetery on may 30 1929{23]freedmen's village{edit]beginning in 1863 the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves giving the name of "freedmen's village" to the land the government constructed rental houses that 1100 to 3000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1100 acres (450xc2xa0ha) of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the civil war and after war ended{21]{24] however after the land became part of a military reservation the government asked the villagers to leave when some remained john a commerford the superintendent of arlington national cemetery asked the army's quartermaster general in 1887 to close the village on the grounds that people living in the village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood{22]{25] the quartermaster general and the secretary of war then approved commerford's request{22] the last of the village's residents departed after the 56th united states congress appropriated 75000 in 1900 to settle the government's debts to them{22]recent expansion{edit]with limited space but large numbers of world war ii korean war vietnam war and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at arlington the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue in 1991 cemetery superintendent john c metzler jr implemented a 14 million plan to clear a former 13 acres (53xc2xa0ha) parking lot to create space for about 9000 new grave sites{26]the cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) of woodland from the nps-controlled arlington house in 1996{27]{28] and 2001{29]{30] 37 acres (15xc2xa0ha) of land in 1999 from the dod that was the site of the navy annex building{31]{32] 8 acres (32xc2xa0ha) of land in 1999 from the department of the army that was part of fort myer{31]{33] 4 acres (16xc2xa0ha) of land from arlington county's southgate road right-of-way in 2004{34] and just under 10 acres (40xc2xa0ha) of land from fort myer in 2005{29]{35]{36]gravestones at arlington national cemetery are marked by us flags each memorial dayin 2007 metzler implemented the millennium project a 35 million expansion plan to begin utilizing the arlington woodland fort myer and navy annex land the project also included converting 40 acres (16xc2xa0ha) of unused space and 4 acres (16000xc2xa0m2) of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26000 graves and 5000 inurnments the millennium project expanded the cemetery's physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the american civil war{35] several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized metzler's plans as did the nps and the manager of arlington house{35]{36]{37]on march 26 2013 the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 (public law 113-6) appropriated to the dod 84 million to plan design and construct the millennium project{38] the legislation additionally appropriated to the dod 19 million to study plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery's burial space{38]navy annex property expansion controversy{edit]in 1998 a congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the navy annex and fort myer then occupied led to concerns that arlington county officials had not been properly consulted leading to the withdrawal of the proposal{39] however the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 (public law 106-65) which was enacted into law during october 1999 subsequently required the secretary of defense to transfer to the secretary of the army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres (15xc2xa0ha) navy annex property the act required the secretary of defense to demolish the annex's buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery while requiring the secretary of the army to incorporate the annex property into the cemetery{32]in january 2013 the county manager of arlington county virginia and the executive director of the army national military cemeteries (consisting of arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers' and airmen's home national cemetery){40] signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) between the arlington county board and the department of the army to expand the cemetery even further under the tentative plan arlington county would give up the easement for southgate road (which lies between the navy annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary) and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the navy annex site for a new southgate road in exchange the department of defense would give the navy annex parking lot to the countythe army would also transfer land west of south joyce street to columbia pike to arlington county additionally the commonwealth of virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the virginia department of transportation land bounded by south joyce street columbia pike and south washington boulevard the cloverleaf interchange between columbia pike and s washington blvd would be eliminated and the hairpin turn in columbia pike straightened to provide a safer more natural exit from s washington blvd onto columbia pike although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the commonwealth of virginia's cooperation the mou if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery{41]however in december 2016 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 (public law 114-328) authorized the secretary of the army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from arlington county and the commonwealth of virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the southgate road south joyce street and washington boulevard right-of-ways including the washington boulvard-columbia pike interchange{42] the army then informed the arlington county government in june 2017 that the army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the county the army told the county that the army would use the entire navy annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres (20xc2xa0ha) of public land that arlington county then owned the army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres (28xc2xa0ha) of land located between columbia pike and interstate 395 that the commonwealth of virginia then owned{43]arlington woods expansion controversy{edit]a portion of arlington woods on humphreys drive (2013)on february 22 1995 officials of the united states department of the interior and the united states department of the army signed an agreement to transfer from arlington house the robert e lee memorial to the army a part of arlington woods which was located in section 29 of the nps at arlington national cemetery between arlington house and fort myer{44] the property transfer which involved 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) of nps land was intended to permit metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries{28]{45]environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24 acres (97xc2xa0ha) remnant of an historically important stand of native trees{37]{46] a historical marker near the woodland notes that while visiting arlington house in 1825 gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette had warned mary lee fitzhugh custis the wife of george washington parke custis: "cherish these forest trees around your mansion recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow" the marker further notes that the virginia native plant society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in virginia{47]on september 23 1996 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 (public law 104-201) authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army all of the land in section 29 that was within an "arlington national cemetery interment zone" and some of the land in the section that was within a "robert e lee memorial preservation zone"{27]{28]on march 5 1998 the nps which is a component of the department of the interior informed the national capital planning commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres (16xc2xa0ha) to the cemetery rather than the 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) that the 1995 agreement had described in response metzler stated: "i was surprised but we will continue to work with the department of interior and see what happens"{28]on july 12 1999 the nps issued a federal register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment (ea) for the transfer{45]{48] the ea stated that the interment zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in arlington county this forest was the same type that once covered the arlington estate and had regenerated from trees that were present historically a forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old the interment zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources in addition to those in the preservation zone{48] the ea described four alternative courses of action{48]in contrast to the nps's march 1998 statement to the national capital planning commission the 1999 ea stated that the preferred alternative (alternative 1) would transfer to the cemetery approximately 96 acres (39xc2xa0ha) comprising most of the interment zone and the northern tip of the preservation zone{48] another alternative (alternative 3) would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) interment zone while keeping the 125 acres (51xc2xa0ha) preservation zone under nps jurisdiction{48] the ea concluded: "public law 104-201 directed the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army jurisdiction over the interment zone which is the plan in alternative 3 adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law"{48]map showing the millennium project's expansion of arlington national cemetery into arlington woods and fort myeron december 28 2001 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 (public law 107-107) repealed the "obsolete" part of public law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of section 29 to the secretary of the army{30] the new legislation required the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) interment zone{30] the transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres (49xc2xa0ha) of nps land that the 1995 agreement and alternative 3 in the 1999 ea had describedthe 2001 legislation required the secretary of the army to use the interment zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium{30] in addition the legislation required the secretary of the interior to manage the remainder of section 29 "in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for arlington house the robert e lee memorial"{30]on december 12 2012 the united states army corps of engineers asked for comments on a draft ea that described a further expansion of arlington national cemetery as part of the millennium project{49]{50]{51] the 2012 draft ea was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the 17 acres (69xc2xa0ha) of ft myer grounds as well as 10 acres (40xc2xa0ha) of section 29 woodland the draft ea described seven alternatives the preferred alternative (alternative e) called for the removal of about one-half of the 1700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches (15xc2xa0cm) or greater on the site about 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of arlington woods{52] the draft ea concluded: "based on the evaluation of environmental impacts no significant impacts would be expected from the proposed action; therefore an environmental impact statement will not be prepared and a finding of no significant impact will be prepared and signed"{52]on march 12 2013 the corps of engineers released a revised ea for the millennium project{53]{54] the revised ea contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft ea that had criticized the project and parts of the ea while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere{55] however the department of forestry of the commonwealth of virginia found that based on information in the draft ea the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the commonwealth's forest resources{56] the revised ea did not change the preferred alternative (alternative e) or the army's plans to prepare and sign the finding of no significant impact (fonsi) that the draft ea had described{57]on june 5 2013 after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised ea the corps of engineers released a final ea and a signed fonsi for the millennium project{58]{59] the final ea and the fonsi retained alternative e as the preferred alternative{58] the final ea stated that of the 905 trees to be removed 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches{60]{61] the project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 263 acres (106xc2xa0ha) area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a national register of historic places nomination form for arlington house had described in 1966{60]{62] about 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old{60] approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area{60] at a public hearing on july 11 2013 the national capital planning commission approved the site and building plans for the millennium project{63]2010 mismanagement controversy{edit]main article: arlington national cemetery mismanagement controversyon june 9 2010 united states secretary of the army john m mchugh reprimanded the cemetery's superintendent john c metzler jr and his deputy thurman higgenbotham after a dod inspector general's report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs buried coffins in shallow graves and buried bodies on top of one another{64] metzler who had already announced his intention to retire on july 2 2010 admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement{64] the investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by "dysfunctional management lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate"{65]{66] both metzler and higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced{67]in march 2011 as a result of the problems discovered kathryn condon the recently appointed executive director of the army national military cemeteries announced that the cemetery's staff had been increased from 102 to 159 she added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because "they didn't have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do"{68]the mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals which also proved controversial until 2005 the cemetery's administration gave free access with the family's permission to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery according to the washington post in 2008 the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005{69]management turnover{edit]after the cemetery's management controversy began to end the army appointed patrick k hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in june 2010 he was promoted permanently to the position in october 2010 hallinan had previously worked for the office of field programs in the national cemetery administration an agency of the united states department of veterans' affairs in that capacity hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries national cemetery policy procedures and operations{70] hallinan was promoted to executive director of the army national military cemeteries upon the retirement of kathryn condon in spring 2014{71]in may 2014 hallinan stepped down and was replaced by jack e lechner jr as superintendent of the cemetery lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the us army he rose to the rank of colonel (retiring in november 2011) having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the supply division of the joint chiefs of staff overseeing the equipping of iraqi and afghanistan national security forces since june 2010 he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under hallinan{71]the army removed lechner as superintendent of the cemetery in early august 2015 after a performance review "called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader" the army declined to elaborate further and appointed hallinan to be the temporary cemetery superintendent until the army could find a successor{72]wreaths across america{edit]wreaths laid at arlington national cemetery december 2013beginning in 1992 the morrill worcester wreath company in harrington maine had a surplus at the end of the holiday season recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery worcester donated to the cemetery 5000 wreaths to honor the cemetery's dead with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company after thirteen years of similar donations in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the internet thousands of people called worcester wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries{73]in 2006 over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with arlington's additionally the project had its first xe2x80x9cveterans honor paradexe2x80x9d with "patriot guard riders" who escorted the wreaths from maine to the cemetery the parade which is held each year now visits schools monuments veteransxe2x80x99 homes and communities along its route{73]at the end of 2006 worcester's company supplied wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country{74] assisted by veterans and truckers worcester established in 2007 a nonprofit organization named "wreaths across america"{73] in december 2008 the united states senate agreed to a resolution that designated december 13 2008 as xe2x80x9cwreaths across america dayxe2x80x9d{75]in 2014 volunteers placed over 700000 memorial wreaths at 1000 locations in the united states and overseas including the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor bunker hill valley forge and the national september 11 memorial at the world trade center site in new york city during that year volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time{73] in 2016 this number increased to 12 million wreaths being placed at more than 1230 cemeteries across the nation{76]conflict of interest charges have been made against wreaths across america because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier worcestor wreath company also run by the morrill family in the same town the charity's purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the company's revenue and profits in late 2015 the wall street journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting{77] in 2015 alone the wsj reported profits of over 1 million on sales of over 850000 wreaths to the charity raising concerns about competitive bidding reporting that several competitors had asked to bid significantly below the price offered by worcestor wreath company but were denied access150th anniversary{edit]during may and june 2014 the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events tours and lectures{78] during these celebrations cemetery officials formally re-designated the old amphitheater as the james tanner amphitheater james r tanner was a union army officer who lost both legs during the war he later became a war department stenographer and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of abraham lincoln he later was active in the grand army of the republic a union army veterans group tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater{79]sections{edit]arlington national cemeterythe cemetery is divided into 70 sections with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion{80] section 60 in the southeast part of the cemetery is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the global war on terror since 2001{81] section 21 also known as the nurses section is the area of arlington national cemetery where many nurses are buried and is the site of the spanish-american war nurses memorial and the nurses memorial{82] another sectionxe2x80x94chaplains hillxe2x80x94includes monuments to jewish protestant and roman catholic military chaplains in 1901 confederate soldiers buried at the soldiers' home and various locations within arlington were reinterred in a confederate section that was authorized by congress in 1900 on june 4 1914 the united daughters of the confederacy dedicated the confederate memorial designed by moses ezekiel upon his death in 1917 ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the confederate army{83] all confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded{84] more than 3800 former slaves called "contrabands" during the civil war are buried in section 27 their headstones are designated with the word "civilian" or "citizen"{85]grave markers niches and headstones{edit]the united states department of veterans affairs oversees the national cemetery administration's orders{86] for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased submitted with information provided by the next of kin{87] that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers the department of veterans affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased's faith{88] this number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy{89]prior to 2007 the united states department of veterans affairs (va) did not allow the use of the pentacle as an "emblem of belief" on tombstones in military cemeteries this policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on april 23 following a series of lawsuits by the family of patrick stewart against the va{90]{91]{92]between 1947 and 2001 privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery the sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections{93] nevertheless the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001 including an artillery piece{94]there are 32 commonwealth war dead burials and some headstones are commonwealth war graves commission stylearlington memorial amphitheater{edit]main article: arlington memorial amphitheaterthe interior of memorial amphitheaterthe tomb of the unknowns is part of the arlington memorial amphitheater the memorial amphitheater has hosted state funerals and memorial day and veterans day ceremonies ceremonies are also held for easter about 5000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year the structure is mostly built of imperial danby marble from vermont the memorial display room between the amphitheater and the tomb of the unknowns uses botticino stone imported from italy the amphitheater was the result of a campaign by ivory kimball to construct a place to honor america's servicemenwomen congress authorized the structure on march 4 1913 woodrow wilson laid the cornerstone for the building on october 15 1915 the cornerstone contained 15 items including a bible and a copy of the constitution{95]before the arlington memorial amphitheater was completed in 1921 important ceremonies were held at what is now known as the "old amphitheater" this structure sits where robert e lee once had his gardens the amphitheater was built in 1868 under the direction of civil war general john a logan gen james a garfield was the featured speaker at the decoration day dedication ceremony may 30 1868 later being elected as president of the united states 1881 the amphitheater has an encircling colonnade with a latticed roof that once supported a web of vines the amphitheater has a marble dais known as "the rostrum" which is inscribed with the us national motto found on the great seal of the united states e pluribus unum ("out of many one") the rostrum was designed by general montgomery c meigs then quartermaster general of the us army{96] the amphitheater seats 1500 people and has hosted

april 6 1948 there is a meticulous routine which the guard follows when watching over the graves{98] the tomb guard:marches 21 steps down the black mat behind the tombturns faces east for 21 secondsturns and faces north for 21 secondstakes 21 steps down the matrepeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the changing of the guardafter each turn the guard executes a sharp "shoulder-arms" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the tomb and any possible threattwenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowedxe2x80x94the 21-gun saluteeach turn the guard makes precise movements and followed by a loud click of the heels as he snaps them together the guard is changed every half-hour during daylight in the summer and every hour during daylight in the winter and every two hours at night (when the cemetery is closed to the public) regardless of weather conditionsarlington amphitheater1922 issuea commemorative stamp was issued on november 11 1922 the first anniversary of the first entombment picturing the amphitheater it encompasses the

for interment (ground burial) and inurnment{107] due to limited space the criteria for ground burial eligibility are more restrictive than at other national cemeteries as well as more restrictive than for inurnment in the columbariumthe persons specified below are eligible for ground burial in the cemetery unless otherwise prohibited{108] the last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably interment may be of casketed or cremated remainsany active-duty member of the armed forces (except those members serving on active duty for training only)any

intermentprovided certain conditions are met a former member of the armed forces may be buried in the same grave with a close relative who is already buried and is the primary eligibleinurnment criteria for columbarium{edit]due at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial standards for inurnment (burial of cremated remains) in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the cemetery in general any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment eligibility for inurnment is described fully in 32 cfr xc2xa7 55315aprohibitions against interment or memorialization{edit]congress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that even if otherwise eligible for burial lose that eligibility one such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes as defined in 38 us code xc2xa7 2411 capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence (with or without parole) the reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent timothy mcveigh from being eligible at arlington national cemetery but it has since been amended to prevent others{109]also prohibited under the same statute are those determined with clear and convincing evidence to have avoided such conviction by death or flightnotable burials{edit]main article: list of people buried at

requirements{edit]president donald trump participates in the memorial day ceremonythe cemetery has within recent years announced policies and procedures that limit visitor access to the cemetery's grounds the cemetery's executive director has stated that some of these may create delays for visitors some have become controversialbicycle use policy{edit]on august 6 2013 patrick hallinan executive director army national military cemeteries issued an official memorandum that contained the cemetery's then-current bicycle use policy{115]{116] the memorandum permitted cyclists to travel in only one direction on only one route unless otherwise authorized by the executive director{116] this "white line" route traveled from the old post chapel gate at joint base myer-henderson hall towards the main entrance of the cemetery at memorial avenue using meigs drive sherman drive and schley drive{116] the memorandum stated without explanation: xe2x80xb3bicycle traffic will not be permitted to travel in

march 31{116] cyclists had to wear bicycle helmets that certain designated organizations had approved{116] bicycles had to be equipped with headlights tail lights or red reflectors in lieu of tail lights regardless of the time of travel{116]on may 11 2016 the department of the army published in the federal register a proposed rule that would among other things prohibit a visitor to an army national military cemetery (arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers' and airmen's home national cemetery) from riding a bicycle without first acquiring a pass to visit a relative's gravesite or columbarium niche{117] after receiving 13 comments from 13 individuals concerning the use of bicycles in the cemetery (including comments from representatives of the arlington county board and local bicycle advocacy groups that opposed the new restrictions) the department of the army published a final rule in the federal register on september 26 2016 that implemented the proposed rule effective october 26 2016{118]in accordance with the final rule the cemetery issued a new bicycle use policy effective october 26 2016 the policy stated that bicycling would no longer be allowed on cemetery grounds without a family pass the policy further stated that "bicyclists traversing the cemetery grounds do impact funeral services and the experience that families expect and deserve as they visit their loved onexe2x80x99s grave  as there are no bike paths on the cemetery grounds mixing cyclists with pedestrians and vehicles creates a safety hazard"{119]security procedures{edit]in september 2016 hallinan announced that the cemetery was increasing security measures for its visitors in addition to random identification checks and other security measures already in place the cemetery will require pedestrians to enter at set access points: the main entrance on memorial avenue the ord and weitzel gate and the old post chapel gate at joint base myer-henderson hall before entering the cemetery through its main entrance all pedestrians will be screened through the cemetery's welcome center all vehicle access will require presenting valid government-issued photo identification such as a driverxe2x80x99s license or passport when entering the cemetery vehicles will also be subject to random inspections hallinan stated that these processes may result in delays when entering the cemetery{120]in popular culture{edit]in batman v superman: dawn of justice the cemetery appeared as the backdrop for a state funeral held for superman by the united states army{121]
