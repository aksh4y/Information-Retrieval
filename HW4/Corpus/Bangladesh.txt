(19xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) of land destroyed and 11000xc2xa0km (6800xc2xa0mi) of roads damaged or destroyed effectively two-thirds of the country was underwater the severity of the flooding was attributed to unusually high monsoon rains the shedding off of equally unusually large amounts of melt water from the himalayas and the widespread cutting down of trees (that would have intercepted rain water) for firewood or animal husbandry{102]bangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change natural hazards that come from increased rainfall rising sea
