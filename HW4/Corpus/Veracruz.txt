cross") which was originally called the villa rica de la vera cruz the suffix is in honor of ignacio de la llave y segura zevallos (1818xe2x80x931863) who was the governor of the veracruz from 1861 to 1862 the statexe2x80x99s seal was authorized by the state legislature in 1954 adapting the one used for the port of veracruz and created by the spanish in the early 16th century{10]geography{edit]political geography{edit]the state is a crescent-shaped strip of land wedged between the sierra madre oriental to the west and the gulf of mexico to the east{11] its total area is 78815xc2xa0km2 (30431xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) accounting for about 37 of mexicoxe2x80x99s total territory{12] it stretches about 650xc2xa0km (4039xc2xa0mi) north to south but its width varies from between 212xc2xa0km (132xc2xa0mi) to 36xc2xa0km (22xc2xa0mi) with an average of about 100xc2xa0km (62xc2xa0mi) in width{13]{14] veracruz shares common borders with the states of tamaulipas (to the north) oaxaca and chiapas (to the south) tabasco (to the southeast) and puebla hidalgo and san luis potosxc3xad (on the west) veracruz has 690xc2xa0km (429xc2xa0mi) of coastline with the gulf of mexico{15]natural geography{edit]pico de orizabathe natural geography can be categoried into nine regions: the sierra de zongolica the tecolutla region the huayacocotla region the metlac river area the tuxtlas region the central region the laguna del castillo region the pueblo viejo-tamiahua region and the laguna de alvarado region{13] the topography changes drastically rising from the narrow coastal plains to the highlands of the eastern sierra madre elevation varies from sea level to the pico de orizaba mexicoxe2x80x99s highest peak at 5636xc2xa0m (18491xc2xa0ft) above sea level{12]{15] the coast consists of low sandy strips interspersed with tidewater streams and lagoons{14] most of the long coastline is narrow and sandy with unstable dunes small shifting lagoons and points{13] the mountains are of the sierra madre oriental and the trans-mexican volcanic belt mountain ranges include the sierra de topila sierra de otontepec sierra de huayacocotla sierra de coxquihui sierra de chiconquiaco sierra de jalacingo sierra de axocuapan sierra de huatusco sierra de zongolica and the sierra de los tuxtla major peaks include pico de orizaba (5636xc2xa0m 18491xc2xa0ft) cofre de perote (4282xc2xa0m 140486xc2xa0ft) cerro de tecomates (3227xc2xa0m 10587xc2xa0ft) cerro del vigxc3xada alta (3055xc2xa0m 10023xc2xa0ft) and cerro de 3 tortas (2997xc2xa0m 9833xc2xa0ft) the pico de orizaba is covered in snow year round; the cofre de perote is covered in winter major valleys include the acultzingo cxc3xb3rdoba maltrata orizaba and san andrxc3xa9s{13]jamapa rivermore than 40 rivers and tributaries provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power; they also carry rich silt down from the eroding highlands which is deposited in the valleys and coastal areas{14] all of the rivers and streams that cross the state begin in the sierra madre oriental or in the central mesa flowing east to the gulf of mexico the important ones include: actopan river acuatempan river rxc3xado blanco cazones river coatzacoalcos river rxc3xado de la antigua hueyapan river jamapa river nautla river pxc3xa1nuco river papaloapan river tecolutla river tonalxc3xa1 river tuxpan river and xoloapa river the largest in terms of water discharge are the pxc3xa1nuco tuxpan papaloapan coazocoalcos and uxpanapa the panuco tuxpan papaloapan and coatzacoalcos are navigable{13] two of mexico's most polluted rivers the coatzacoalcos and the rxc3xado blanco are located in the state much of the pollution comes from industrial sources but the discharge of sewerage and uncontrolled garbage disposal are also major contributors the state has very few sewage treatment plants with only 10 of sewage being treated before discharge{16]the state also has ten major waterfalls and ten major coastal lagoons there is only one significant lake called lake catemaco off the coast are the islands of isla de lobos isla de los burros isla de sacrificios isla de salmendina isla del idolo isladel toro isla frijoles isla juan a ramirez isla pajaros and isla terrxc3xb3n and the ocean reefs called blanquilla medio tangxc3xbcillo tuxpan gualleguilla gallega anegada de adento anegada de afuera and

max and min temperatures in xc2xb0fprecipitation totals in inchesthe large variation of altitude results in a large mixture of climates from cold snow-topped mountain peaks to warm wet tropical areas on the coast{15] 32 of the state is classified as hot and humid 52 as hot and semi humid 9 is warm and humid 6 as temperate and humid and 1 is classified as cold{12] hot and humid and hot and semi-humid climates dominate from sea level to about 1000xc2xa0m (32808xc2xa0ft) above sea level average annual temperature ranges from 22 to 26c with precipitation varying from 2000xc2xa0mm (787xc2xa0in) to just over 3500xc2xa0mm (1378xc2xa0in) per year cooler and humid climates are found at elevations between 1000xc2xa0m (32808xc2xa0ft) and 1600xc2xa0m (52493xc2xa0ft) these have an average temperature of between 18 and 22c with precipitation varying between 2000xc2xa0mm (787xc2xa0in) and 2500xc2xa0mm (984xc2xa0in) temperate climates are found at higher altitudes between 1600xc2xa0m (52493xc2xa0ft) and 2800xc2xa0m (91864xc2xa0ft) temperatures here vary from 12 to 18c with precipitation varying more between 500xc2xa0mm (197xc2xa0in) and 2500xc2xa0mm (984xc2xa0in) cold climates are found at the highest elevations reaching up to the cofre de perote and the pico de orizaba there is a small semi arid region around the city of perote and the west of the huasteca area this is due to a rain shadow caused by the trans-mexican volcanic belt and the sierra madre oriental which do not permit the flow of moist gulf air to this region{13]ecosystems{edit]shore of lake catemacovarious types of forest cover the state but evergreen tropical forest dominate{13] the statexe2x80x99s ecoregion is of great importance for many plant and animal species it is a center of plant endemism and has two separate endemic bird areas{17]the northern part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna it is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in mexico although little of this remains mostly on steep slopes this tropical forest is situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extends into southern tamaulipas state on the east side of the sierra madre oriental the soils here are volcanic and shallow but with rich organic matter species that predominate include mayan breadnut (brosimum alicastrum) sapodilla (manilkara zapota) rosadillo (celtis monoica) bursera simaruba dendropanax arboreus and sideroxylon capiri this ecoregion extends into the central part of the state with vegetation changing to include mahogany (swietenia macrophylla) sapodilla (manilkara zapota) bernoullia flammea and astronium graveolens {17]veracruz has been described as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere there is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous arsenura armida as well as insects the state is known for its many arachnids and features over 25 species of tarantula (theraphosidae) of which many are endemic the state is part of birdlife internationalxe2x80x99s endemic bird area(eba) project due to the number of endemic birds here some of these include green-cheeked amazon (amazona viridigenalis) tamaulipas crow (corvus imparatus) altamira yellowthroat (geothlypis flavovelata) and crimson-collared grosbeak (rhodothraupis celaeno) despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents (peromyscus ochraventer neotoma angustapalata) the jaguar (panthera onca) ocelot (leopardus pardalis) jaguarundi (herpailurus yaguarondi) and coati (nasua narica) {17] the endangered baird's tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state's southern jungle regions such as bixc3xb3sfera los tuxtlas this region is also the northernmost extent of the primate alouatta palliata or mantled howlermost of veracruzxe2x80x99s native forests have been destroyed and replaced by scrub and secondary communities of trees from 1900 to 1987 over 18553xc2xa0km2 (71634xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) of forest had been logged resulting in the loss of habitat and biodiversity much of the logging is due to commercial timber search for tropical hardwoods and the clearing of land for local farmers especially for cattle grazing only 20 of veracruzxe2x80x99s original ecosystem remains with 64 transformed by human exploitation despite some efforts at conservation and reclamation exploitation continues to put pressure on remaining wild areas{17]bougainvilleathe state has 31 environmentally protected areas in 21 different municipalities nine are urban parks three are national parks (pico de orizaba cofre de perote and san josxc3xa9 de los molinos {13] the cofre de perote national park is 11700 hectares of pine and oyamel forest which was created in 1937 the los tuxtlas biosphere reserve covers the municipalities of xc3x81ngel r cabada santiago tuxtla san andres tuxtla catemaco soteapan mecayapan pajapan and tatahuicapan for a total of 155122xc2xa0ha

climate types forest types range from evergreen tropical rainforest to pine 75 of species here are also found in central america and there is a total of 2368 plant species some such as costus dirzoi daphnopsis megacarpa eugenia sotoesparzae inga sinacae miconia ibarrae mormodes tuxtlensis and thelypteris rachyflexuosa are native only to this area wildlife includes 102 mammal species 49 amphibian 109 reptilian 561 bird species and more species in danger of extinction include the jaguar spider monkey and anteater {13]the veracruz reef system is also considered to be a national park and is mostly off the coast of veracruz city boca del rxc3xado and alvarado the area includes coral reefs seaweed beds and other marine vegetation covering an area of 52239xc2xa0ha (1290854 acres) there are seventeen reefs in total some of which jut above the surface to form small islands this system links with the reef systems of campeche and yucatxc3xa1n {13]history{edit]pre-columbian{edit]olmec stone headthe history of the native peoples of the state of veracruz is complex in the pre-columbian period the modern-day state of veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures the huastecs and otomis occupied the north while the totonacs resided in the north-center the olmecs one of the oldest cultures in the americas became dominant in the southern part of veracruz{15] remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as pxc3xa1nuco castillo de teayo el zapotal las higueras quiahuiztlxc3xa1n el tajxc3xadn cempoala tres zapotes and san lorenzo tenochtitlxc3xa1n {18]the first major civilization in the territory of the current state was that of the olmecs the olmecs lived in the coatzacoalcos river region and it became the center of olmec culture the main ceremonial center here was san lorenzo tenochtitlxc3xa1n other major centers in the state include tres zapotes in the city of veracruz and la venta in tabasco the culture reached its height about 2600 years ago with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads{18] these ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period for this reason many anthropologists consider the olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many mesoamerican cultures that followed it by 300 bce this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in mesoamerica{15]another major group was the totonacs who have survived to the present day their region called totonacapan is centered between the cazones river and the papaloapan river in the north of the state pre-columbian totonacs lived from hunting fishing and agriculture mostly of corn beans chili peppers and squash this is also the native region of the vanilla bean clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture the major site is el tajxc3xadn located near papantla but the culture reached its apogee in cempoala (about five miles (8xc2xa0km) inland from the current port of veracruz) when it was conquered by the aztecs{18] when the spaniards arrived in 1519 the territory was still home to a population of about 250000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four totonac dialects 25000 were living in cempoala alone{15]the huastecs are in the far north of the veracruz and extend into parts of tamaulipas hidalgo san luis potosxc3xad querxc3xa9taro and puebla the language and agricultural techniques of these people and the maya are similar; however only a few buildings and ceramics remain from the early huastec culture this culture also reached its peak between 1200 and 1519 when it was conquered by the spanish{18]during the 15th and very early 16th century the aztecs came to dominate much of the state and dividing it into tributary provinces of tochtepec cuetlaxtlan cempoallan quauhtochco jalapa misantla and tlatlauhquitepec the aztecs were interested in the area's vegetation and crops such as cedars fruit cotton cacao corn beans and vanilla however the totonacs chafed under aztec rule with aztec rulers from axayacatl to moctezuma ii having to send soldiers to quell rebellions the huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the aztecs and relegated to the provinces of atlan and tochpan{15]colonial period 1519xe2x80x931821{edit]playa villa rica where the spanish built the first city of veracruzveracruz played an important part in the spanish conquest of the aztec empire by hernxc3xa1n cortxc3xa9s and his expedition members they founded villa rica de la vera cruz on may 18 1519 as the first spanish town in what is now mexico by doing so cortxc3xa9s threw off the authority of the governor of cuba diego velxc3xa1quez and took authority from the town council (cabildo) of veracruz and claim authority directly from the spanish crown a small contingent of the expedition remained at veracruz while the main body of conquerors moved inland{19]the totonacs were the first people with whom the spanish had contact on the american mainland{15] the very first contact was with captain juan de grijalva on the coastline north of the present-day city of veracruz{18] still chafing under aztec rule totonac ruler tlacochcalcatl welcomed hernxc3xa1n cortxc3xa9s and promised 50000 warriors to help defeat tenochtitlan the spanish helped the totonacs expel aztec tribute collectors and to seize control of some aztec outposts{15] the spanish founded the port city of veracruz on the coast as the first municipality under the direct control of the king of spain cortxc3xa9s then began his march inland to tenochtitlan{18] during the conquest the rest of the totonac peoples allied themselves with the spanish but the huastecs despite also being under aztec rule fought against them after the fall of tenochtitlan cortxc3xa9s sent a regiment to subdue the huastecs{15]during the early conquest era cortxc3xa9s distributed the labor of indigenous settlements to particular conquerors in an institution known as encomienda the indigenous ruler of the settlement was charged with mobilization labor and tribute that was due the holder of the encomienda veracruz had a number of encomiendas that changed hands a number of times but early on came under the direct control of the spanish crown rather than individual encomenderos{20]during the colonial era veracruz was the main port of entry for immigrants from spain african slaves and all types of luxury goods for import and export the first group of franciscans arrived in veracruz in 1524 walking barefoot to the capital of the spanish colony of new spain{21] the route between veracruz and the spanish capital of mexico city built on the site of the aztec capital tenochtitlan was the key trade route during the colonial era much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that cortxc3xa9s founded in 1519 veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of new spain and spain itself{15] to ensure the portxe2x80x99s monopoly it came to have control over almost all of new spain's gulf coastline{18] new spain's silver and cochineal red dye were the two most important exports from the port along with chocolate vanilla chili peppers and much more were exported imported were livestock (sheep cows goats horses) wheat and other cultivars from the caribbean slaves pineapple and sugar cane were introduced this made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period with attacks and sackings frequent{11]{15] this led to the building of the fort of san juan de ulxc3xbaa and the fortification of the city overall{18]much of totonac and huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day much of the reason for this is that the north of veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the spanish were looking for{15] veracruz is considered to be where the "mestizo" or mixed europeanindigenous race began which is a large part of mexican cultural identity{18]statue of rebel leader yangathough the spaniards had halted the azrtec wars and human sacrifices an unexpected problem arose european diseases decimated the native population of the province prompting the importation of african slaves during the colonial period starting in the 16th century the spanish imported between 500000xe2x80x931000000 west african slaves into mexico between 1535 and 1767 (miscegenation between indigenous and african population began almost immediately) new spain did not have any laws prohibiting interracial marriage hence the correct term is afro-mestizo which includes all 3 races: indigenous african and spanishrunaway slaves (cimarrones) became problematic to public order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways crown efforts against these groups began in earnest in the late sixteenth century but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 in the areas of villa rica nueva veracruz antxc3xb3n lizardo and the rio blanco area however the gravest of these occurred in the orizaba area where there were about 500 fugitive slaves in 1609 a leader named gaspar yanga led an insurrection against the spanish but was defeated in battle unrest continued eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the africans the right to form their own community exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed this was called san lorenzo de zerral but today it is known as the municipality of yanga this was the first time slavery was abolished in the americas{18]in the first half of the seventeenth century cities such as cxc3xb3rdoba orizaba and xalapa were formed or expanded to protect the trade route between mexico city and the port of veracruz during this time the spanish and mixed-race population increased as the purely indigenous population continued to fall to a fraction of pre-conquest levels (due now to mixing rather than disease) almost all trade in and out of new spain had to be with spain except for some limited trade authorized with england and other spanish colonies this would stay in place until 1778 when the decreto de libre comercio allowing a limited free trade within spanish-held realms lifted many of these restrictions on trade with europe this would make the port more important than it had been and led to increased prosperity for the inhabitantsoutside of the port in other areas of the province the economy was based on agriculture livestock and commerce in 1720 xalapa organized the first trade fair making it the center for trade between inland mexican goods and those from abroad this would lead to its eventual status as capital of the state{18]in 1746 the state was divided into the civil jurisdictions of pxc3xa1nuco tampico huayacocotla huauchinango papantla misantla xalapa jalacingo veracruz cxc3xb3rdoba orizaba cosamaloapan tuxtla and cotaxtla{18]the port city of veracruz and the fort of san juan de ulxc3xbaa where cortxc3xa9s landed three hundred years earlier was where the loyalist soldiers of the spanish crown made their last stand against the independence movement in 1824{15]independence{edit]depiction of the battle of veracruz during the mexicanxe2x80x93american warduring the mexican war of independence there was support for the insurgents in many parts of the state with skirmishes erupting in various parts as early as 1811 a major conspiracy against the colonial government was discovered in the port in 1812 with rebels taking ayahualulco and ixhuacxc3xa1n during the same year this forced royalist troops to withdraw to xalapa eventually this city along with the port were cut off from mexico city most of the state remained in rebel hands during the rest of the war although the commercial class of the port did not support the effort in 1821 juan de o'donojxc3xba the last viceroy of new spain came to the port to leave for spain however until 1823 spanish troops continued to occupy san juan de ulxc3xbaa fort in 1826 the city would receive the first of its four titles of "heroic city" for confronting these remaining spanish troops{18]while the last of the spanish held on in san juan de ulxc3xbaa agustxc3xadn de iturbide had been declared the emperor of mexico in 1822 however his reign quickly encountered resistance from those favoring a republican form of government including from antonio lxc3xb3pez de santa anna from his stronghold in veracruz state months later iturbide would go into exile and santa anna would eventually hold nine terms as president{15]{18]the french intervened in mexico through veracruz for the first time in the 1838 in what became the pastry war the port was blockaded efforts to defend the country were coordinated from xalapa the port was bombarded but eventually a settlement was reached{18]during the mexicanxe2x80x93american war the port was blockaded again this time by the americans initial american attempts in 1847 to land in alvarado were checked but the americans then made a plan to land a few miles south of veracruz which surrendered after a 20-day siege defeated general santa anna's forces at the battle of cerro gordo and marched inland through xalapa towards mexico city led by general winfield scott {15]{18] mexico surrendered shortly afterthe municipalities of tuxpan and chicontepec belonged to puebla until 1853 when they were annexed to veracruz to give the state its final form in 1855 the state government palace was constructed during the reform war the major player was ignacio de la llave whose name is part of the state's official designation in 1858 the port became the site for the liberal government under benito juxc3xa1rez after he was forced out of mexico city during the reform war their control of this port and its customs duties allowed liberal forces to gather resources conservative forces attacked the state but were repelled from both the port and xalapa{18]the reform war wrecked mexico's economy and it found itself unable to pay debts it owed to europe as a result juxc3xa1rez cancelled mexico's foreign debt spain britain and france all outraged by this action decided in october 1861 to force repayment of their loans by the occupation of the mexican gulf coast normally this move would have been blocked by the united states under the monroe doctrine however that nation was occupied with a civil war at the time and the european powers believed that the americans could not act in december spanish troops commanded by general manuel gasset occupied the port of veracruz without any local resistance{22] followed a month later by french and british forces the spanish and the british withdrew after making deals with juxc3xa1rez but the french pushed on to establish the reign of maximilian i of mexico however this was short-lived and the french were expelled through veracruz in 186667{15]in 1863 the state was officially named veracruz-llave after the french were expelled the state government was in the port of veracruz in 1878 the capital was transferred to orizaba it was later moved to xalapa in 1885{18]by the end of the century many infrastructure improvements such as roads and railways (especially the ferrocarril interocexc3xa1nico) had been completed with the major cities being veracruz orizaba xalapa cxc3xb3rdoba jalacingo chicontepec and tantoyuca the discovery of oil in the north of the state attracted foreign firms which brought machinery needed for its extraction these companies included huasteca company petroleum and el aguila along with american and english firms during the same time period uprisings against the government under porfirio dxc3xadaz in the agricultural south of the state were brutally repressed{18]20th century to the present{edit]unrest against the dxc3xadaz regime continued until the outbreak of the mexican revolution ousted him from power the major event leading up to this war in veracruz was the cigar-makers strike of 1905 when more than 5000 workers of the "el valle nacional" company walked off the job the governor teodora a dehesa unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a settlement the strike went on for months until the strikers won this victory encouraged more actions until strikes at the factories in rio blanco nogales santa rosa and contxc3xb3n de orizaba resulted in dramatic violence in january 1907{18] no major battles of the mexican revolution were fought in the state though there were skirmishes and attacks on the port by 1914 rebel cxc3xa1ndido agular occupied a number of municipalities in the state and in 1917 venustiano carranza transferred the federal government here temporarily{18]on april 21 1914 an incident involving us sailors in tampico led president woodrow wilson to land american troops in veracruz where they remained for six months mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations{15]after the revolution agrarian reform including the redistribution of land and the creation of ejidos took place here the oil companies in the north of the state were nationalized and consolidated into pemex in the 1930s by lxc3xa1zaro cxc3xa1rdenas in the 1950s more road construction such as the mexico city- poza rica veracruz-alvarado- coatzacoalco and tinajas-ciudad aleman-tlacoatalpan highways were constructed the universidad veracruzana was expanded as well in 1960 the museum of anthropology in xalapa was inaugurated as well as the coatzacoalco-salina cruz highway the veracruz city international airport was opened in the 1970s{18]economy{edit]veracruz has one of mexicoxe2x80x99s leading economies based on agriculture and petroleum{14] using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant 30 of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an i-statistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000 by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues{23]agriculture{edit]vanilla beansthe primary sector of the economy (agriculture forestry and fishing) has been important since pre-hispanic times and continues to be important both as a source of income as well as culturally the state has abundant rainfall and extremely fertile soils as well as a long coastline and forest containing a wide variety of trees and other plants{15]{24]there is about 1 million hectares of cultivable land half of which is in private hands and 43 is ejido or communal land the rest is occupied by human settlements there are 3620 ejidos parceled out to 270000 ejido members 525 of agricultural land is used for the growing of crops or used as pasture and 431 is forest or rainforest chief agricultural products include coffee vanilla sugarcane tobacco bananas coconuts and vegetables but local farmers depend mainly on corn and beans{14] two corn crops per year are generally produced planted on 644936 hectares with a production of 1114325 tons the state is the leading national producer of coffee sugarcane corn and rice{15] coffee is grown on 152993 hectares producing 400575 tons export earnings from this crop are about 232 million usd annually most coffee is grown in the mountain areas of cxc3xb3rdoba-huatusco coatepec-teocelo-cosautlxc3xa1n and misantla-tlapacoyan-atzalan sugarcane is cultivated on 254000 hectares producing 16867958 tons annually veracruz is the largest producer of rice with 24000 hectares producing 120000 tons much is this crop is protected by import bans from asia{citation needed]the state grows half of the countryxe2x80x99s citrus fruit and grows the most kinds this occupies 180577 hectares and produces 2575140 tons annually varieties include oranges tangerines mandarins limes and grapefruit most citrus is grown in the north of the state and much of the lime crop is exported supporting a packing and shipping industry veracruz is the largest mango producer in the country grown on 31640 hectares producing 287000 tons most of this is the manila variety which is preferred in mexico 95 of this crop is consumed fresh within mexico although exports to canada have begun{citation needed] vanilla beans are native to the state which is the primary producer for mexico most of this crop is grown in an area known as totonacapan in and around papantlalivestock raising is an important activity there are over 300000 units of production most of which raise cattle with veracruz being the main beef producer for the country at 14 of the total in addition to beef cattle dairy cattle pigs sheep goats horses domestic fowl and bees are raised{14]from the tropical forests of the inland regions come dyewoods hardwoods and rubber{15] about 20 of the statexe2x80x99s territory is forested with 220000 of temperate forest and 1200000 hectares of tropical forests logging in the state produces 128254 m3 of wood products per year the most exploited species include pine oyamel cypress and oak some tropical hardwoods are harvested as wellveracruzxe2x80x99s long coastline supports a large fishing industry producing one-fifth of mexicoxe2x80x99s catch most of the countryxe2x80x99s mojarra oysters and shrimp come from here other major fish catches include crab sea bass and red snapperagroindustry focuses on the processing of coffee and sugar products with citrus packers holding an important position as well{citation needed]natural resources{edit]petroleum tower in poza ricatoday the state of veracruz rich in natural resources is an important component of mexico's economy approximately 35 of mexico's water supply is found in veracruz there are a number of metallic and non-metallic mineral mining but the most important resource is oil{15]the mountains contain relatively unexploited deposits of gold silver iron and coal although veracruz is an important source of metals such as iron and copper a great deal of its mining involves non-metallic minerals as sulfur silica feldspar calcium kaolin and marble the state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production{13]{15] however mining only accounts for 15 of economic activity for the entire state{15]veracruz was a pioneer in both the extraction and refining of petroleum products{13] the state has about one-fourth of mexicoxe2x80x99s petroleum reserves and ranks third in petroleum production{13]{14] most of this production is concentrated in the northern part of the state{15] approximately 40000000 barrels (6400000xc2xa0m3) of oil are produced each year and 109870000000 cubic feet (3111xc3x97109xc2xa0m3) of natural gas petrochemicals represent 281 of the statexe2x80x99s manufacturing and ranks first nationally there are 22 petrochemical plants with the most important being la cangrejera jxc3xa1ltipan de morelos poza rica cosoleacaque pajaritos and minatitlxc3xa1ngolden lane oil fields{edit]map of the golden lane{25]the "golden lane" ("dos bocas-alamo structure" or the ridge") refers to a series of oil fields aligned in an arc onshore and a symmetrical alignment offshore forming two sides of a cretaceous atoll 180xc2xa0km long{26] the structure was discovered in 1908 by weetman pearson's mexican eagle petroleum company san diego de la mar no 1 well which flowed 2500 bblday{26] the golden lane oil fields penetrate a massive elliptical reef platform identified as the sierra del abra limestone (consisting of reef backreef and lagoonal facies) which dips southeast{27] the site for the discovery well was selected due to the presence of petroleum seeps just as was edward laurence doheny's la paz no well in the ebano-panuco petroleum district west of tampico tamaulipas the first mexican discovery well in 1904{28] in 1908 the infamous dos bocas oil fire occurred after the san diego de la mar no 3 blowout{29] this was followed by the potrero del llano no 4 well flowing 100000 bbl per day during the three months it was out of control{29] doheny's cerro azul no 4 well located by ezequiel ordonez became the largest daily production record holder in 1916 at 260000 bbl{29] geophysical studies in particular gravimetry starting in 1920 led to the discovery of the poza rica field in 1932 and moralillo field in 1948 on the west flank of the golden lane in the tamabra forereef facies{30] refraction seismography surveys started in 1930 augemented in 1948 with reflection seismography which led to the discovery of the southern extent of the atoll with the ezequiel ordonez no 1 well in 1952 and additional discoveries through 1968{31] marine seismic and magnetometer surveys starting in 1957 showed the extent of the atoll offshore and led to the first offshore well isla de lobos no 1-b in 1963{31] the depths of wells are on the order of 500 m onshore and 2000 m offshore{32]industry transportation and commerce{edit]laguna verde nuclear power plant (lvnpp) in alto lucero veracruz produces about 45 of mexico's electrical energya portion of the port of veracruzthe manufacturing industry in veracruz accounts for between 21 and one-third of the state's gross domestic product and approximately 64 of the manufacturing industry gdp is generated by the chemical and petrochemical sectors{15] other products produced include metals processed foods beverages printing and publishing textiles and machinery{15] most of the state's industry takes place in the municipalities of coatzacoalcos minatitlxc3xa1n cosoleacaque poza rica cxc3xb3rdoba orizaba tuxpan and veracruz with over 5000 establishments the rest is divided among nearly 11000 smaller establishments there are five major industrial parks: bruno pagliai ixtac petroquimico morelos cxc3xb3rdoba-amatlxc3xa1n and parque 2000 the largest of these is bruno pagliai which covers 3008 hectarestransportation and commerce are important factors in the state mostly linked to importing and exporting through its four deepwater ports the focus of most of these activities is the port of veracruz it has the most favored position on mexicoxe2x80x99s gulf coast and is extensively used for exports to the united states latin america and europe seventy-five percent of all port activity in mexico takes place in veracruz the chief exports of this state are coffee fresh fruits fertilizer sugar fish and crustaceans{15] other ports include those in tuxpan and coatzacoalcos most highway rail and air connections link to the port of veracruz and other ports to the south{14] the state has 73 companies that have been classified as high-volume exporters and it is ranked sixth in the country for exports the state contains five major food wholesale markets 146 government sponsored markets about 75000 private stores and 201 supermarkets wholesale vendors focus on agricultural products such as wood livestock and food products the major focal point for international business is the world trade center expover in boca del rxc3xado inaugurated in 1989 the center has facilities to accommodate 5000 people in 7000 m2 an exhibition hall of 12000m2 a business center and parking for over 800 vehiclesin the industrial sector relatively poor municipios are not catching up to relatively rich ones though the latter are not diverging either a policy of encouraging much more domestic andor foreign investment is called for if poorer areas are to prosper and the outflow of residents is to stop{33]handcrafts{edit]in the more rural and indigenous areas of the state a number of handicrafts are still made and sold both to local buyers and to tourists many of these crafts are produced by communities that specialize in one or more types wood furniture and other items are made by the huasteca people mostly using cedar and palm trees the best work comes from the towns of ozulama and castillo de teayo teocelo and monte blanco are known for bamboo furniture and other items musical instruments of wood such as a guitar called xe2x80x9cjaranaxe2x80x9d are constructed in the los tuxtlas area especially in catemaco with flutes made in papantla wooden masks are made in teocelo and items made with the wood of coffee plants are made in misantla coatepec huastusco and xico corn husks are used to make decorative figures often religious in nautla and naranjos de amatlxc3xa1n palm fronds are woven into fans shoes and baskets in jalcomulco ozulama and tlalixcoyan{34]ceramics have been made in almost all parts of veracruz since the olmecs one area known for its work is papantla which also includes life sized representations of folk dancers from the area along with more mundane items of glazed and unglazed pottery minatitlxc3xa1n is known for its production of ceramic cooking utensils which are also popular in the neighboring municipalities of actopan and naolinco san miguel aguasuelos and jalcomulco are known for their white clay wares which include water jars toys nativity scenes bells and more{34]traditional clothing and embroidery can be most easily found in the la huasteca area where elaborately decorated women's blouses can be seen especially in the el higo and tlalixcoyan area in totonacalpan men are still often seen in white shirts and pants with a bag to hold personal items this dress dates back to the early colonial period and had not changed much since then other areas specialize in wool items such as naranjos de amatlxc3xa1n minatilxc3xa1n and the city of veracruz where items such as dresses skirts and jackets these and other textils such as tablecloths and napkins are often decorated with cross-stitch leather items include shoes jackets bags wallets belts and boots and are usually made in the la huasteca region teocolo citlaltxc3xa9petl and naolinco{34]culture{edit]gastronomy{edit]huachinango (red snapper) a la veracruzanathe gastronomy of the state is unique in mexico and mixed spanish indigenous and other influences{35] from the pre-hispanic period the cuisine of the state was unique the staple triumvirate of corn beans and squash was supplemented by tropical fruits vanilla beans and an herb called acuyo or hoja santa another important native contribution is seafood which is featured in many dishes such as arroz a la tumbada and caldo de mariscos (seafood soup){11]after the conquest and during the colonial period many other spices and ingredients were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than in other parts of the country from europe the spanish brought saffron parsley thyme marjoram bay laurel and cilantro as well asian spices such as cloves cinnamon and black pepper the spaniards also brought wheat rice almonds olives and olive oil garlic and capers the latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region huachinango a la veracruzana red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut brought from africa by the portuguese via brazil{11]veracruz cuisine divides into six regions called sotavento centro norte centro sur sierra costa norte and los tuxtlas the sotovento area is in the south of the state and the dishes here are heavily based on rice common dishes include arroz a la tumbada which is rice cooked with seafood or meat and rice with fried bananas seafood dishes are also prominent based mostly on fish and shrimp a common ingredient in dishes is a herb called xe2x80x9choja santaxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9chierba santaxe2x80x9d which is a plant of the piperaceae family the centro norte is centered on xalapa dishes here tend to be more indigenous in nature heavily flavored with mild chili peppers common dishes here include chilehuates similar to a tamale stuffed chile peppers and enchiladas less seafood and more pork and domestic fowl are consumed the centro sur area is mostly indigenous and encompasses the area of huatusco coscomatepec cotaxtla orizaba amatlxc3xa1n huilango y las espaxc3xb1olas cxc3xb3rdoba y fortxc3xadn de las flores la negra yanga and san lorenzo de los negros dishes here are similar to centro norte but chayotes appear more often as this region is a major producer of the vegetable meats in adobo sauce are common as well the sierra and costa norte encompass the northern part of the state such as the pxc3xa1nuco river area and totonacapan this area is noted for a number of unique dishes such as frijoles en achuchutl made with black beans pork rind chayotes squash seeds and jalapexc3xb1o peppers

one last one is called los negritos (the little black ones) which was created by african slaves according to tradition the origin of this dance lies in a story about a boy who was bitten by a snake and the rituals his family held to heal him{37]however the statexe2x80x99s most famous dance is as much a ritual and daredevil act as movements performed to music the danza de los voladores (dance of the flyers) is a ceremonyritual which has its roots in the pre-hispanic period and presently best known as associated with the town of papantla veracruz it is believed to have originated with the nahua huastec and otomi peoples in central mexico and then spread throughout most of mesoamerica the ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground the fifth remains on top of the pole dancing and playing a flute and drum according to myth the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought although the ritual did not originate with the totonac people today it is most strongly associated with them especially those in and around papantla as the ceremony has died off in most other places{38] the ceremony was named an intangible cultural heritage by unesco in order to help the ritual survive and thrive in the modern world{39]the state's best-known musical style is called the "son" a xe2x80x9csonxe2x80x9d is a musical variation which traces its origins to spain and developed during the 17th and 18th centuries it is the statexe2x80x99s most
