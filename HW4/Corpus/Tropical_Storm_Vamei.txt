some agencies classify it as a typhoon based on sustained winds of 140xc2xa0kmh (85xc2xa0mph) and the appearance of an eye the storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern peninsular malaysia causing 36xc2xa0million in damage (2001xc2xa0usd 487xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) and five deathscontents1 meteorological history11 unusual formation2 preparations and impact3 see also4 references5 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon december 19 a small low-level circulation was located along the northwest coastline of borneo; at the same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the south china sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the far east the vortex drifted southwestward reaching open water by december 21 the northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation and at the same time a portion of the air surge crossed the equator the southerly flow turned eastward then northward and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation just a short distance north of the equator{1] by december 25 an area of scattered convection persisted about 370xc2xa0km (230xc2xa0mi) east of singapore within an area of low wind shear in association with the low-level circulation continuing slowly westward the convection deepened and organized further{2] and at 1200xc2xa0utc on december 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230xc2xa0km (145xc2xa0mi) east of singapore or 156xc2xa0km (97xc2xa0mi) north of the equator{3] this was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator{1]the depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 0000xc2xa0utc on december 27 based on the analysis by the japan meteorological agency (jma){3] though the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior shortly thereafter an eye with a 39xc2xa0km (24xc2xa0mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery along with rainbands extending southward to the opposite side of the equator at 0600xc2xa0utc the jma first classified the system as tropical storm vamei about 65xc2xa0km (40xc2xa0mi) northeast of singapore{2] and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85xc2xa0kmh (50xc2xa0mph) at the same time{3] however the jtwc upgraded vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140xc2xa0kmh (85xc2xa0mph) based on a united states navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195xc2xa0kmh (120xc2xa0mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall the storm was small and compact with gales extending about 45xc2xa0km (30xc2xa0mi) from its center at about 0830xc2xa0utc on december 27 vamei made landfall approximately 60xc2xa0km (35xc2xa0mi) northeast of singapore{2] in the southeastern portion of the malaysian state of johor{4] initially the malaysian meteorological department (metmalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm{5] though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall{6]tropical storm vamei weakened quickly as it crossed the extreme southern portion of the malay peninsula and late on december 27 the jma downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the straits of malacca{3] the jtwc initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land{2] early on december 28 vamei moved ashore along northeastern sumatra and at 0600xc2xa0utc the jma classified the storm as dissipated{3] however convection persisted near the circulation over land believed to have been caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence on december 29 what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern bay of bengal in a post-season re-evaluation the jtwc classified the system as a continuation of vamei based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of vamei crossed sumatra without dissipating convection re-developed and late on december 30 the jtwc classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390xc2xa0km (245xc2xa0mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of sumatra; initially due to being treated as a separate system it was classified as tropical cyclonexc2xa005b vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization though increased wind shear on december 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day the center was exposed from the deep convection and vamei quickly dissipated{2]unusual formation{edit]trmm image of vamei near landfallvamei formed and reached tropical storm strength at 15xc2xbaxc2xa0n only 156xc2xa0km (97xc2xa0mi) from the equator{3] this broke the previous record of typhoon sarah in the 1956 pacific typhoon season which reached tropical storm strength at 22xc2xbaxc2xa0n{2] due to a lack of coriolis effect near the equator the formation of vamei was previously considered impossible{2] however a study by the naval postgraduate school indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries{1]vamei developed in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography often the vortex remains near the coastline and in an analysis of 51xc2xa0winters only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more as the area in the south china sea between borneo and singapore is only 665xc2xa0km (415xc2xa0mi) wide a vortex needs to move slowly to develop a persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days which is needed to enhance the vortex is present on average nine days each winter the probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10xe2x80x9330xc2xa0percent thus the conditions which resulted in the formation of vamei are believed to occur once every 100xe2x80x93400xc2xa0years{1]preparations and impact{edit]radar image of vamei from ussxc2xa0carl vinsonxc2xa0(cvn-70)four days prior to vamei moving ashore the malaysian meteorological department (metmalaysia) issued storm advisories for potentially affected areas subsequently the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall high winds and rough seas{4] however few citizens knew of the passage of the rare storm{7]offshore of malaysia two us navy ships in vamei's eyewall were damaged by strong winds{1] upon moving ashore the storm brought storm surge damage to portions of southeastern peninsular malaysia{8] vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of melaka negeri sembilan and selangor as well as to johor where rainfall reached over 200xc2xa0mm (8xc2xa0in) in senai additionally monsoonal moisture influenced by the storm produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular malaysia{4] the passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides which forced the evacuation of more than 13195xc2xa0people in johor and pahang states into 69xc2xa0shelters{9]{10] along gunung pulai the rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people river flooding was also reported as a result of the precipitation from vamei as well as previous rainfall damage from the flooding was estimated at rm137xc2xa0million (2001xc2xa0myr 36xc2xa0million 2001xc2xa0usd) about 40xc2xa0percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in kota tinggi moderate damage to transportation education and health-care facilities was also reported the malaysian government provided affected families up to rm5000 (2001xc2xa0myr 1300 2001xc2xa0usd) in assistance for food clothing and repairs{10] vamei also brought heavy rainfall to singapore{11] which caused air traffic disruptions at the singapore changi airport{12] the passage of the cyclone resulted in many downed trees{13]in 2004 the name "vamei" was retired and replaced with "peipah" becoming the first retired name since the japan meteorological agency began naming pacific typhoons in 2000 vamei was one of four tropical cyclones in the current naming list that was retired without attaining typhoon status;
