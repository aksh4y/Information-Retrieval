indicates that japan was inhabited as early as the upper paleolithic period the first written mention of japan is in chinese history texts from the 1st century ad influence from other regions mainly china followed by periods of isolation particularly from western europe has characterized japan's historyfrom the 12th century until 1868 japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the emperor japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century which was ended in 1853 when a united states fleet pressured japan to open to the west after nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection the imperial court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from chxc5x8dshxc5xab and satsumaxe2x80x94and the empire of japan was established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries victories in the first sino-japanese war the russo-japanese war and world war i allowed japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism the second sino-japanese war of 1937 expanded into part of world war ii in 1941 which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and the japanese surrender since adopting its revised constitution on may 3 1947 during the occupation by the scap japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an emperor and

means "the origin of the sun" the character nichi (xe6x97xa5) means "sun" or "day"; hon (xe6x9cxac) means "base" or "origin"{24] the compound therefore means "origin of the sun" and is the source of the popular western epithet "land of the rising sun"{25]the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country this name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty prince shxc5x8dtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself "the emperor of the land where the sun rises" (xe6x97xa5xe5x87xbaxe8x99x95xe5xa4xa9xe5xadx90) the message said: "here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets how are you"the "king of na gold seal" said to have been granted to na king of wa (japan) by emperor guangwu of han in 57 ce the seal reads "xe6xbcxa2xe5xa7x94xe5xa5xb4xe5x9cx8bxe7x8ex8b" tokyo national museumprior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato (xe5xa4xa7xe5x92x8c or "great wa") and wakoku (xe5x80xadxe5x9bxbd) were used the term wa (xe5x92x8c) is a homophone of wo xe5x80xad (pronounced "wa" by the japanese) which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period{26] however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa xe5x80xad (which has been associated in china with concepts like "dwarf" or "pygmy") and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa (xe5x92x8c) meaning "togetherness harmony"{27]{28]the english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxac the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxac japan is zeppen {zxc9x99xcax94pxc9x99n] the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo{29]xe2x80x94and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in south east asia in the 16th century{30] these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe{31] the first record of this name in english is in a book published in 1577 and spelled giapan in a translation of a 1565 letter written by a portuguese jesuit luxc3xads frxc3xb3is{32]{33]from the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku (xe5xa4xa7xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe5xb8x9dxe5x9cx8b) meaning "the empire of great japan"{34] today the name nihon-kokunippon-koku (xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe5x9bxbd) is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the meaning of "the state of japan" countries like japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku (xe5x9bxbd) meaning "country" "nation" or "state"historymain article: history of japanhistory of japanperiodspaleolithicbefore 14000 bcjxc5x8dmon14000 xe2x80x93 300 bcyayoi300 bc xe2x80x93 250

mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture{37] including by ancestors of contemporary ainu people and yamato people{38]{39] decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world around 300 bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jxc5x8dmon{40] the yayoi period starting around 500xc2xa0bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming{41] a new style of pottery{42] and metallurgy introduced from china and korea{43]japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han{44] according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called yamataikoku buddhism was introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince shxc5x8dtoku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china{45] despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period (592xe2x80x93710){46]the nara period (710xe2x80x93784) of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heijxc5x8d-kyxc5x8d (modern nara) the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture{47] the smallpox epidemic of 735xe2x80x93737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan's population{48] in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyxc5x8d then to heian-kyxc5x8d (modern kyoto) in 794this marked the beginning of the heian period (794xe2x80x931185) during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibu's the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan's national anthem "kimigayo" were written during this time{49]buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saichxc5x8d and shingon by kxc5xabkai pure land buddhism (jxc5x8ddo-shxc5xab jxc5x8ddo shinshxc5xab) became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th centuryfeudal erasamurai warriors facing mongols during the mongol invasions of japan; suenaga 1293japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai in 1185 following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shogun by emperor go-toba and yoritomo established a base of power in kamakura after his death the hxc5x8djxc5x8d clan came to power as regents for the shoguns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period (1185xe2x80x931333) and became popular among the samurai class{50] the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336samurais could kill a commoner for the slightest insult and were widely feared by the japanese population edo period 1798ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period (1336xe2x80x931573) the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism ( the art of miyabi) prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyxc5x8ds) and a civil war (the xc5x8cnin war) began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period ("warring states"){51]during the 16th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyxc5x8ds his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchixe2x80x93momoyama period (1573xe2x80x931603) after nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by akechi mitsuhide his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support when open war broke out ieyasu defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in 1600 tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shogun by emperor go-yxc5x8dzei in 1603 and established the tokugawa shogunate in edo (modern tokyo){52] the tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyxc5x8ds;{53] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period (1603xe2x80x931868){54] the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku ("national studies") the study of japan by the japanese{55]modern eraemperor meiji (1868xe2x80x931912) in whose name imperial rule was restored at the end of the tokugawa shogunateon march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the "black ships" of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shogun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the meiji restoration){56]plunging itself through an active process of westernization during the meiji restoration in 1868 japan adopted western political judicial and military institutions and western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence after victories in the first sino-japanese war (1894xe2x80x931895) and the russo-japanese war (1904xe2x80x931905) japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin{57] japan's population grew from

allies to widen its influence and territorial holdings in asia the early 20th century saw a brief period of "taishxc5x8d democracy (1912xe2x80x931926)" but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups the subsequent "shxc5x8dwa period" initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology in 1931 japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation japan resigned from the league of nations in 1933 in 1936 japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the 1940 tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers{59] in 1941 following its defeat in the brief sovietxe2x80x93japanese border war japan negotiated the sovietxe2x80x93japanese neutrality pact{60] which lasted until 1945 with the soviet invasion of manchuria{61]japanese officials surrendering to the allies on september 2 1945 in tokyo bay ending world war iithe empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war (1937xe2x80x931945) the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre{62] in 1940 the empire invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan{63] on december 7xe2x80x938 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the united states and the united kingdom into world war ii in the pacific{64]{65] after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15{66] the war cost japan its colonies china and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies (led by the united states) repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories{67] the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some japanese leaders for war crimes however the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the supreme commander for the allied powers despite calls for the trial of both groups{68]in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952{69] and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery{70] on march 11 2011 japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history; this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power{71]geographymain articles: geography of japan and geology of japanjapanese archipelago as seen from

longitudes 122xc2xb0 and 146xc2xb0e the main islands from north to south are hokkaido honshu shikoku and kyushu the ryukyu islands which include okinawa are a chain to the south of kyushu together they are often known as the japanese archipelago{72]about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use{8]{73] as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world{74]the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago{75]japan has 108 active volcanoes during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged including shxc5x8dwa-shinzan on hokkaido and myxc5x8djin-shxc5x8d off the bayonnaise rocks in the pacific destructive earthquakes often resulting in tsunami occur several times each century{76] the 1923 tokyo earthquake killed over 140000 people{77] more recent major quakes are the 1995 great hanshin earthquake and the 2011 txc5x8dhoku earthquake a 91-magnitude{78] quake which hit japan on march 11 2011 and triggered a large tsunami{71] japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific ring of fire{79] it has the 15th highest natural disaster risk

principal climatic zones: hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryukyu islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter{81]in the sea of japan zone on honshu's west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the chxc5xabgoku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round{81]the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season{81]the average winter temperature in japan is 51xc2xa0xc2xb0c (412xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and the average summer temperature is 252xc2xa0xc2xb0c (774xc2xa0xc2xb0f){82]

japanin the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970{90] the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient
