primarily related to tropical storm force winds across much of the state hurricane isabel formed from a tropical wave on september 6 2003 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165xc2xa0mph (265xc2xa0kmh) on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next dayon september 19 tropical storm isabel passed through southwestern pennsylvania though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout much of the state{1] the passage of hurricane isabel resulted in 160xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 187xc2xa0million 2008xc2xa0usd) and two indirect deaths in pennsylvania{1] one person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages{2] moderate winds left about 14xc2xa0million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the treescontents1 preparations2 impact3 aftermath4 see also5 referencespreparations{edit]while over the western atlantic ocean as a major hurricane forecasters predicted isabel would pass through the central portion of the state{3] successive forecasts shifted the track slightly further to the west though its track into ohio was not anticipated hours before it entered the state the national hurricane center continued to predict isabel would traverse the entire length of the state from south to north and later entering new york before crossing lake ontario into canada{4] around 3 of those who evacuated in north carolina and in the eastern shore of virginia stayed in pennsylvania during the storm{5] the threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out of the state to compensate delta air lines allowed those flying to or from philadelphia allentown and harrisburg to reschedule to a later date american airlines offered a similar option united airlines and united express opted to waive charging fees for travelers in and out of the state{6]prior to the arrival of isabel governor ed rendell declared a state of emergency for the state{7] the pennsylvania emergency management agency activated a support team to assist urban search and rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm the state's national guard placed 2990xc2xa0guardsmen on emergency condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators heavy trucks water trailers and engineer equipment for deployment state police officers were readied for deployment while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition the state environmental protection agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams water treatment facilities and nuclear plants in addition the pennsylvania turnpike commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage{8] prior to the arrival of the storm officials from peco energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1500xc2xa0workers including employees from commonwealth edison in illinois and detroit edison{9]impact{edit]upon making landfall isabel produced a storm surge that tracked up the delaware river with a station along the river in philadelphia reporting a storm tide of 947xc2xa0feet (289xc2xa0m) there the surge flooded low-lying areas along the river{10] the large circulation of the hurricane produced moderate winds throughout the state with wind gusts in the southeastern portion of the state reaching 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) in forks township philadelphia pennsylvania also recorded a wind gust of 49xc2xa0mph (79xc2xa0kmh){11] which contributed to severe delays at the philadelphia international airport{12] the moderate wind gust downed thousands of trees tree limbs and power lines peco energy reported their worst power outage on record with about 572425xc2xa0customers losing electricity the company estimated it would cost at least 20xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 23xc2xa0million 2008xc2xa0usd) for it to install about 81xc2xa0miles (130xc2xa0km) of new cable and install about 7600xc2xa0new fuses and circuit breakers the metropolitan edison power company reported 300000xc2xa0customers without power with 500000xc2xa0pennsylvania power and light

county the combination of the wind gusts and moist grounds from previous rainfalls resulted in hundreds of downed tree limbs{14] primarily in dauphin and lancaster counties{15] lancaster county reportedly suffered the worst wind damage since hurricane hazel in 1954{16]the falling trees downed power lines and poles causing power outages and some property damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses one indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree{14] two other vehicles in franklin county and a fire truck in york were hit and greatly damaged by trees downed
