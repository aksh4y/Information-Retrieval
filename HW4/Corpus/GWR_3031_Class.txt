the existing valves were directly driven from eccentrics mounted on the driving axle and there was insufficient clearance to fit larger eccentrics{9] churchward considered rebuilding the class as armstrong class 4-4-0s with 7xc2xa0ft 2xc2xa0in (2184xc2xa0m) coupled wheels the cylinder centre line would then be 35xc2xa0in (89xc2xa0mm) above the driving centre due to the 7xc2xa0in (178xc2xa0mm) difference in driving wheel diameter this scheme was not carried through because the connecting rods would not clear the lower slide bar and the valve gear would be out of alignment an alternative proposal to drop the locomotive 35xc2xa0in (89xc2xa0mm) and raise the buffer beam and dragbox was also rejected on the grounds of cost the class were gradually withdrawn between 1908 and 1915 with the last survivor no 3074 princess helena being withdrawn in december 1916{9]contents1 notable members of the class2 replica3 numbering4 models5 civic heraldry6 notes7 references8 external linksnotable members of the class{edit]3065 duke of connaught made a record-breaking run with the ocean mail on 9 may 1904 covering the distance from bristol (pylle hill) to paddington in 99 minutes 46 seconds{10] as part of a run from plymouth to paddington in 227 minutes3041 the queen originally named james mason was an example of this class allocated to royal train dutiesnumber 3046 lord of the isles has enjoyed a certain amount of celebrity having been chosen as the prototype for a tri-ang model locomotive since then the engine has also been modelled by brio and matchbox in 2006 hornby also produced a limited edition of the same model this time bearing the name lorna doonereplica{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (october 2011) (learn how and when to remove this template message)the replica no 3041 in 1982none of the original class survive but a static replica of the queen was commissioned by tussauds for the railways and royalty exhibition at windsor and eton central railway station the replica loco was completed in december 1982 and displayed outside steamtown in january 1983 (where it was constructed) before being transported by road to windsor on 12 january 1983 and arriving on 14 january the main frames footplate 'boiler' smokebox cab and splashers were fabricated by babcock's of tipton the tender was modified from an lbscr c2x tender parts from a gwr tender that came from the dumbleton hall preservation society were used to provide the wheels for the front bogie and the real wheels the top halves of the driving wheels do not exist and were cast from 2 quarters being bolted together to make a half and the driving wheels also don't sit on the rail so the loco could be wheeled into position on its front bogie and rear wheels some boiler fittings were obtained from the great western society and sandblasted and the dome and safety valve bonnet were made by newcastle metal spinners tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so steam was emitted from the cab whistles safety valves and smoke from the chimney a sound unit was also fitted{11]the engine remains there but the tender was scrapped to make more space for the shopping centre occupying that station building the bluebell railway atlantic group purchased the axleboxes springs and the complete wheel sets from the tender for use in their newbuild atlantic projectnumbering{edit]numbernamebuilt4-2-2 rebuildwithdrawndetails and information3001amazon1892-01 !011892101894061908previously the name of a rover class locomotive withdrawn in 1892;
