bibliography17 external linksetymologythe state of hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island hawaixcaxbbi a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawaixcaxbbi is that was named for hawaixcaxbbiloa a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled{12]{13]the hawaiian language word hawaixcaxbbi is very similar to proto-polynesian sawaiki with the reconstructed meaning "homeland"{14] cognates of hawaixcaxbbi are found in other polynesian languages including mxc4x81ori (hawaiki) rarotongan (xcaxbbavaiki) and samoan (savaixcaxbbi)  according to linguists pukui and elbert{15] "{e]lsewhere in polynesia hawaixcaxbbi or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning"{16]spelling of state namea somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the constitution of the state of hawaii added hawaiian as a second official state language{17] the title of the state constitution is the constitution of the state of hawaii articlexc2xa0xv sectionxc2xa01 of the constitution uses the state of hawaii{18] diacritics were not used because the document drafted in 1949{19] predates the use of the okina (xcaxbb) and the kahakxc5x8d in modern hawaiian orthography the exact spelling of the state's name in the hawaiian language is hawaixcaxbbi{b] in the hawaii admission act that granted hawaiian statehood the federal government recognized hawaii as the official state name official government publications department and office titles and the seal of hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length{20] in contrast the national and state parks services the university of hawaixcaxbbi and some private enterprises implement these symbols no precedent for changes to us state names exists since the adoption of the united states constitution in 1789 however the constitution of massachusetts formally changed the province of massachusetts bay to the commonwealth of massachusetts in 1780 and in 1819 the territory of arkansaw was created but was later admitted to statehood as the state of arkansasgeography and environmentmain article: hawaiian islandsthere are eight main hawaiian islands seven of which are permanently inhabited the island of nixcaxbbihau is privately managed by brothers bruce and keith

the southernmost us state and the second westernmost after alaska hawaii along with alaska does not border any other us state it is the only us state that is not geographically located in north america the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivablein addition to the eight main islands the state has many smaller islands and islets kaxcaxbbula is a small island near nixcaxbbihau the northwest hawaiian islands is a group of nine small older islands to the northwest of kauaxcaxbbi that extend from nihoa to kure atoll; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets such as molokini which are either volcanic marine sedimentary or erosional in origin{32]hawaii's tallest mountain mauna kea is 13796xc2xa0ft (4205xc2xa0m) above mean sea level;{33] it is taller than mount everest if measured from the base of the mountain which lies on the floor of the pacific ocean and rises about 33500 feet (10200xc2xa0m){34]geologymain article: hawaii hotspotpxc4x81hoehoe or smooth lava spills into the pacific ocean forming new rock off the coast of the island of hawaiithe hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the hawaii hotspot the process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the pacific ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary slowly creating new volcanoes because of the hotspot's location all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of hawaii island the newest volcano lxc5x8dxcaxbbihi seamount is located south of the coast of hawaii islandthe last volcanic eruption outside hawaii island occurred at haleakalxc4x81 on maui before the late 18thxc2xa0century possibly hundreds of years earlier{35] in 1790 kxc4xablauea exploded; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the united states{36] up to 5405 warriors and their families marching on kxc4xablauea were killed by the eruption{37] volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features hawaii island has the third-highest point among the world's islands{38]on the flanks of the volcanoes slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis particularly in 1868 and 1975{39] steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes{40]{41]flora and faunasee also: endemism in the hawaiian islands and list of invasive plant species in hawaiicorvus hawaiiensis the endemic hawaiian crow (xcaxbbalalxc4x81) is extinct in the wildbecause the islands of hawaii are distant from other land habitats life is thought to have arrived there by wind waves (ie by ocean currents) and wings (ie birds insects and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers) this isolation in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes tropical climates and arid shorelines) produced an array of endemic flora and fauna hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other us state{42] one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct{43] the two species of brighamiaxe2x80x94b rockii and b insignisxe2x80x94are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3000-foot (910xc2xa0m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas{44]the extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10xc2xa0million years; a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there the islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field on a single island the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5100 millimeters per year) through a temperate climate to alpine conditions with a cold dry climate the rainy climate impacts soil development which largely determines ground permeability affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands{citation needed]protected areasfrench frigate shoals located in the northwestern hawaiian islands is protected

hawaii tornadoes and climate of hawaiia true-color satellite view of hawaii shows that most of the vegetation on the islands grows on the northeast sides which face the wind the silver glow around the southwest of the islands is the result of calmer waters{47]hawaii's climate is typical for the tropics although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east summer highs usually reach around 88xc2xa0xc2xb0f (31xc2xa0xc2xb0c) during the day with the temperature reaching a low of 75xc2xa0xc2xb0f (24xc2xa0xc2xb0c) at night winter day temperatures are usually around 83xc2xa0xc2xb0f (28xc2xa0xc2xb0c); at low elevation they seldom dip below 65xc2xa0xc2xb0f (18xc2xa0xc2xb0c) at night snow not usually associated with the tropics falls

average annual rainfall on earth about 460 inches (12000xc2xa0mm) per year most of hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from may to october and the wet season is from october to april{48]the warmest temperature recorded in the state in pahala on april 27 1931 is 100xc2xa0xc2xb0f (38xc2xa0xc2xb0c) making it tied with alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a

the marquesas islands a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th century the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic debate{52] some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000 ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs the kapu system the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiau{citation needed] this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology (moxcaxbbolelo) about paxcaxbbao other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that paxcaxbbao must be regarded as a myth{citation needed]the history of the islands is marked by a slow steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms which grew to encompass whole islands local chiefs called alixcaxbbi ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals ancient hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of hindus in india{53]european arrivalkalanixcaxbbxc5x8dpuxcaxbbu king of hawaixcaxbbi brings presents to captain cookit is

a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542 bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot depending on the interpretation gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either hawaixcaxbbi or the marshall islands{54]{55]{betterxc2xa0sourcexc2xa0needed] if de villalobos' crew spotted hawaixcaxbbi gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility{56]{57]spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawaixcaxbbi but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands in this manuscript the island of maui is named la desgraciada (the unfortunate island) and what appears to be hawaixcaxbbi island is named la mesa (the table) islands resembling kahoolawe lanai and molokai are named los monjes (the monks){58] for two-and-a-half centuries spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawaixcaxbbi on their way to manila the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powersthe 1778 arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu 4th earl of sandwich cook published the islands' location and rendered the native name as owyhee this spelling lives on in owyhee county idaho it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area the owyhee mountains were also named for them{59]king kamehameha receiving otto von kotzebue's russian naval expedition drawing by louis choris in 1816cook visited the hawaiian islands twice as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779 a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as "firewood"{60] and a minor chief and his men took a ship's boat cook abducted the king of hawaixcaxbbi island kalanixcaxbbxc5x8dpuxcaxbbu and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cook's boat this tactic had worked in tahiti and other islands{61] instead kalanixcaxbbxc5x8dpuxcaxbbu's supporters fought back killing cook and four marines as cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship they departed without the ship's boatafter cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors: explorers traders and eventually whalers who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawaixcaxbbi which bears the union jack in the top-left corner these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands causing the hawaiian population to drop precipitously{62] native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles by 1820 disease famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian population{63] during the 1850s measles killed a fifth of hawaii's people{64]historical records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province; a few sailors arrived in 1778 with captain cook's journey and more arrived in 1789 with an american trader who settled in hawaii in the late 18th century it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830; as with the other new infectious diseases it proved damaging to the hawaiians{citation needed]kingdom of

kamehameha a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872{65]after kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819 american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people{66]{67] during the reign of king kamehameha iii hawai'i turned into a christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840 constitution{68] hiram bingham i a prominent protestant missionary was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american subjects{69] catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian population{70]{71]{72] missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on molokaxcaxbbi which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century the best

of california (us602000){155]hawaii's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic us government trade policy like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year such as areas of california arizona and florida hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a "sunshine tax" this situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well the situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in hawaii a us trade law known as the jones act or the merchant marine act of 1920 this trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american portsxe2x80x94a practice known as cabotage most consumer goods in the united states are manufactured by outsourced labor in east asia then transported by container ships to ports on the us mainland and hawaii also receives the same goods being located in the central pacific ocean right between major pacific shipping lanes it would be very economical to unload hawaiian-bound goods in honolulu before continuing on to the mainland however this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two american ports because most large cargo ships operate under foreign "flags of convenience" such as liberia vanuatu or papua new guinea allowing them to avoid the more stringent and thus more costly regulations of developed nations' ports the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the jones act instead those cargo ships must proceed directly to the west coast where distributors break bulk and transport the hawaiian-bound asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by us-flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 this highly inefficient system of shipping hawaii's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average hawaiian citizen and makes the cost of living in hawaii much much higher than it would otherwise be{156]{157]hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan even though prices for asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to asia{158]{159]culturemain article: culture of the native hawaiiansthe aboriginal culture of hawaii is polynesian hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast

organizations seeking some form of sovereignty for hawaii have been active since the 1880s generally their focus is on self-determination and self-governance either for hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals for "hawaiian nationals" descended from subjects of the hawaiian kingdom or declaring themselves as such by choice) or for people of whole or part native hawaiian ancestry in an indigenous "nation to nation" relationship akin to tribal sovereignty with us federal recognition of native hawaiians a 2005 grassroot institute poll found the majority of hawaiian residents opposed the akaka bill{200]the hawaiian sovereignty movement which generally views the overthrow of kingdom of hawaii in 1893 and its subsequent annexation by the united states as illegal seeks some form of greater autonomy for hawaii such as free association or independence from the united states{201]{202]{203]{204] some groups also advocate some form of redress from the united states for the 1893 overthrow of queen lilixcaxbbuokalani and for what is described as a prolonged military occupation beginning with the 1898 annexation the apology resolution passed by us congress in 1993 cited as a major impetus by the movement for hawaiian sovereignty{201] the sovereignty movement considers hawaii to be an illegally occupied nation{202]{205]{206]gallery of satellite views and landmarksislands
