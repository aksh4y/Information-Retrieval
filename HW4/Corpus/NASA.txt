administration (nasa xcbx88nxc3xa6sxc9x99) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the united states federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research{note 1]president dwight d eisenhower established nasa in 1958{10] with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science the national aeronautics and space act was passed on july 29 1958 disestablishing nasa's predecessor the national advisory committee for aeronautics (naca) the new agency became operational on october 1 1958{11]{12]since that time most us space exploration efforts have been led by nasa including the apollo moon landing missions the skylab space station and later the space shuttle currently nasa is supporting the international space station and is overseeing the development of the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle the space launch system and commercial crew vehicles the agency is also responsible for the launch services program (lsp) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned nasa launchesnasa science is focused on better understanding earth through the earth observing system{13] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the science mission directorate's heliophysics research program{14] exploring bodies throughout the solar system with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as new horizons{15] and researching astrophysics topics such as the big bang through the great observatories and associated programs{16] nasa shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the greenhouse gases observing satellite since 2011 nasa has been criticized for low cost efficiency achieving little results in return for high development costs{17]{18]{19]contents1 creation2 staff and leadership3 nasa advisory council4 space flight programs41 manned programs411 x-15 rocket plane (1959xe2x80x931968)412

article: creation of nasawilliam h pickering (center) jpl director president john f kennedy (right) nasa administrator james e webb (background) discussing the mariner program with a model presentedfrom 1946 the national advisory committee for aeronautics (naca) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic bell x-1{20] in the early 1950s there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the international geophysical year (1957xe2x80x9358) an effort for this was the american project vanguard after the soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (sputnik 1) on october 4 1957 the attention of the united states turned toward its own fledgling space efforts the us congress alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "sputnik crisis") urged immediate and swift action; president dwight d eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures on january 12 1958 naca organized a "special committee on space technology" headed by guyford stever{12] on january 14 1958 naca director hugh dryden published "a national research program for space technology" stating:{21]it is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge {sputnik] be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space it is accordingly proposed that the scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency naca is capable by rapid extension and expansion of its effort of providing leadership in space technology{21]while this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity the advanced research projects agency (arpa) was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application{22]on july 29 1958 eisenhower signed the national aeronautics and space act establishing nasa when it began operations on october 1 1958 nasa absorbed the 43-year-old naca intact; its 8000 employees an annual budget of us100xc2xa0million three major research laboratories (langley aeronautical laboratory ames aeronautical laboratory and lewis flight propulsion laboratory) and two small test facilities{23] a nasa seal was approved by president eisenhower in 1959{24] elements of the army ballistic missile agency and the united states naval research laboratory were incorporated into nasa a significant contributor to nasa's entry into the space race with the soviet union was the technology from the german rocket program led by wernher von braun who was now working for the army ballistic missile agency (abma) which in turn incorporated the technology of american scientist robert goddard's earlier works{25] earlier research efforts within the us air force{23] and many of arpa's early space programs were also transferred to nasa{26] in december 1958 nasa gained control of the jet propulsion laboratory a contractor facility operated by the california institute of technology{23]staff and leadershipmain article: list of nasa administratorscharles bolden speaks after landing of the last space shuttle mission sts-135the agency's leader nasa's administrator is nominated by the president of the united states subject to approval of the us senate and reports to him or her and serves as senior space science advisor though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan the appointee usually is associated with the president's political party (democratic or republican) and a new administrator is usually chosen when the presidency changes parties the only exceptions to this have been: james c fletcher appointed by republican richard nixon but stayed through may 1977 into the term of democrat jimmy carter; daniel goldin appointed by republican george h w bush and stayed through the administration of democrat bill clinton; and robert m lightfoot jr associate administrator under democrat barack obama kept on as acting administrator by republican donald trump{6] though the agency is independent the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the president{27]the first administrator was dr t keith glennan appointed by republican president dwight d eisenhower during his term he brought together the disparate projects in american space development research{28]the third administrator james e webb (1961xe2x80x931968) appointed by president john f kennedy was a democrat who first publicly served under president harry s truman in order to implement the apollo program to achieve kennedy's moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion establishing the houston manned spacecraft (johnson) center and the florida launch operations (kennedy) center capitalizing on kennedy's legacy president lyndon johnson kept continuity with the apollo program by keeping webb on when he succeeded kennedy in november 1963 but webb resigned in october 1968 before apollo achieved its goal and republican president richard m nixon replaced webb with republican thomas o painejames fletcher was responsible for early planning of the space shuttle program during his first term as administrator under president nixon he was appointed for a second term as administrator from may 1986 through april 1989 by president ronald reagan to help the agency recover from the space shuttle challenger disasterformer astronaut charles bolden served as nasa's twelfth administrator from july 2009 to january 20 2017{29] administrator bolden is one of three former astronauts who became nasa administrators along with richard h truly (served 1989xe2x80x931992) and frederick d gregory (acting 2005)the agency's administration is located at nasa headquarters in washington dc and provides overall guidance and direction{30] except under exceptional circumstances nasa civil service employees are required to be citizens of the united states{31]nasa advisory councilin response to the apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967 congress directed nasa to form an aerospace safety advisory panel (asap) to advise the nasa administrator on safety issues and hazards in nasa's aerospace programs in the aftermath of the shuttle columbia accident congress required that the asap submit an annual report to the nasa administrator and to congress{32] by 1971 nasa had also established the space program advisory council and the research and technology advisory council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support in 1977 the latter two were combined to form the nasa advisory council (nac){33]space flight programsat launch control for the may 28 1964 saturn i sa-6 launch wernher von braun is at centermain article: list of nasa missionsnasa has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history unmanned programs launched the first american artificial satellites into earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system starting with venus and mars and including "grand tours" of the outer planets manned programs sent the first americans into low earth orbit (leo) won the space race with the soviet union by landing twelve men on the moon from 1969 to 1972 in the apollo program developed a semi-reusable leo space shuttle and developed leo space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-soviet russia some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects such as the galileo probe which was deployed by astronauts in earth orbit before being sent unmanned to jupitermanned programsthe experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by naca were extended by nasa as support for manned spaceflight this was followed by a one-man space capsule program and in turn by a two-man capsule program reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the soviet union in 1961 president john f kennedy proposed the ambitious goal "of landing a man on the moon by the end of {the 1960s] and returning him safely to the earth" this goal was met in 1969 by the apollo program and nasa planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to mars however reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans nasa turned its attention to an apollo-derived temporary space laboratory and a semi-reusable earth orbital shuttle in the 1990s funding was approved for nasa to develop a permanent earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community which now included the former rival post-soviet russia to date nasa has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets and thirteen x-15 rocket flights above the usaf definition of spaceflight altitude 260000 feet (80xc2xa0km){34]x-15 rocket plane (1959xe2x80x931968)main article: north american x-15x-15 in powered flightthe x-15 was an naca experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft developed in conjunction with the us air force and navy the design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems{35] requests for proposal were issued on december 30 1954 for the airframe and february 4 1955 for the rocket engine the airframe contract was awarded to north american aviation in november 1955 and the xlr30 engine contract was awarded to reaction motors in 1956 and three planes were built the x-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two nasa boeing b-52 stratofortresses nb52a tail number 52-003 and nb52b tail number 52-008 (known as the balls 8) release took place at an altitude of about 45000 feet (14xc2xa0km) and a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805xc2xa0kmh)twelve pilots were selected for the program from the air force navy and naca (later nasa) a total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968 resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft (current as of 2014{update]) and a maximum speed of mach 672 4519 miles per hour (7273xc2xa0kmh){36] the altitude record for x-15 was 354200 feet (10796xc2xa0km){37] eight of the pilots were awarded air force astronaut wings for flying above 260000 feet (80xc2xa0km) and two flights by joseph a walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330000xc2xa0ft) qualifying as spaceflight according to the international aeronautical federation the x-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft space suits and horizon definition for navigation{37] the reentry and landing data collected were valuable to nasa for designing the space shuttle{35]project mercury (1958xe2x80x931963)main article: project mercuryjohn glenn on friendship 7: first us orbital flight 1962shortly after the space race began an early objective was to get a person into earth orbit as soon as possible therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored the us air force's man in space soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the x-15 to small ballistic space capsules{38] by 1958 the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule{39]when nasa was created that same year the air force program was transferred to it and renamed project mercury the first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the navy air force and marine test pilot programs on may 5 1961 astronaut alan shepard became the first american in space aboard freedomxc2xa07 launched by a redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight{40] john glenn became the first american to be launched into orbit by an atlas launch vehicle on february 20 1962 aboard friendshipxc2xa07{41] glenn completed three orbits after which three more orbital flights were made culminating in l gordon cooper's 22-orbit flight faith 7 may 15xe2x80x9316 1963{42]the soviet union (ussr) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft vostok they sent the first man in space by launching cosmonaut yuri gagarin into a single earth orbit aboard vostok 1 in april 1961 one month before shepard's flight{43] in august 1962 they achieved an almost four-day record flight with andriyan nikolayev aboard vostok 3 and also conducted a concurrent vostok 4 mission carrying pavel popovichproject gemini (1961xe2x80x931966)main article: project geminied white on gemini 4: first us spacewalk 1965based on studies to grow the mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights developing space rendezvous techniques and precision earth landing project gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the soviets' lead and to support the apollo manned lunar landing program adding extravehicular activity (eva) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives the first manned gemini flight gemini 3 was flown by gus grissom and john young on march 23 1965{44] nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966 demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days rendezvous docking and practical eva and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans{45]{46]under the direction of soviet premier nikita khrushchev the ussr competed with gemini by converting their vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man voskhod they succeeded in launching two manned flights before gemini's first flight achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first eva in 1964 after this the program was canceled and gemini caught up while spacecraft designer sergei korolev developed the soyuz spacecraft their answer to apolloapollo program (1961xe2x80x931972)main article: apollo programapollo 11: buzz aldrin on the moon 1969the us public's perception of the soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated president john f kennedy to ask the congress on may 25 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s which effectively launched the apollo program{47]apollo was one of the most expensive american scientific programs ever it cost more than 20 billion in 1960s dollars{48] or an estimated 208xc2xa0billion in present-day us dollars{49] (in comparison the manhattan project cost roughly 266xc2xa0billion accounting for inflation){49]{50] it used the saturn rockets as launch vehicles which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects{51] the spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts the combined command and service module (csm) and the lunar landing module (lm) the lm was to be left on the moon and only the command module (cm) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to earththe second manned mission apollo 8 brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968{52] shortly before the soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the moon{53] on the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the moon landing were practiced{54]{55] and then finally the moon landing was made on the apollo 11 mission in july 1969{56]apollo 17: lrv-003 1972the first person to stand on the moon was neil armstrong who was followed by buzz aldrin while michael collins orbited above five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last in december 1972 throughout these six apollo spaceflights twelve men walked on the moon these missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 3817 kilograms (842xc2xa0lb) of lunar samples topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics meteoroids seismology heat flow lunar ranging magnetic fields and solar wind{57] the moon landing marked the end of the space race; and as a gesture armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the moon{58]apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit and landing humans on another celestial body{59] apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low earth orbit to date the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world notably at the smithsonian's air and space museumsskylab (1965xe2x80x931979)main article: skylabskylab space station 1974skylab was the united states' first and only independently built space station{60] conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent saturn ib upper stage the 169950xc2xa0lb (77088xc2xa0kg) station was constructed on earth and launched on may 14 1973 atop the first two stages of a saturn v into a 235-nautical-mile (435xc2xa0km) orbit inclined at 50xc2xb0 to the equator damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel it was repaired to functionality by its first crew it was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974{60] it included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity and a solar observatory{60] nasa planned to have a space shuttle dock with it and elevate skylab to a higher safe altitude but the shuttle was not ready for flight before skylab's re-entry on july 11 1979{61]to save cost nasa used one of the saturn v rockets originally earmarked for a canceled apollo mission to launch the skylab apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28 59 and 84 days skylab's habitable volume was 11290 cubic feet (320xc2xa0m3) which was 307 times bigger than that of the apollo command module{61]apolloxe2x80x93soyuz test project (1972xe2x80x931975)main article: apolloxe2x80x93soyuz test projectsoviet and american crews with spacecraft model 1975on may 24 1972 us president richard m nixon and soviet premier alexei kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other{62] this authorized the apollo-soyuz test project (astp) involving the rendezvous and docking in earth orbit of a surplus apollo commandservice module with a soyuz spacecraft the mission took place in july 1975 this was the last us manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the space shuttle in april 1981{63]the mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint usxe2x80x93russian space flights such as the shuttlexe2x80x93mir program{64] and the international space stationspace shuttle program (1972xe2x80x932011)main article: space shuttle programlaunch of a space shuttlemae jemison working in spacelab in 1992 spacelab was a major nasa collaboration with europe's space agenciesthe space shuttle became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985 the first to launch columbia did so on april 12 1981{65] the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight{66]its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side the external tank which was bigger than the spacecraft itself was the only major component that was not reused the shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185xe2x80x93643xc2xa0km (115xe2x80x93400 miles){67] and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24400xc2xa0kg (54000xc2xa0lb){68] missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts{67]on 20 missions (1983xe2x80x9398) the space shuttle carried spacelab designed in cooperation with the european space agency (esa) spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight but remained in the shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock{69] another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the hubble space telescope in 1990 and 1993 respectively{70]in 1995 russian-american interaction resumed with the shuttlexe2x80x93mir missions (1995xe2x80x931998) once more an american vehicle docked with a russian craft this time a full-fledged space station this cooperation has continued with russia and the united states as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the international space station (iss) the strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when nasa began relying on russian launch vehicles to service the iss during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 space shuttle columbia disasterthe shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: challenger in 1986 and columbia in 2003{71] while the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the space shuttle endeavour from replacement parts nasa did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss{71] nasa's space shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the space shuttle atlantis at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 the program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space{72]international space station (1993xe2x80x93present)main article: international space stationthe international space station as seen by the final sts missionthe international space station (iss) combines nasa's space station freedom project with the sovietrussian mir-2 station the european columbus station and the japanese kibxc5x8d laboratory module{73] nasa originally planned in the 1980s to develop freedom alone but us budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993 managed by nasa the russian federal space agency (rka) the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) the european space agency (esa) and the canadian space agency (csa){74]{75] the station consists of pressurized modules external trusses solar arrays and other components which have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and the us space shuttles{73] it is currently being assembled in low earth orbit the on-orbit assembly began in 1998 the completion of the us orbital segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the russian orbital segment is expected by 2016{76]{77]{needs update] the ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements{78] which divide the station into two areas and allow russia to retain full ownership of the russian orbital segment (with the exception of zarya){79]{80] with the us orbital segment allocated between the other international partners{78]long duration missions to the iss are referred to as iss expeditions expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the iss{81] the initial expedition crew size was three temporarily decreased to two following the columbia disaster since may 2009 expedition crew size has been six crew members{82] crew size is expected to be increased to seven the number the iss was designed for once the commercial crew program becomes operational{83] the iss has been continuously occupied for the past 7003621800000000000xe2x99xa017xc2xa0years and 9xc2xa0days having exceeded the previous record held by mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations{84]{85]the station can be seen from the earth with the naked eye and as of 2017 is the largest artificial satellite in earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station{86] the soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the iss they are the russian progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000 the european automated transfer vehicle (atv) since 2008 the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle (htv) since 2009 the american dragon spacecraft since 2012 and the american cygnus spacecraft since 2013 the space shuttle before its retirement was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay until another us manned spacecraft is ready crew members will travel to and from the international space station exclusively aboard the soyuz{87] the highest number of people occupying the iss has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late shuttle iss assembly missions{88]the iss program is expected to continue until at least 2020 and may be extended beyond 2028{89]commercial resupply services (2006xe2x80x93present)main article: commercial resupply servicesthe dragon is seen being berthed to the iss in may 2012the standard variant of cygnus is seen berthed to the iss in september 2013the development of the commercial resupply services (crs) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the iss{90] the development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone{91] private companies were also required to have some "skin in the game" which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal{92]on december 23 2008 nasa awarded commercial resupply services contracts to spacex and orbital sciences corporation{93] spacex uses its falcon 9 rocket and dragon spacecraft{94] orbital sciences uses its antares rocket and cygnus spacecraft the first dragon resupply mission occurred in may 2012{95] the first cygnus resupply mission occurred in september 2013{96] the crs program now provides for all america's iss cargo needs; with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the european atv and the japanese htv{97]commercial crew program (2010xe2x80x93present)main article: commercial crew developmentthe commercial crew development (ccdev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the iss staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to earth{98] it is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-nasa customers to private space stations such those planned by bigelow aerospace{99] like cots ccdev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment{91]in 2010 nasa announced the winners of the first phase of the program a total of 50xc2xa0million was divided among five american companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector in 2011 the winners of the second phase of the program were

develop their crew transportation systems{101] in 2014 the winners of the final round were announced{102] spacex's dragon v2 (planned to be launched on a falcon 9 v11) received a contract valued up to 26 billion and boeing's cst-100 (to be launched on an atlas v) received a contract valued up to 42 billion{103] nasa expects these vehicles to begin transporting humans to the iss in 2017{103]dragon

nasa has been directed to develop the space launch system (sls) a saturn-v class rocket and the two to six person beyond low earth orbit spacecraft orion in february 2010 president barack obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the iss to private companies{104] during a speech at the kennedy space center on april 15 2010 obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (hlv) to replace the formerly planned ares v{105] in his speech obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025 and a manned mission to mars orbit by the mid-2030s{105] the nasa authorization act of 2010 was passed by congress and signed into law on october 11 2010{106] the act officially canceled the constellation program{106]the authorization act required a newly designed hlv be chosen within 90 days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name "space launch system" the new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft{107] the orion spacecraft which was being developed as part of the constellation program was chosen to fulfill this role{108] the space launch system is planned to launch both orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low earth orbit{109] the sls is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions the initial capability of sls is required to be able to lift 70 mt into leo it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt{108]{110]exploration flight test 1 (eft-1) an unmanned test flight of orion's crew module was launched on december 5 2014 atop a delta iv heavy rocket{110] exploration mission-1 (em-1) is the unmanned initial launch of sls that would also send orion on a circumlunar trajectory which is planned for 2019{110] the first manned flight of orion and sls exploration mission 2 (em-2) is to launch in 2022; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into lunar orbit{110] em-3 is planned to deliver a crew of 4 to lunar orbit along with the first module of deep space gatewayon june 5 2016 nasa and darpa announced plans to build a series of new x-planes over the next 10 years{111] one of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic vehicle that burns low-carbon biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms{111]nasa plans to build full scale deep space habitats such at the nautilus-x and deep space gateway as part of its next space technologies for exploration partnerships (nextstep) program{112]unmanned programspioneer 3 and 4 launched in 1958 and 1959 respectivelyjwst main mirror assembled november 2016main article: unmanned nasa missionsmore than 1000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system{113] besides exploration communication satellites have also been launched by nasa{114] the missions have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles which could either deploy the satellite itself or with a rocket stage to take it fartherthe first us unmanned satellite was explorer 1 which started as an abmajpl project during the early part of the space race it was launched in january 1958 two months after sputnik at the creation of nasa the explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind among other aspects{115] a more recent earth mission not related to the explorer program was the hubble space telescope which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990{116]the inner solar system has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs the first was mariner in the 1960s and '70s which made multiple visits to venus and mars and one to mercury probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (mariner 2) to take the first pictures from another planet (mariner 4) the first planetary orbiter (mariner 9) and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (mariner 10) this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination{117]the first successful landing on mars was made by viking 1 in 1976 twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by mars pathfinder{118]outside mars jupiter was first visited by pioneer 10 in 1973 more than 20 years later galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet{119] pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit saturn in 1979 with voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to uranus and neptune in 1986 and 1989 respectively the first spacecraft to leave the solar system was pioneer 10 in 1983 for a time it was the most distant spacecraft but it has since been surpassed by both voyager 1 and voyager 2{120]pioneers 10 and 11 and both voyager probes carry messages from the earth to extraterrestrial life{121]{122] communication can be difficult with deep space travel for instance it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the new horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to pluto{123] contact with pioneer 10 was lost in 2003 both voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the solar system and interstellar space{124]on november 26 2011 nasa's mars science laboratory mission was successfully launched for mars curiosity successfully landed on mars on august 6 2012 and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on mars{125]{126]{127]recent and planned activitiesnasa's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of mars (mars 2020 and insight) and saturn and studies of the earth and the sun other active spacecraft missions are juno for jupiter new horizons (for jupiter pluto and beyond) and dawn for the asteroid belt nasa continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt including pioneer and voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-pluto region and gas giant orbiters galileo (1989xe2x80x932003) cassini(1997xe2x80x932017) and juno (2011xe2x80x93)the new horizons mission to pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of pluto on july 14 2015 the probe received a gravity assist from jupiter in february 2007 examining some of jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby on the horizon of nasa's plans is the maven spacecraft as part of the mars scout program to study the atmosphere of mars{128]vision mission for an interstellar precursor spacecraft by nasaon december 4 2006 nasa announced it was planning a permanent moon base{129] the goal was to start building the moon base by 2020 and by 2024 have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization however in 2009 the augustine committee found the program to be on an "unsustainable trajectory"{130] in 2010 president barack obama halted existing plans including the moon base and directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and mars as well as extending support for the international space station{131]since 2011 nasa's strategic goals have been{132]extend and sustain human activities across the solar systemexpand scientific understanding of the earth and the universecreate innovative

astronaut planting a us flag on mars a manned mission to mars has been discussed as a possible nasa mission since the 1960smain article: budget of nasanasa's budget has generally been approximately 1 of the federal budget from the early 1970s on after briefly peaking at approximately 441 in 1966 during the apollo program{27]{147] public perception of nasa's budget has differed significantly from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that most americans responded that 20 of the federal budget went to nasa{148]the percentage of federal budget that nasa has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at 048 of the federal budget{149] in a march 2012 meeting of the united states senate science committee neil degrasse tyson testified that "right

earth's atmosphere and in space can adversely effect the earth's environment some hypergolic rocket propellants such as hydrazine are highly toxic prior to combustion but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning rockets using hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust{153] however carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average the united states consumed 802620000 us gallons (30382xc3x97109xc2xa0l) gallons of liquid fuels per day in 2014 while a single falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25000 us gallons (95000xc2xa0l) of kerosene fuel per launch{154]{155] even if a falcon 9 were launched every single day it would only represent 0006 of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day additionally the exhaust from lox- and lh2- fueled engines like the ssme is almost entirely water vapor{156] nasa addressed environmental concerns with its canceled constellation program in accordance with the national environmental policy act in 2011{157] in contrast ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion{158]{159]on may 8 2003 environmental protection agency
