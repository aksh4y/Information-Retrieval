b'beta plane - wikipedia beta planefrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchin geophysical fluid dynamics an approximation whereby the coriolis parameter f is set to vary linearly in space is called a beta plane approximation on a rotating sphere such as the earth f varies with the sine of latitude; in the so-called f-plane approximation this variation is ignored and a value of f appropriate for a particular latitude is used throughout the domain this approximation can be visualized as a tangent plane touching the surface of the sphere at this latitude a more accurate model is a linear approximation to this variability about a given latitude (in the sense of a taylor series expansion) in analogy with the f-plane this approximation is termed the beta plane even though it no longer describes dynamics on a hypothetical tangent plane the advantage of the beta plane approximation over more accurate formulations is that it does not contribute nonlinear terms to the dynamical equations; such terms make the equations harder to solve the name 'beta plane' derives from the convention to denote the linear coefficient of variation with the greek letter xcexb2the beta plane approximation is useful for the theoretical analysis of many phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics since it makes the equations much more tractable yet retains the important information that the coriolis parameter varies in space in particular rossby waves the most important type of waves if one considers large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics depend on the variation of f as a restoring force; they do not occur if the coriolis parameter is approximated only as a constantsee also{edit]rossby parametercoriolis effectcoriolis frequencybaroclinic instabilityreferences{edit]holton j r an introduction to dynamical meteorology academic press 2004 isbnxc2xa0978-0-12-354015-7pedlosky j geophysical fluid dynamics springer-verlag 1992 isbnxc2xa0978-0-387-96387-7 retrieved from ""categories: fluid dynamicsatmospheric dynamicsoceanography navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagesnorsknorsk nynorskpolski edit links  this page was last edited on 4 july 2017 at 15:08text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
