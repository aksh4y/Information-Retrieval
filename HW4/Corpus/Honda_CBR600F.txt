development of the new bike known internally as mv9 but also called the f2 an alphanumeric that led to its official name: cbr600f2the f2's development began with meetings to discuss concepts and sketches for the new bike a few months later an f2 prototype was produced painted black the bike looked faster and sleeker than the more blocky first generation bike and test results were superior: few motorcycles in the 1990s had the performance ability of the f2{3]cbr600f3{edit]honda cbr600f3production1995xe2x80x931998predecessorcbr600f2successorcbr600f4classsport bikethe cbr600f3 is the third

pan sleeker tail fairings seat and tail light and a revised engine head netting about a 5xc2xa0hp gain over 9596 models the cdi and ram-air system were also revised to allowed for smoother throttle

honda cbr600f4 was produced between 1999 and 2000 it is the last of the cbr600 series of honda sportbikes to be carbureted an aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot through a reduction of internal friction and weight combined with larger valves shorter stroke and a bigger bore higher revs were enabled the spark plug caps had ignition coils built into them slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter a new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used fireblade

bike{7]relatedhonda cbr600rrthe honda cbr600f4i is a sport bike{7] that was produced by honda from 2001 to 2006 two uk versions of the f4i were released in 2001 the cbr600f f1 and onwards had the banana style seat found on pre pgm fi bikes whilst the cbr600f fs1fs2 (the f sport) were sold with the two tier seat units black frames and various other performance upgrades as found in the us model cbr600f4i the f sport was discontinued upon the arrival of the cbr600rr in 2003 in 2003 honda introduced the cbr600rr as a higher-performance race-ready race replica alternative to honda's more street oriented 600-class sport bike the cbr600f4i{8] in 2004 the one-piece "banana" seat model replaced the split seat model this bike sacrificed a little performance but gained a more comfortable riding position with the one piece seat in addition to the clip-ons mounted above the top fork clamp already and also replacing the black frame with one in silver{9]{10] as well as an engine configuration better suited to everyday riding this model is the same as the cbr600f1 and onwards that was sold in the uk from 2001the f4i remained available for three more years before being discontinued with the 2006 model being the final one to be released no major updates were made in these final years except for color scheme changeshistory{edit]for the 2001 model year honda released an upgraded version of the popular cbr600f4 with intentions of becoming more competitive in the middleweight sport bike class the 370xc2xa0lb (170xc2xa0kg) (dry) f4i is a modified f4 with numerous engine chassis and bodywork changesthe 2001 us f4i had a new subframe which raises the seat by five millimeters allows for more storage room and improved two-tier seat{11] the new tail unit has less padding and a higher perch for the passenger the f4i's tail-light is smaller with a new dual-bulb configuration the f4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer the new lcd digital display had a speedometer odometer clock engine temperature read-out amber shift light and trip metersthe single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure (50xc2xa0psi){12] programmed fuel injection xe2x80x94 thus the model designation "f4i" in a number of countries the bike was sold in both the "normal" and "sport" variants the sport having a two-part seat no grab rail and no main stand (though the main stand mounting holes remained) fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions the injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38xc2xa0mm throttle bodies each injector has four nozzles and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the f4weight was also reduced the rear wheel was made lighter and the front wheel{9] the rotor carriers moved out closer to the brake calipers to reduce weight and to improve rigidity but stopping power still was not on par with other bikes in the class there is additional bracing on the steering head for more response better feedback and feel from the front end the suspension has also been tweaked with less high-speed damping and a little more low-speed damping with the shock and fork being more street-bias{13]honda cbr600fmanufacturerhondaproduction2011-2013predecessorhonda cbr600f4isuccessorhonda cbr650fclasssport bikerelatedhonda cb600fadditional engine changes include a lighter camshaft sprocket and increased valve spring pressure (two springs per intake valve) which allow for higher revving there are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow redline is now 14200xc2xa0rpm{9] 700xc2xa0rpm higher than the previous year's f4{14] to increase the bike's pulling capabilities at high speeds 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8{14] the oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 05xc2xa0mm (to 25xc2xa0mm) and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling{14] spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float also there are now two valve springs (inner and outer) on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side{15]the f4i's new bodywork carries a more racy look and provides a 3 reduction in drag it also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40 brighter h7 bulbs compared to the old h4 bulbs{14] the headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens the turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher and closer to the rider the elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger air box and a larger 48xc2xa0usxc2xa0gal (18xc2xa0l; 40xc2xa0impxc2xa0gal) fuel tank and a fuel consumption of 367xc2xa0mpgxe2x80x91us

touringrelatedhonda cb650f2011 cbr600f{edit]in 2011 honda released a new honda cbr600f model built in italy for the european markets that was not released in america it continues the legacy of the cbr model f line{17] to honor the german rider stefan bradl honda germany launched a special edition of the cbr600f the cbr600f lcr it featured an arrow titanium exhaust progrip handlebar grips a rear hugger and single seat cover and an lcr sticker kit as well as combined braking and abs{18] the cbr600f shares most of the components of the naked cb600f 'hornet' such as inverted fork though longer by 50mm and aluminium mono-backbone frame{19]{20] but wraps it in a multi-layered full fairing that lowers drag and protects the rider from windblast as well as new instruments bars and tank it also retains a similar relaxed seating position to minimise rider fatigue{21] the 2011 cbr600f also shares the engine of the highly revised cb600f model that came out in april 2007 this engine is a detuned version of that which is available in the 2007 cbr600rr giving a maximum output power of approximately 102xc2xa0bhp (76xc2xa0kw) at 12000xc2xa0rpm and 4794xc2xa0lbxc2xb7ft (6500xc2xa0nxc2xb7m) of

engine{24] though bike is new from the ground up it has 19 years of development{22] the motor which looks a lot like an early model cbr600rr is aimed at more mid range and low end than the typical 600xc2xa0cc supersport bikes{3] it has about the same specs as a f2 and like the f2 it has a steel twin spar frame{25] with a wet weight much like the f2 as well at 460xc2xa0lb
