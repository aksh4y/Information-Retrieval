lit "free associated state of puerto rico"){b] and briefly called porto rico{c]{16]{17]{18] is an unincorporated territory of the united states located in the northeast caribbean seaan archipelago among the greater antilles puerto rico includes the main island of puerto rico and a number of smaller ones such as mona culebra and vieques the capital and most populous city is san juan its official languages are spanish and english though spanish predominates{19] the island's population is approximately 34 million puerto rico's history tropical climate natural scenery traditional cuisine and tax incentives make it a destination for travelers from around the worldoriginally populated by the indigenous taxc3xadno people the island was claimed in 1493 by christopher columbus for spain during his second voyage later it endured invasion attempts from the french dutch and british four centuries of spanish colonial government influenced the island's cultural landscapes with waves of african slaves canarian and andalusian settlers in the spanish empire puerto rico played a secondary but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like peru and the mainland parts of new spain{20]{21] spain's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century helping to produce a distinctive creole hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the native americans africans and iberians{22] in 1898 following the spanishxe2x80x93american war the united states acquired puerto rico under the terms of the treaty of parispuerto ricans are by law natural-born citizens of the united states and may move freely between the island and the mainland{23] as it is not a state puerto rico does not have a vote in the united states congress which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the puerto rico federal relations act of 1950 as a us territory american citizens residing on the island are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the united states{24] and do not pay federal income tax on puerto rican income congress approved a local constitution allowing us citizens on the territory to elect a governor a 2012 referendum showed a majority (54 of those who voted) disagreed with "the present form of territorial status" a second question asking about a new model had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum{25] another fifth referendum was held on june 11 2017 with "statehood" and "independencefree association" initially as the only available choices at the recommendation of the department of justice an option for the "current territorial status" was added{26] the referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood with 9718 voting for it although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 2299 of the registered voters casting their ballotsin early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government the outstanding bond debt had climbed to 70 billion at a time with 124 unemployment the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession{27] this was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the great depression when the us government in 1935 provided relief efforts through the puerto rico reconstruction administration{28] on may 3 2017 puerto rico's financial oversight board in the us district court for puerto rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under title iii of promesa{29] by early august 2017 the debt was 72 billion with a 45 poverty rate{30]in late september 2017 the category 5 hurricane maria hit puerto rico causing

derivation of borikxc3xa9n its indigenous taxc3xadno name which means "land of the valiant lord"{33]{34]{35] the terms boricua and borincano derive from borikxc3xa9n and borinquen respectively and are commonly used to identify someone of puerto rican heritage the island is also popularly known in spanish as la isla del encanto meaning "the island of enchantment"{36]columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of saint john the baptist while the capital city was named ciudad de puerto rico ("rich port city") eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico while san juan became the name used for the main tradingshipping port and the capital city{d]the island's name was changed to "porto rico" by the united states after the treaty of paris of 1898{38] the anglicized name was used by the us government and private enterprises the name was changed back to puerto rico by a joint resolution in congress introduced by fxc3xa9lix cxc3xb3rdova dxc3xa1vila in 1931{39]the official name of the entity in spanish is estado libre asociado de puerto rico ("free associated state of puerto rico") while its official english name is commonwealth of puerto ricohistorymain article: history of puerto ricopre-columbian eraa reconstructed taxc3xadno village at the tibes ceremonial centerthe ancient history of the archipelago which is now puerto rico is not well known unlike other indigenous cultures in the new world (aztec maya and inca) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto rico's indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray xc3x8dxc3xb1igo abbad y lasierra in 1786 nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the island{40]the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4000 years{41] an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the "puerto ferro man" which was dated to around 2000 bc{42] the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bc{41]the igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and 400xc2xa0ad from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuriesbetween the 7th and 11th centuries the taxc3xadno culture developed on the island by approximately 1000xc2xa0ad it had become dominant at the time of columbus' arrival an estimated 30000 to 60000 taxc3xadno amerindians led by the cacique (chief) agxc3xbceybanxc3xa1 inhabited the island they called it boriken meaning "the great land of the valiant and noble lord"{43] the natives lived in small villages each led by a cacique they subsisted by hunting and fishing done generally by men as well as by the women's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit this lasted until columbus arrived in 1493{44]{45]spanish colony (1493xe2x80x931898)further

puerto rico during his second voyage on november 19 1493 the island was inhabited by the taxc3xadno they called it borikxc3xa9n (borinquen in spanish transliteration) columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of st john the baptist {e] having reported the findings of his first travel columbus brought with him this time a letter from king ferdinand{46] empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de lexc3xb3n a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8 1508 he later served as the first governor of the island{f] eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main tradingshipping portat the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some taxc3xadno indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseases{g]{h]{i]{j]{k]colonization the habsburgsin 1520 king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining taxc3xadno population by that time the taxc3xadno people were few in number{54] enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint-domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave trade{55]from the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro-creole communities meanwhile in the island's interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican jxc3xadbaro culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a "bunker mentality" imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king's silver-laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between cxc3xa1diz and the spanish west indies the colony's seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the "walled city" the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san cristxc3xb3bal designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitorshendricksz 1625 attack on san juan puerto ricoin 1625 in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses' limits like no one else before learning from francis drake's previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the morro's moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost hendricksz's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san cristxc3xb3bal hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the morro's artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish handslate colonial periodhacienda la fortuna a sugar mill complex in puerto rico painted by francisco oller in 1885 (brooklyn museum)during the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations us ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island's natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins' ear the seven years' war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto rico's growing esteem in madrid's eyes on april 17 1797 sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of 6000xe2x80x9313000 men{56] which included german soldiers and royal marines and 60 to 64 ships fierce fighting continued for the next days with spanish troops both sides suffered heavy losses on sunday april 30 the british ceased their attack and began their retreat from san juan by the time independence movements in the larger spanish colonies gained success new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in puerto rico helping to tilt the island's political balance toward the crownthe 16th-century fort castillo san felipe del morro in san juan puerto ricoin 1809 to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the european peninsular war the supreme central junta based in cxc3xa1diz recognized puerto rico as an overseas province of spain this gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened spanish parliament (cxc3xa1diz cortes) with equal representation to mainland iberian mediterranean (balearic islands) and atlantic maritime spanish provinces (canary islands){citation needed]ramxc3xb3n power y giralt the first spanish parliamentary representative from the island of puerto rico died after serving a three-year term in the cortes these parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 and again from 1820 to 1823 they were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by ferdinand vii immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the island's ethnic european population and economy and expanded the spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island{citation needed]minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years with the revolt planned and organized by marcos xiorro in 1821 being the most important even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of puerto rico's folklore{57]politics of liberalismthe flag flown by fidel vxc3xa9lez and his men during the "intentona de yauco" revoltin the early 19th century puerto rico spawned an independence movement that due to harsh persecution by the spanish authorities convened in the island of st thomas the movement was largely inspired by the ideals of simxc3xb3n bolxc3xadvar in establishing a united provinces of new granada and venezuela that included puerto rico and cuba among the influential members of this movement were brigadier general antonio valero de bernabxc3xa9 and marxc3xada de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiled{58]with the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three languagesxe2x80x94spanish english and frenchxe2x80x94it was intended to also attract non-spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the island{59]free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic church{59] the offer was very successful and european immigration continued even after 1898 puerto rico still receives spanish and european immigrationthe lares revolutionary flagpoverty and political estrangement with spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as grito de lares it began in the rural town of lares but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of san sebastixc3xa1nleaders of this independence movement included ramxc3xb3n emeterio betances considered the "father" of the puerto rican independence movement and other political figures such as segundo ruiz belvis slavery was abolished in puerto rico in 1873 "with provisions for periods of apprenticeship"{60]abolition park in ponce puerto ricoleaders of "el grito de lares" went into exile in new york city many joined the puerto rican revolutionary committee founded on december 8 1895 and continued their quest for puerto rican independence in 1897 antonio mattei lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in yauco organized another uprising which became known as the intentona de yauco they raised what they called the puerto rican flag which was adopted as the national flag the local conservative political factions opposed independence rumors of the planned event spread to the local spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to spanish colonial rule{61]in 1897 luis muxc3xb1oz rivera and others persuaded the liberal spanish government to agree to grant limited self-government to the island by royal decree in the autonomic charter including a bicameral legislature{62] in 1898 puerto rico's first but short-lived quasi-autonomous government was organized as an "overseas province" of spain this bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the king of spain xe2x80x93 who held the power to annul any legislative decision xe2x80x93 and a partially elected parliamentary structure in february governor-general manuel macxc3xadas inaugurated the new government under the autonomic charter general elections were held in march and the new government began to function on july 17 1898{63]{64]{65]american era (1898xe2x80x93present)main article: puerto rican campaignin 1890 captain alfred thayer mahan a member of the navy war board and leading us strategic thinker published a book titled the influence of sea power upon history in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the british royal navy part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the caribbean which would serve as coaling and naval stations they would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the isthmus of panama to allow easier passage of ships between the atlantic and pacific oceans{66]the first company of puerto ricans enlisted in the us army 1899william h seward the former secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson had also stressed the importance of building a canal in honduras nicaragua or panama he suggested that the united states annex the dominican republic and purchase puerto rico and cuba the us senate did not approve his annexation proposal and spain rejected the us offer of 160 million dollars for puerto rico and cuba{66]since 1894 the united states naval war college had been developing contingency plans for a war with spain by 1896 the us office of naval intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in puerto rican waters except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named isle of pines (later renamed as isla de la juventud) a recommendation dropped in later planning plans developed for attacks on spanish territories were intended as support operations against spain's forces in and around cuba{67] recent research suggests that the us did consider puerto rico valuable as a naval station and recognized that it and cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar xe2x80x93 a valuable commercial commodity which the united states lacked{68] before the

relationship{70] in the early 20th century puerto rico was ruled by the military with officials including the governor appointed by the president of the united states the foraker act of 1900 gave puerto rico a certain amount of civilian popular government including a popularly elected house of representatives the upper house and governor were appointed by the united statesthe first supreme court of puerto rico appointed pursuant to the foraker actits judicial system was constructed to follow the american legal system; a puerto rico supreme court and a united state district court for the territory were established it was authorized a non-voting member of congress by the title of "resident commissioner" who was appointed in addition this act extended all us laws "not locally inapplicable" to puerto rico specifying in particular exemption from us internal revenue laws{71]the act empowered the civil government to legislate on "all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable" including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in puerto rico though the us congress retained the power to annul acts of the puerto rico legislature{71]{72] during an address to the puerto rican legislature in 1906 president theodore roosevelt recommended that puerto ricans become us citizens{71]{73]in 1914 the puerto rican house of delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the united states but this was rejected by the us congress as "unconstitutional" and in violation of the 1900 foraker act{74]us citizenship and puerto rican citizenshipin 1917 the us congress passed the jonesxe2x80x93shafroth act popularly called the jones act which granted puerto ricans born on or after april 25 1898 us citizenship{75] opponents which included all of the puerto rican house of delegates who voted unanimously against it said that the us imposed citizenship in order to draft puerto rican men into the army as american entry into world

change in relations with the united states he organized a protest at the university of puerto rico in 1935 in which four were killed by policein 1936 us senator millard tydings introduced a bill supporting independence for puerto rico but it was opposed by luis muxc3xb1oz marxc3xadn of the liberal party of puerto rico{77] (tydings had co-sponsored the tydingsxe2x80x93mcduffie act which provided independence to the philippines after a 10-year transition under a limited autonomy) all the puerto rican parties supported the bill but muxc3xb1oz marxc3xadn opposed it tydings did not gain passage of the bill{77]in 1937 albizu campos' party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in ponce the insular police resembling the national guard opened fire upon unarmed{78] cadets and bystanders alike{78] the attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the us congressman vito marcantonio and confirmed by the report of the hays commission which investigated the events the commission was led by arthur garfield hays counsel to the american civil liberties union{78]nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded many in their backs while running away{79]{80] the hays commission declared it a massacre and police mob action{79] and it has since been known as the ponce massacre in the aftermath on april 2 1943 tydings introduced a bill in

expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution the constitution of puerto rico was formally adopted on july 3 1952 the constitutional convention

constitution as a translation into english of the term to "estado libre asociado" (ela)in 1967 puerto rico's legislative assembly polled the political preferences of the puerto rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of puerto rico this constituted the first plebiscite by the legislature for a choice among three status options (commonwealth statehood and independence) in subsequent plebiscites organized by puerto rico held in 1993 and 1998 (without any formal commitment on the part of the us government to honor the results) the current political status failed to receive majority support in 1993 commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes (486 versus 463 for statehood) while the "none of the above" option which was the popular democratic party-sponsored choice won in 1998 with 503 of the votes (versus 465 for statehood) disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives and commonwealth advocates among others reportedly urged a vote for "none of the above"{85]{86]{87]in 1950 the us congress approved public law 600 (pl 81-600) which allowed for a democratic referendum in puerto rico to determine whether puerto ricans desired to draft their own local constitution{88] this act was meant to be adopted in the "nature of a compact" it required congressional approval of the puerto rico constitution before

change because there were almost 500000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum creating confusion as to the voters' true desire congress decided to ignore the vote{99]{100]the first three plebiscites provided voters with three options: statehood free association and independence the puerto rican status referendum 2017 in june 2017 was going to offer only two options: statehood and independencefree

the us justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial clause{120] of the us constitution{119]in 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice{121] in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the us house committee on resources stated "puerto rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under resolution 1541" (the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as (1) national independence (2) free association based on separate sovereignty or (3) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality) the report concluded that puerto rico " remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of 'free association' with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice" that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the us congress and that us congress can also withdraw the us citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose{122]{123] the application of

continue as a commonwealth the government of puerto rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified; if puerto ricans voted to have a different political status a second referendum would determine whether puerto rico would become a us state an independent country or a sovereign nation

government submitted a brief as amicus curiae to the us supreme court related to the case commonwealth of puerto rico v sanchez valle the us government official position is that the us constitution does not contemplate "sovereign territories" that the court has consistently recognized that "there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself" and a us territory has "no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because "the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states" congress's plenary authority over

decrease in census history for puerto rico it went from the 3808610 residents registered in the 2000 census to 3725789 in the 2010 census{178]a declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society the us census bureau's estimate for july 1 2016 was 3411307 people down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3725789 people{179]continuous european immigration and high natural increase helped the population of puerto rico grow from 155426 in 1800 to almost a million by the close of the 19th centurya census conducted by royal decree on september 30 1858 gave the following totals of the puerto rican population at that time: 341015 were free colored; 300430 identified as whites; and 41736 were slaves{180]during the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in puerto rico primarily from the canary islands and andalusia but also from other parts of spain such as catalonia asturias galicia and the balearic islands and numerous spanish loyalists from spain's former colonies in south america settlers from outside spain also arrived in the islands including from corsica france lebanon china portugal ireland scotland germany and italy this immigration from non-hispanic countries was the result of the real cedula de gracias de 1815 ("royal decree of graces of 1815") which allowed european catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island provided they paid taxes and continued to support the catholic churchracial and ethnic composition in puerto rico (2015 census

recent immigrants settle in and around san juanemigration is a major part of contemporary puerto rican history starting soon after world warxc2xa0ii poverty cheap airfares and promotion by the island government caused waves of puerto ricans to move to the united states particularly to the northeastern states and florida{199] this trend continued even as puerto rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined puerto ricans continue to follow a pattern of "circular migration" with some migrants returning to the island in recent years the population has declined markedly falling nearly 1 in 2012 and an additional 1 (36000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration{200]according to the 2010 census the number of puerto ricans living in the united states outside of puerto

entirely in spanish there have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in english only objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in english{208] english is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school the languages of the deaf community are american sign language and its local variant puerto rican sign languagethe spanish of puerto rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the spanish spoken elsewhere as a product of puerto rican history the island possesses a unique spanish dialect puerto rican spanish utilizes many taxc3xadno words as well as english words the largest influence on the spanish spoken in puerto rico is that of the canary islands the spanish of puerto rico also includes taxc3xadno words typically in the context of vegetation natural phenomena or

protestants:puerto rico by virtue of its long political association with the united states is the most protestant of latin american countries with a protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent the majority of whom are pentecostal david stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960xe2x80x931985 for another twenty-five years puerto rico

years the pnp on the other hand has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years the other 12 years experienced a divided governmentsince 1952 puerto rico has had three main political parties: the popular democratic party (ppd in spanish) the new progressive party (pnp in spanish) and the puerto rican independence party (pip) the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the island's status with the us as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47 of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5after 2007 other parties emerged on the island the first the puerto ricans for puerto rico party (ppr in spanish) was registered that same year the party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform but it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election four years later the 2012 election saw the emergence of the movimiento unixc3xb3n soberanista (mus; english: sovereign union movement) and the partido del pueblo trabajador (ppt; english: working people's party) but none obtained more than 1 of the voteother non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movementlawmain articles: constitution of puerto rico and law of puerto ricothe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systemspuerto rico is the only current us possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english: namely spanish because the us federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in us federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courtstitle 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the us government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901 it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal codethe judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does{243] such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardypolitical statusmain articles: political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto ricothe nature of puerto rico's political relationship with the us is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations{244] specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a us territory become a us state or become an independent country{245]within the united statesthe capitol of puerto rico home of the legislative assembly in puerto ricoconstitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the us constitution{246] laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the us congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks "the full sovereignty of an independent nation" for example the power to manage its "external relations with other nations" which is held by the us federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the us constitution has been extended to an area (by congress or the courts) its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say "what the law is"{247]puerto ricans "were collectively made us citizens" in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act{248] us citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the us president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory (see above) and not a us state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise us citizens residing in puerto rico{236]{249]only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other us supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the us armed forces and since 1917 they have been included in the us compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effectthough the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of us federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances{250]{251]{252]{253]{254]{255]{256]{257] in 2009 puerto rico paid 3742 billion into the

the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a us state{259] also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system{260]while a state may try an individual for the same crime heshe was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a us territory puerto rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible{243]in 1992 president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operationsmany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a us state there is also a us federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the us mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new yorker of puerto rican descent serves as an associate justice of the supreme court

established several trade agreements with other nations particularly with hispanic american countries such as colombia and panamxc3xa1{261]{262]it has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington dc new york city and florida and has included in

territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as the territory's lieutenant governor it is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in puerto rico the puerto rico federal affairs administration along with the office of the resident commissioner manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the united states (including the federal government of the united states local and state governments of the united states

four-year termsa map of puerto rico showing its municipalitieseconomymain articles: economy of puerto rico and puerto rico government-debt crisispuerto rico's gross domestic product (gdp) by economic sectorthe economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of 72204 billion (equivalent to 103 of gnp) and a government deficit of 25 billion{270]{271] according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is 23830 (ppp international dollars) ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world{272] its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics) followed by the service industry (primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism){n]{o] in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice (meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions) with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juan{274]the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island; its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials{citation needed] and consequently its dependence on imports; as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industrypuerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013 following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the us internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for us corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 of the rest of the world{275]academically most of puerto rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;{p] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;{q] as well as its highly inefficient local government{r]{s] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 of its gross domestic product throughout time{t]{u]in comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi (the poorest state of the us) with 41 of its population below the poverty line{v] when compared to latin america puerto rico has the highest gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto rico's agricultural sector represents less than 1 of gnp{282]heavy debt loadin early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to 70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 124 unemployment that is more than twice the mainland us average{283] the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession{27]the commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015 with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system{284]{285] "without action before april puerto ricoxe2x80x99s ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1 2017 the health care of up to 900000 poor us citizens living in puerto rico" according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that "congress must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto ricoxe2x80x99s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth"{285]initially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto rico's governor ricardo rossellxc3xb3 to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28 just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31{27] it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under promesa{286] an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the rossellxc3xb3 government with more than 80 of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt{287]in early august 2017 the island's financial oversight board (created by promesa) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve 218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 reduction in benefits to begin addressing the 50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities{30]{288]public financesmain articles: puerto rico government-debt crisis budget of the government of puerto rico and public debt of puerto ricopuerto rico has an operating budget of about us98 billion with expenses at about 104 billion; creating a structural deficit of 775 million (about 79 of the budget){289] the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto rico's treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973{w]{291]the 2012 budget of the government of puerto ricoprojected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71b or about 70 of puerto rico's gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after puerto rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade ("junk status") by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 96xe2x80x94or about 15 billionxe2x80x94of puerto rico's central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service{x] harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years{needs update]for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a "general budget" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the "consolidated budget" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto rico's government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other fundsboth budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently 29b and 90b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from us federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budgetthe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget; a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than 13b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority (prhta) reporting losses of 409m the puerto rico electric power authority (prepa; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of 272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority (prasa; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of 112m{293]losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 of puerto rico's entire public debt today{294] holistically from fy2000xe2x80x93fy2010 puerto rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 9 while gdp remained stagnant{295] this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure 9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek court protection{296]in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget (ogp in spanish) formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto rico's fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted "at the beginning of each regular session" the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor's approval or approve it without the governor's consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber{297]once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank (the government's intergovernmental bank) manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporationscost of livinga map of jones act carrier routes for puerto ricothe cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past

value sits at 119600{aa]one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920 also known as the jones act which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage{309] because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico-bound goods load mainland-bound puerto rico-manufactured goods and continue to us ports instead they must proceed directly to us ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico-bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by us-flagged ships{309]the local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the us congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success{ab] the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21{311]{312] these measures have always received support from all the major local political partiesin 2013 the government accountability office published a report which concluded that "repealing or amending the jones act cabotage law might cut puerto rico shipping costs" and that "shippers believed that opening the trade to non-us-flag competition could lower costs"{ac]{ad] however the same gao report also found that "{shippers] doing business in puerto rico that gao contacted reported that the freight rates are oftenxe2x80x94although not alwaysxe2x80x94lower for foreign carriers going to and from puerto rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the united states despite longer distances data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred"{314] ultimately the report concluded that "{the] effects of modifying the application of the jones act for puerto rico are highly uncertain" for both puerto rico and the united states particularly for the us shipping industry and the military preparedness of the united states{313]{314]educationmain article: education in puerto ricothe first

inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall traditionally santos were seen as messengers between the earth and heaven as such they occupied a special place on household altars where people prayed to them asked for help or tried to summon their protectionalso popular caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both spain and africa though for different purposes the spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed christians into returning to the church while tribal africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they

united states and puerto rico as sovereign nations such agreement would provide the scope of the jurisdictional powers that the people of puerto rico agree to confer to the united states and retain all other jurisdictional powers and authorities under this option the american citizenship would be subject to negotiation with the united states government; (2) proclamation of independence i demand
