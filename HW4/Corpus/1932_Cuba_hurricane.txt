also as the hurricane of santa cruz del sur{1] or the 1932 camagxc3xbcey hurricane{2] was the deadliest and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in cuban history the only category 5 atlantic hurricane ever recorded in november the cyclone had a path through the caribbean sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the atlantic hurricane season the storm's strong winds storm surge and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern cuba where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on cuba significant effects were also felt in the cayman islands and the bahamas with lesser effects felt elsewherethe tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the lesser antilles on octoberxc2xa030 and tracked westward into the caribbean sea reaching tropical storm strength the next day moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the caribbean the storm reached hurricane strength on novemberxc2xa02 before a period of rapid intensification ensued on novemberxc2xa06 the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) the storm weakened to categoryxc2xa04 intensity while recurving northeast moving ashore cuba's camagxc3xbcey province on novemberxc2xa09 with winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) after traversing the island the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central bahamas islands and near bermuda on novemberxc2xa013 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next dayas an intensifying hurricane in the southern caribbean sea the storm moved near the netherlands antilles and colombia causing widespread effects a prolonged passage of curacao resulted in the damaging of the harbor fortification the storm lashed the coast of colombia with strong winds and torrential rainfall severely hampering the banana crop in the region and disrupting telecommunications several towns particularly those near the coast sustained significant infrastructural damage marked albeit localized damage to banana crops was also reported in jamaica where strong winds toppled numerous trees in open waters the storm's track brought it across numerous shipping lanes largely disrupting shipping primarily in the central caribbean and damaging several shipscontents1 meteorological history2 preparations and impact21 caribbean sea jamaica and northern south america22 cayman islands23 cuba3 see also4 references5 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe 1932xc2xa0cuba hurricane can be traced back to a tropical depression first identified at 06:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa030 by ship observations roughly 200xc2xa0mi (320xc2xa0km) east of guadeloupe{3]{4] tracking generally westward the depression crossed the lesser antilles the next day between dominica and martinique{3] barometric pressures decrease to as much as 1008xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2977xc2xa0inhg) in st lucia confirmed the presence of a developing tropical cyclone{1] shortly after traversing the islands the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm intensity at 18:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa031{3] concurrently as the storm was gradually intensifying the tropical cyclone began to take an unusual course towards the southwest{4] on novemberxc2xa02 the storm intensified to hurricane status while north of the netherlands antilles{3]steadily strengthening the hurricane reached categoryxc2xa02 status on novemberxc2xa03{3] during the day the storm passed approximately 50xc2xa0mi (80xc2xa0km) north of punta gallinas in colombia the northernmost extent of south america{4] however at the same time the hurricane curved towards the west causing the storm to move away from colombia and venezuela{3] during the next few days the hurricane rapidly intensified reaching major hurricane status late on novemberxc2xa04 the next day the hurricane's intensity was analyzed to have been the equivalent of a modern-day categoryxc2xa05 hurricane while curving northward{3] although the storm was analyzed operationally to have maximized as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane reanalysis of the hurricane indicated that the tropical cyclone was much more intense than suggested initially based on observations by the ss phemius the crew of which visually estimated winds of around 200xc2xa0mph (320xc2xa0kmh) at the maximum of the storm and measured unusually low pressures{1] early on novemberxc2xa06 the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh){3] during that time the ss phemius recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 915xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2702xc2xa0inhg); this measurement was the lowest documented throughout the storm's existence as this report did not occur within the hurricane's eye the storm's true minimum pressure may have been much less{1]pacing northward the hurricane gradually weakened after maximum intensity on novemberxc2xa06 but held its categoryxc2xa05 strength for 72xc2xa0consecutive hours before finally dropping to categoryxc2xa04 status{3] due to a gradual curve towards the northeast the hurricane tracked near cayman brac on novemberxc2xa09;{1] a minimum barometric pressure of 939xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2773xc2xa0inhg) was documented on the island only slight weakening occurred before the hurricane made landfall on the caribbean coast of cuba's camagxc3xbcey province at 14:00xc2xa0utc that day at the time of landfall the tropical cyclone was estimated to have had a minimum pressure of 918xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2711xc2xa0inhg) and maximum sustained winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) with these winds extending as far as 40xc2xa0mi (65xc2xa0km) from the center of the hurricane the storm traversed cuba in six hours before emerging into the atlantic ocean late on novemberxc2xa09 after which it began to cross the central bahamian archipelago at 07:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa010 the hurricane made a second landfall on long island bahamas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day categoryxc2xa03 continuing to track northeast the storm moved east of bermuda two days later{1] on novemberxc2xa013 the hurricane began to interact with an extratropical cyclone centered over the canadian maritimes{1]{4] and later weakened to tropical storm strength{3] the tropical cyclone later became extratropical itself before it was last noted at 18:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa014{3]preparations and impact{edit]caribbean sea jamaica and northern south america{edit]the british vessel ss phemius which followed the progress of the hurricane from novemberxc2xa05-7 and documented the storm's lowest measured pressureas the hurricane moved slowly through the eastern and southern caribbean the rough seas and strong winds disrupted shipping routes on novemberxc2xa06 the american schooner abundance encountered the storm east of jamaica resulting in a destroyed rudder and a beaching on jamaica's morant point{5]{6] however the ship's six crew were extracted from the disabled vessel and were transported to the united states{5] although the ss phemius would later return safely to port in cuba{1] reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an sos message prompted the united fruit company liner tela to search for the initially missing ship which failed due to poor visibility conditions{5]{7] this was followed by a search operation undertaken by the uss overton (dd-239) and uss swan (am-34){8] on novemberxc2xa08 the ss phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug however during the same period of time both the steamer tacira and the freighter san simeon were disabled after encountering the storm requiring towing to safety{9] several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the storm{10]some damage was reported in northern south america as the hurricane swept near the coast in colombia rail telecommunications were interrupted near santa marta and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the storm's winds and rain{5] in santa marta itself several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the storm's effects docks on santa marta's port were also damaged{11] heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments{12]{13] elsewhere along the coast many of colombia's seaports were damaged by the storm's effects while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage{14] due to sparse reports from the remainder of colombia{15] the extent of damage in barranquilla remains unspecified{5] with other nearby towns reporting "heavy" damage{15] the village of sevilla valle del cauca was almost entirely destroyed{16] providencia island just off of colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 36xc2xa0homes{4] to the northeast in curacao the passing hurricane destroyed the island harbor's fortifications{14] a seawall near the entrance to sint anna harbor suffered partial collapse while a pontoon bridge linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed in nearby bonaire a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seas{17]with the hurricane threatening jamaica pan american world airways cancelled its flights servicing kingston jamaica{18] in jamaica the storm's passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as 71xc2xa0mph (114xc2xa0kmh) to sweep across the island{19] destroying over 2xc2xa0million trees{20] although effects overall were generally minimal some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a 50xc2xa0loss of banana trees due to the storm{4] the cost of damage on jamaica was us4xc2xa0million{21]cayman islands{edit]the storm devastated the cayman islands especially cayman brac which was inundated by the storm surge which was reported to be as high as 10xc2xa0m (33xc2xa0ft) many homes and buildings were washed out to sea as a result of the storm and many people had to climb trees to escape the floodwaters 110xc2xa0people died on the islands; one of them was on grand cayman and the rest were on cayman brac{22] the ship balboa also sank as a result of the storm{23]cuba{edit]santa cruz del sur camagxc3xbcey province cuba after the hurricanealthough no warnings were issued initially the national observatory of cuba voiced concerns that the intense tropical cyclone presented a danger to cuba particularly camagxc3xbcey province as early as novemberxc2xa05 however the observatory indicated that forecasting the future motion of the hurricane was difficult as the storm's intensity and previous motion was not consistent with climatology{24] on novemberxc2xa08 a hurricane warning was issued for the southeastern extent of cuba{25] as a precautionary measure shipping routes servicing ports in eastern cuba were suspended{26]the town of santa cruz del sur in camagxc3xbcey province was virtually obliterated by a massive storm surge which measured 65xc2xa0m (213xc2xa0ft) in height{27] few buildings remained standing in the area in that coastal town alone a total of 2870xc2xa0people lost their lives in total 3033xc2xa0people died in cuba and damage there was estimated at 40xc2xa0million (1932 usd; 7021 million today){27]see also{edit]tropical cyclones
