as a result small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patternsstudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on earth a famous landmark in the solar system jupiter's great red spot is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years however weather is not limited to planetary bodies a star's corona is constantly being lost to space creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system the movement of mass ejected from the sun is known as the solar windcontents1 causes2 shaping the planet earth3 major wind and pressure systems and related weather4 effect on humans41 effects on populations5 forecasting6 modification7 microscale meteorology8 extremes on earth9 extraterrestrial within the solar system10 space weather11 see also12 references13 external linkscausescumulus mediocris cloud surrounded by stratocumuluson earth the common weather phenomena include wind cloud rain snow fog and dust storms less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes typhoons and ice storms almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere){3] weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood{5]weather occurs primarily due to air pressure temperature and moisture differences between one place to another these differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot which varies by latitude from the tropics in other words the farther from the tropics one lies the lower the sun angle is which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface{6] the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream{7] weather systems in the mid-latitudes such as extratropical cyclones are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity){8] weather systems in the tropics such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems are caused by different processes2015 xe2x80x93 warmest global year on record (since 1880) xe2x80x93 colors indicate temperature anomalies (nasanoaa; 20 january 2016){9]because the earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year in june the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun so at any given northern hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in december (see effect of sun angle on climate){10] this effect causes seasons over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years changes in earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the earth and influence long-term climate (see milankovitch cycles){11]the uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation{12] higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating which produces the adiabatic lapse rate{13]{14] in some situations the temperature actually increases with height this phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development on local scales temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans forests ice sheets or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity roughness or moisture contentsurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences a hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure{15] the resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions creating a wind and the earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the coriolis effect{16] the simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena large scale examples include the hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezesthe atmosphere is a chaotic system as a result small changes to one part of the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole{17] this atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses{18] although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction however it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill{19]shaping the planet earthmain article: weatheringweather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the earth the process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances{20] during rains precipitation the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air this causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic which aids the erosive properties of water the released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain) and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seasoceans the sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils in this way weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface{21]major wind and pressure systems and related weatherregionnamepressuresurface windsweatherequator (0xc2xb0)doldrums (itcz) (equatorial low)lowlight variable windscloudiness abundant precipitation in all seasons;

they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and techniques to suppress hail{43] a recent example of weather control was china's preparation for the 2008 summer olympic games china shot 1104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 august 2008 guo hu head of the beijing municipal meteorological bureau (bmb) confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in baoding city of hebei province to the southwest and beijing's fangshan district recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters{44]whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:{43]acid rain caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere adversely affects freshwater lakes vegetation and structuresanthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibilityclimate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought extreme temperatures flooding high winds and severe storms{45]heat generated by large metropolitan areas have been shown to minutely affect nearby weather even at distances as far as 1600 kilometres (990xc2xa0mi){46]the effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization including ecosystems natural resources food and fiber production economic development and human health{47]microscale meteorologymicroscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale about 1xc2xa0km or less these two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as "mesoscale and microscale meteorology" (mmm) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map these include small and generally fleeting cloud "puffs" and other small cloud features{48]extremes on earthearly morning sunshine over bratislava slovakia february 2008the same area just three hours later after light snowfallmain articles: extremes on earth and list of weather recordson earth temperatures usually range xc2xb140xc2xa0xc2xb0c (100xc2xa0xc2xb0f to xe2x88x9240xc2xa0xc2xb0f) annually the range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range the coldest air temperature ever recorded on earth is xe2x88x92892xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x921286xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at vostok station antarctica on 21 july 1983 the hottest air temperature ever recorded was 577xc2xa0xc2xb0c (1359xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at 'aziziya libya on 13 september 1922{49] but that reading is queried the highest recorded average annual temperature was 344xc2xa0xc2xb0c (939xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at dallol ethiopia{50] the coldest recorded average annual temperature was xe2x88x92551xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x92672xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at vostok station antarctica{51]the coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at eureka nunavut in canada where the annual average temperature is xe2x88x92197xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x9235xc2xa0xc2xb0f){52]extraterrestrial within the solar systemjupiter's great red spot in february 1979 photographed by the unmanned voyager 1 nasa space probestudying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on earth{53] weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on earth but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition the cassinixe2x80x93huygens mission to titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds{54] earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones three in each hemisphere{55] in contrast jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones{56] titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude{57] and venus has a single jet near the equator{58]one of the most famous landmarks in the solar system jupiter's great red spot is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years{59] on other gas giants the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600xc2xa0metres per second (about 2100xc2xa0kmh or 1300xc2xa0mph) have been measured on the planet neptune{60] this has created a puzzle for planetary scientists the weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by neptune is only about xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x84900 of that received by earth yet the intensity of weather phenomena on neptune is far greater than on earth{61] the strongest planetary winds discovered so far are on the extrasolar planet hd 189733 b which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9600 kilometres per hour (6000xc2xa0mph){62]space weatheraurora borealismain article: space weatherweather is not limited to planetary bodies like all stars the sun's corona is constantly being lost to space creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system the movement of mass ejected from the sun is known as the solar wind inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star such as coronal mass ejections form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the solar system as saturn{63] the activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces the interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae{64] and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals{65]see alsoweather stationoutline of meteorologyreferences^ merriam-webster dictionary weather retrieved on 27 june 2008^ glossary of meteorology hydrosphere retrieved on 27 june 2008^ a b glossary of meteorology troposphere retrieved on 27 june 2008^ "climate" glossary of meteorology american meteorological society retrieved 14 may 2008xc2xa0^ o'carroll cynthia m (18 october 2001) "weather forecasters may look sky-high for answers" goddard space flight center (nasa) archived from the original on 12 july 2009xc2xa0^ nasa world book at nasa: weather archived copy at webcite (10 march 2013) retrieved on 27 june 2008^ john p stimac air pressure and wind retrieved on 8 may 2008^ carlyle h wash stacey h heikkinen chi-sann liou and wendell a nuss a rapid cyclogenesis event during gale iop 9 retrieved on 28 june 2008^ brown dwayne;
