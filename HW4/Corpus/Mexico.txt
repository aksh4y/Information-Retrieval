codex mendozamxc4x93xihco is the nahuatl term for the heartland of the aztec empire namely{34] the valley of mexico and its people the mexica and surrounding territories this became the future state of mexico as a division of new spain prior to independence (compare latium) it is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the aztec triple alliance as a result or vice versa after new spain won independence from spain representatives decided to name the new country after its capital mexico city this was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient mexica capital of mexico-tenochtitlantraditionally the name tenochtitlan was thought to come from nahuatl tetl {xcbx88tetxc9xac] ("rock") and nxc5x8dchtli {xcbx88noxcbx90txcax83txc9xaci] ("prickly pear") and is often thought to mean "among the prickly pears {growing among] rocks" however one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as "the bancroft dialogues" suggests the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertain{35]the suffix -co is the nahuatl locative making the word a place name beyond that the etymology is uncertain it has been suggested that it is derived from mextli or mxc4x93xihtli a secret name for the god of war and patron of the mexica huitzilopochtli in which case mxc4x93xihco means "place where huitzilopochtli lives"{36] another hypothesis suggests that mxc4x93xihco derives from a portmanteau of the nahuatl words for "moon" (mxc4x93tztli) and navel (xxc4xabctli){37] this meaning ("place at the center of the moon") might refer to tenochtitlan's position in the middle of lake texcoco the system of interconnected lakes of which texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from mxc4x93ctli the goddess of maguey{37]the name of the city-state was transliterated to spanish as mxc3xa9xico with the phonetic value of the letter 'x' in medieval spanish which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative {xcax83] this sound as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative {xcax92] represented by a 'j' evolved into a voiceless velar fricative {x] during the 16th century this led to the use of the variant mxc3xa9jico in many publications in spanish most notably in spain whereas in mexico and most other spanishxe2x80x93speaking countries mxc3xa9xico was the preferred spelling in recent years the real academia espaxc3xb1ola which regulates the spanish language determined that both variants are acceptable in spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is mxc3xa9xico{38] the majority of publications in all spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used{citation needed] in english the 'x' in mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound but the consonant cluster {ks]the official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed the declaration of independence signed on november 6 1813 by the deputies of the congress of anxc3xa1huac called the territory amxc3xa9rica septentrional (northern america) on two occasions (1821xe2x80x931823 and 1863xe2x80x931867) the country was known as imperio mexicano (mexican empire) all three federal constitutions (1824 1857 and 1917 the current constitution) used the name estados unidos mexicanos{39]xe2x80x94or the variant estados-unidos mexicanos{40] all of which have been translated as "united mexican states" the phrase repxc3xbablica mexicana "mexican republic" was used in the 1836 constitutional laws{41]historymain article: history of mexicosee also: history of roman catholicism in mexico

earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10000 years ago{42] mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bce{43]in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area{44] in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed{45]the earliest complex civilization in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bce olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative-era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes{46] the formative-era of mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilizationin the subsequent pre-classical period the maya and zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at calakmul and monte albxc3xa1n respectively during this period the first true mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the epi-olmec and the zapotec cultures the mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the classic maya hieroglyphic script{47]in central mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of teotihuacan which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the maya area as well as north teotihuacan with a population of more than 150000 people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-columbian americas{48] after the collapse of teotihuacxc3xa1n around 600 ce competition ensued between several important political centers in central mexico such as xochicalco and cholula at this time during the epi-classic nahua peoples began moving south into mesoamerica from the north and became

it a way to distinguish present-day mexicans from pre-conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century{49]the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid{50]the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central mexico{51] the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle{52] this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule{53]conquest of the aztec triple alliance

the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later{56] unintentionally introduced by spanish conquerors among whom smallpox was endemic the infectious disease ravaged mesoamerica in the 1520s it killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity{57] other sources however mentioned that the death toll of the aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350000 aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million{58] severely weakened the aztec empire was easily defeated by cortxc3xa9s and his forces on his second return with the help of state of tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300000{59] the native population declined 80xe2x80x9390 by 1600 to 1xe2x80x9325 million any population estimate of pre-columbian mexico is bound to be a guess but 8xe2x80x9312 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nationsmallpox was a devastating disease: it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity{60] the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule{61] many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout mexico{62]the territory became part of the spanish empire under the name of new spain mexico city was systematically rebuilt by cortxc3xa9s following the fall of tenochtitlan in 1521 much of the identity traditions and architecture of mexico developed during the 300-year colonial period{63]viceroyalty of new spain (1521xe2x80x931821)main article: new

mexico city in 1521 was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which mexico was known as nueva espaxc3xb1a (new spain) the kingdom of new spain was created from the remnants of the aztec hegemonic empire subsequent enlargements such as the conquest of the tarascan state resulted in the creation of the viceroyalty of new spain in 1535 the viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern mexico central america as far south as costa rica and the western united states the viceregal capital mexico city also administrated the spanish west indies (the caribbean) the spanish east indies (the philippines) and spanish floridathe indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population the population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases particularly smallpox introduced during the columbian exchange during the three hundred years of the colonial era mexico received between 400000 and 500000 europeans between 200000{64] and 250000 africans{65] and between 40000 and 120000 asians{66] the 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizos{67]colonial law with spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the cabildos) and the spanish crown whereby upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people even those of pure spanish blood (criollos) administration was based on the racial separation of the population among "republics"

government{citation needed]during this period the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in mexico city and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering with limited trade the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs resentment built up from california to texas both the mission

an average of 170 per year up from 116 per year between 2000 and 2005even though mexico is a very ethnically diverse country research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of mexico's government to unify all mexicans under a single ethnic identity (that of the "mestizo") as a result since 1930 the only ethnic classification that has been included in mexican censuses has been that of "indigenous peoples"{237] even then across the years the government has used different criteria to count indigenous peoples with each of them returning considerably different numbers it is not until very recently that the mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the afro-mexican and euro-mexican population that lives in the countryas of 2015{update] the foreign-born population was 1007063{238] the majority of these individuals were born in the united states and mexico is home to the largest number of us citizens

manifestations of early national self-pride wealth and order depicted through clothing mercantile goods and religious symbols challenged preconceived notions of new spain in europe{242]mexico is ethnically diverse; with people of several ethnicities being united under a single national identity{243] the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures primarily european culture and indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje{243]{244] mexican politicians and reformers such as josxc3xa9 vasconcelos (promoter of the cosmic race) and manuel gamio (promoter of indigenismo) were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje{245]the large majority of mexicans have historically been classified as "mestizos" in modern mexican usage the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or not{246] since the term carries a variety of different socio-cultural economic racial and biological meanings it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in mexican society{117]{247] although it's often used in literature about mexican social identities and on intellectual circles in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula the word mestizo has historically had a different meaning being used to refer to the maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos{248] in chiapas the word "ladino" is used instead of mestizo{249] according to encyclopxc3xa6dia britannica racially mestizo mexicans make up 50 to 67 of the country's population{250]the total percentage of mexico's population who is indigenous varies considerably depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses: it is 54 if the hability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous{251] if racial self-identification is used it's 149{252]{253] and if people who considers themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 215{254] nonetheless all the censuses conclude that the majority of mexico's indigenous population is concentrated in the southern and south-eastern mexican states primarily in rural areas some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of "usos y costumbres" which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law according to the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are:{255] yucatxc3xa1n at 59 quintana roo 39 and campeche 27 chiefly maya; oaxaca with 48 of the population the most numerous groups being the mixtec and zapotec peoples; chiapas at 28 the majority being tzeltal and tzotzil maya; hidalgo 24 the majority being otomi; puebla 19 and guerrero 17 mostly nahua peoples and the states of san luis potosxc3xad and veracruz both home to a population that is 15 indigenous mostly from the totonac nahua and teenek (huastec) groups{256] the absolute numbers of the indigenous population growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling{257] all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average in all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations literacy rates are also much lower with 27 of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12 the indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average starting earlier and continuing longer however 55 of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary compared to 20 for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing{256]similarly to mestizo and indigenous peoples estimations for the percentage of european-descended mexicans within the mexican population vary considerably: their numbers range from around 10xe2x80x9320 according to the encyclopxc3xa6dia britannica{250] to as high as 47{258]{259] according to a nationwide survey conducted by mexico's government made with the intent of having a precise outlook of the social and economic inequalities that exist between light skinned european looking mexicans and indigenous or african looking mexicans{260] is the first time the mexican government has conducted an official population study that referenced mexico's white population in nearly a centurywhile during the colonial era most of the european migration into mexico was spanish in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-spanish europeans immigrated to the country according to 20th and 21st century academics large scale intermixing between european immigrants and native indigenous peoples would produce a mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of mexico's population by the time of the mexican revolution{261] however according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of european men married with european women said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as european migrants who arrived to mexico being almost exclusively men{262] nowadays mexicoxe2x80x99s northern and western regions have the highest european populations with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly european ancestry{263]the afro-mexican population (1381853 individuals as of 2015{update]){264] is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized mexico's indigenous and european past; it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo (mixed europeanindigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census 649 (896829) of afro-mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 93 of afro-mexicans speak an indigenous language{265] the states with the highest self-report of afro-mexicans were guerrero (65 of the population) oaxaca (495) and veracruz (328){266] afro-mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the costa chica of oaxaca and costa chica of guerreroduring the early 20th century a substantial number of arabs (mostly christians){267] began arriving from the crumbling ottoman empire the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400000 mexicans have some lebanese ancestry{268] smaller ethnic groups in mexico include south and east asians present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino (regardless of ethnicity) and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves{269] the largest group were filipinos and some 200000 mexicans can trace filipino ancestry{270] modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the chinese were the second largest immigrant group{271]official censusesthe first census in mexico that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census also known as the revillagigedo census it was mexico's (then known as new spain) first national population census most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as prussian geographer alexander von humboldt while every author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country they don't seem to vary much with europeans ranging from 18 to 22 of new spain's population mestizos ranging from 21 to 25 indians ranging from 51 to 61 and africans being between 6000 and 10000 the estimations given for the total population range from 3799561 to 6122354 it is concluded then that across nearly three centuries of colonization the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13xe2x80x9317 per century the authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the spanish colonists or being at war with them{272] anthropologist gonzalo aguirre beltrxc3xa1n goes beyond said numbers and splits the mestizo group into "euromestizos" "indomestizos" and "afromestizos" calculating their numbers on more than one million 700000 and 600000 respectively{273] independent-era mexico eliminated the legal basis of the colonial caste system which led to exclude racial classification in the censuses to comeaccording to mexico's second census ever which considered race made right after the mexican revolution on 1921{274] 59 of mexico's population was mestizo 29 was indigenous and only 9 was european with mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states{274] for a long time this census' results have been taken as fact with extraofficial international publications such as the world factbook and encyclopxc3xa6dia britannica using them as a reference to estimate mexico's racial composition up to this day{275]{250] however in recent time mexican academics have subjected the census' results to scrutiny claiming that such a drastic alteration on demographic trends in regards to the 1793 census is not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent mexico{276] said authors claim that the mexican society went through a "more cultural than biological mestizaje process" sponsored by the state on its efforts to unify the mexican population which resulted on the inflation of the percentage of the mestizo mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in mexico{277]in recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct ethnic surveys and censuses again and has also widen the criteria to classify the ethnicies who were already considered an example being the indigenous mexican classification which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities andor spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 215 of mexico's population (including people who declared to be partially indigenous){254] afro-mexicans are 12 of mexico's population (including people who declared to be partially african){254] and european mexicans amount to 47 of mexico's population (based on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry){258]{259]{260] less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for albeit their numbers do not vary significantly from previous estimations out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic label's fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with "static" ethnic labels rather than "fluid" ones{278]languagesmain article: languages of mexicothe country has the largest
