citysee also: timeline of new york cityetymologyin 1664 the city was named after then duke of york and future king of england james ii james had been named by his older brother charles ii as proprietor of the former territory of new netherlands and its main city of new amsterdam which had recently been seized from the dutchearly historyduring the wisconsinan glaciation the new york city region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet that scraped away regolith leaving the bedrock that is the geologic foundation for much of new york city today later on movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation of what are now long island and staten island{74]in the precolonial era the area of present-day new york city was inhabited by algonquian native americans including the lenape whose homeland known as lenapehoking included staten island; the western portion of long island including the area that would become brooklyn and queens; manhattan; the bronx; and the lower hudson valley{75]the first documented visit into new york harbor by a european was in 1524 by giovanni da verrazzano a florentine explorer in the service of the french crown he claimed the area for france and named it nouvelle angoulxc3xaame (new angoulxc3xaame){76]peter minuit is credited with the purchase of the island of manhattan in 1626a spanish expedition led by captain estxc3xaavxc3xa3o gomes a portuguese sailing for emperor charles v arrived in new york harbor in january 1525 and charted the mouth of the hudson river which he named rxc3xado de san antonio (saint anthony's river) the padrxc3xb3n real of 1527 the first scientific map to show north america's east coast continuously was informed by gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern us as tierra de esteban gxc3xb3mez in his honor{77]in 1609 the english explorer henry hudson rediscovered the new york harbor while searching for the northwest passage to the orient for the dutch east india company he proceeded to sail up what the dutch would name the north river (now the hudson river) named first by hudson as the mauritius after maurice prince of orange hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish"{78] hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north{79] past the site of present-day albany in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue{78] he made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the dutch east india company in 1614 the area between cape cod and delaware bay would be claimed by the netherlands and called nieuw-nederland (new netherland)the first non-native american inhabitant of what would eventually become new york city was juan rodriguez (transliterated to dutch as jan rodrigues) a merchant from santo domingo born in santo domingo of portuguese and african descent he arrived in manhattan during the winter of 1613xe2x80x931614 trapping for pelts and

in the eventual lower manhattan in 1664 the year england took control and renamed it "new york"dutch rulea permanent european presence in new netherland began in 1624 xe2x80x93 making new york the 12th oldest continuously occupied european-established settlement in the continental united states{82] xe2x80x93 with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island in 1625 construction was started on a citadel and fort amsterdam on manhattan island later called nieuw amsterdam (new amsterdam){83]{84] the colony of new amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become lower manhattan in 1626 the dutch colonial director-general peter minuit acting as charged by the dutch west india company purchased the island of manhattan from the canarsie a small lenape band{85] for 60 guilders{86] (about 1000 in 2006){87] a disproved legend claims that manhattan was purchased for 24 worth of glass beads{88]{89]following the purchase new amsterdam grew slowly{90] to attract settlers the dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628 whereby wealthy dutchmen ("patroons" or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to new netherland would be awarded swathes of land along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade this program had little success{91]since 1621 the dutch west india company had operated as a monopoly in new netherland on authority granted by the dutch states general in 1639xe2x80x931640 in an effort to bolster economy growth the dutch west india company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade leading to growth in the production and trade of food timber tobacco and slaves (particularly with the dutch west indies){90]{92]in 1647 peter stuyvesant began his tenure as the last director-general of new netherland during his tenure the population of new amsterdam grew from 2000 to 8000 stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader he instituted regulations on liquor sales attempted to assert control over the dutch reformed church and blocked other religious groups (including quakers jews and lutherans) from establishing houses of worship{93] the dutch west india company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between stuyvesant and residents of new amsterdam{94]english rulein 1664 unable to summon any significant resistance stuyvesant surrendered new amsterdam to english troops led by colonel richard nicolls without bloodshed{93]{94] the terms of the surrender permitted dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom{95] the english promptly renamed the fledgling city "new york" after the duke of york (the future king james ii of england){96] the transfer was confirmed

at the behest of cornelis evertsen the youngest and rechristened it "new orange" after william iii the prince of orange the dutch would soon return the island to england under the treaty of westminster of november 1674{98]{99]several intertribal wars among the native americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the europeans caused sizable population losses for the lenape between the years 1660 and 1670{100] by 1700 the lenape population had diminished to 200{101] new york experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century losing ten percent of its

to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties{110]{111] together with slaves freed by their masters after the revolutionary war and escaped slaves a significant free-black population gradually developed in manhattan under such influential united states founders as alexander hamilton and john jay the new york manumission society worked for abolition and established the african free school to educate black children{112] it was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination new york interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the african free school the city's black population reached more than 16000 in 1840{113]in the 19th century the city was

consistently elected to local office increasing the city's ties to the south and its dominant party in 1861 mayor fernando wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from albany and the united states after the south seceded but his proposal was not acted on{112] anger at new military conscription laws during the american civil war (1861xe2x80x931865) which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a 300 (equivalent to 5835 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute{119] led to the draft riots of 1863 whose most visible participants were ethnic irish working class{112] the situation deteriorated into attacks on new york's elite followed by attacks on black new yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between irish immigrants and black people for work rioters burned the colored orphan asylum to the ground with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the new york city police department which was mainly made up of irish

roof-mounted water towers in the 1800s the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations which could break municipal water pipes{166] garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas such as jackson heights{167]according to the united states geological survey an updated analysis of seismic hazard in july 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in new york city than previously assessed scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower
