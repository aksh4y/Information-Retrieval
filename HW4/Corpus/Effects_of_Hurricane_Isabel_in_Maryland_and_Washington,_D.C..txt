washington dc were among the most damaging from a tropical cyclone in the baltimore-washington metropolitan area united states hurricane isabel formed from a tropical wave on september 6 2003 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165xc2xa0mph (265xc2xa0kmh) on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next dayon september 19 tropical storm isabel passed through extreme western maryland though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state{1] about 124xc2xa0million people lost power throughout the state the worst of its effects came from its storm surge which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion on the eastern shore hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed primarily in queen anne's county from tidal flooding thousands of houses were affected in central maryland with severe storm surge flooding reported in baltimore and annapolis washington dc sustained moderate damage primarily from the winds throughout maryland and washington damage totaled about 945xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (123xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd){1] with only one fatality due to floodingcontents1 preparations2 impact21 eastern shore22 central maryland221 effects by

ocean as a category 5 hurricane forecasters predicted the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130xc2xa0miles (210xc2xa0km) east-southeast of ocean city maryland as a 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) major hurricane{2] by four days before isabel made landfall most computer models predicted isabel to make landfall between north carolina and new jersey{3]{4] on september 16 about two days before the hurricane struck land the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for the southern region of the maryland coastline on the chesapeake bay later that day a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern maryland coastline which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24xc2xa0hours before landfall{1]officials recommended the citizens on smith island to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall the only evacuations for the eastern shore of maryland mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in calvert st mary's and charles counties and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in howard county officials recommended residents in flood areas of baltimore county to evacuate and some in the city of baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding evacuation rates were low throughout the maryland coastline with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore the primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane between 20 and 33 of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated of those who left most went to the house of a friend or family member with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall in most areas the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal the most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees inadequate signage flooded roads or stalled cars in all 3080xc2xa0people evacuated their homes in preparation for hurricane isabel{5] boats trucks and school buses helped more than 1000xc2xa0people evacuate the inner harbor of baltimore as well{6]washington dc mayor anthony williams declared a state of emergency for the district{7] in washington preparations began several days prior to the arrival of the hurricane including placing sandbags in flood-prone areas many people including non-emergency government personnel were told to stay home{8] most people in the district took shelter by the time the hurricane passed through the area and the streets across the city were largely empty president george w bush along with abdullah ii of jordan were evacuated from the city to the presidential retreat at camp david{9] most united states congress representatives and members of the department of defense also left the city{10] many buildings including some federal were shut down all three airports in the baltimore-washington metropolitan area were closed with flights into the capital cancelled or diverted many train routes were canceled or delayed{9] and the washington metro and metrobus systems were closed entirely{11] workers at the national zoo prepared by moving animals inside and lowering water levels{10]impact{edit]eastern shore{edit]rainfall from hurricane isabelon the eastern shore of maryland hurricane isabel produced a storm surge peaking at 8xc2xa0feet (24xc2xa0m) on the chesapeake bay in hoopers island and 65xc2xa0feet (2xc2xa0m) on the atlantic coast in ocean city{12] the track of the hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay tolchester beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 791xc2xa0feet (24xc2xa0m) above mean low water{13] rainfall in the maryland portion of the delmarva peninsula reached 32xc2xa0inches (81xc2xa0mm) in steeles neck the large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area including maximum sustained winds of 52xc2xa0mph (84xc2xa0kmh) and a gust of 66xc2xa0mph (106xc2xa0kmh) in cambridge{12]tidal flooding from the storm surge forced residents to evacuate near the bay tidal flooding was reported in and around rock hall chestertown skinners neck piney neck and cliffs city and was carried along the chester river slightly inland the flooding destroyed or damaged over 100 homes vehicles and boats and also destroyed the romancoke pier one of the pre-bay bridge ferry landings which was still in use as a fishing pier at the time the flooding also severely damaged eleven marinas three restaurants four hotels one boat-building business and one marine railway in queen anne's county the hurricane destroyed 37xc2xa0homes greatly damaged 151 and moderately damaged 192 with damage totaling 37xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (482xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) the damage was mainly due to the tidal flooding though four homes were destroyed due to falling trees moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees tree limbs and power lines leaving about 65750xc2xa0homes and businesses without power half of which occurred in cecil county the resulting power outage was described as one of the worst in the history of conectiv energy damage in the eastern shore of maryland totaled about 50xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (651xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){13]central maryland{edit]wind gusts in central maryland peaked at 83xc2xa0mph (134xc2xa0kmh) in silver spring with a location along the patuxent river recording sustained winds of 55xc2xa0mph (88xc2xa0kmh) unofficially rainfall reached 7xc2xa0inches (178xc2xa0mm) in portions of maryland though the highest precipitation amount totaled 321xc2xa0inches (82xc2xa0mm) at the baltimore-washington international airport swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the western shore which peaked at 82xc2xa0feet (25xc2xa0m) in baltimore annapolis also reported a surge of 72xc2xa0feet (22xc2xa0m){1] in many locations the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 chesapeake potomac hurricane throughout central maryland 472xc2xa0buildings and homes were destroyed with 3260 greatly damaged and another 3600 affected in general strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43000xc2xa0tons (39000 t) of salt millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus and millions of gallons of raw sewage into the chesapeake bay{14] one person died as a result of a traffic death in the state{15] property damage totaled 5305xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (691xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) with an additional 190000 (2003xc2xa0usd (247xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd) in crop damage{14] the crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in frederick county the united states department of agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15xe2x80x9330 of the field corn and 10xe2x80x9315 of the soybean crop excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water{16]most coastal areas under 10xc2xa0feet (3xc2xa0m) above sea level experienced severe wave damage{14] the maryland geological survey estimates the waves removed 20 acres (81xc2xa0ha) of sand along the coastline based on an estimate of losses in baltimore county the 20 acres (81000xc2xa0m2) of lost in single day represent about 15 of the total beach loss in an average year the average location lost about 5xc2xa0feet (15xc2xa0m) of beach and throughout the chesapeake bay the erosion deposited about 81000xc2xa0tons (73500xc2xa0t) of sediment into the bay the erosion was irregular however; some locations were unaffected while others experienced greater losses despite that the two locations were similar the erosion and storm surge damaged many bulkheads and after the storm surge retreated into the bay it washed away freestanding structures{17] the passage of isabel resulted in an unusual increase in phytoplankton in the middle portion of the chesapeake bay followed by an abrupt return to normal conditions by early october{18]effects by county{edit]damage to the ferry bridge in hoopersvile marylandsix foot (2xc2xa0m) waves along the coastline of saint mary's county with point lookout state park suffering 3xc2xa0million in damages (2003xc2xa0usd (43xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in the county 2500xc2xa0wharves and piers were destroyed with another 1000xc2xa0moderately damaged resulting in 1025xc2xa0million in monetary damage (2003xc2xa0usd (133xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) the storm surge destroyed the bridge to saint george island by a few hours after the hurricane made landfall and the flooding covered much of the island for a week there 20xc2xa0homes were destroyed shore revetments experienced 534xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd (814xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) throughout saint mary's county residential damage amounted to about 17xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (242xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) with about 15xc2xa0million to commercial buildings (2003xc2xa0usd (195xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) the damage was caused primarily by the storm surge though the winds produced minor to moderate damage the worst effects in the state from winds in the county the winds blew off the roof of a home and downed 70xc2xa0trees leaving 27092 without power{14]in charles county the hurricane resulted in about 2xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (26xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in damage to roads two homes were destroyed with several others damaged on cobb island elsewhere in the county chigger city port tobacco woodland point swan point and morgantown also reported damage from hurricane isabel with 52xc2xa0houses damaged{14] and eight homes destroyed or severely damaged seven businesses were also destroyed or greatly damaged many piers along the shore were damaged or lost and two private community wells were contaminated{19] the winds downed several trees and power lines leaving about 32000xc2xa0people without power residential damage totaled 11xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 12xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd) with another 600000 (2003xc2xa0usd (781xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd) to commercial buildings{14]four to fivexc2xa0foot (12 to 15xc2xa0m) waves hit the eastern portion of calvert county causing a home to be knocked off its foundation in north beach the storm surge destroyed the pier and greatly damaged buildings along the shoreline at solomons island power was lost to 22400xc2xa0residents as a result of the passage of the hurricane{14]the storm surge produced higher than usual tides in along the patuxent potomac and anacostia river coastlines much of the shoreline of prince george's county possessed adequate rise of terrain to prevent significant flooding though the high waters closed three roads where the shoreline was not high enough the passage of the hurricane created about 5000xc2xa0tons (4500xc2xa0t) of debris to be removed fifteen buildings sustained major damage with another 53xc2xa0buildings affected to some degree nearly 200000 residents in the county lost power{14] when two of the largest sewage treatment plants in the state lost power 96xc2xa0million us gallons (360000xc2xa0m3) of hazardous sewage overflowed to mix with storm water into two waterways in the county the wastewater combined with rainwater making it less threatening no humans or animals were known to have become sick due to the overflows{20]in annapolis in anne arundel county the storm surge surrounded many of the buildings at the united states naval academy resulting in about 116xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd (151xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){14] the annapolis maritime museum suffered severe damage as well though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location there the storm surge flooded the building in 6xc2xa0feet (18xc2xa0m) of water causing great damage to the floor drywall and electricity{21] about 93 of the 211000 power customers in the county were left without electricity after the storm fema estimated a damage total of up to 500xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (651xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in the county{14]moderate wave action produced severe beach erosion along the shore of baltimore county at a loss of 3xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (391xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd)) residential areas of millers island edgemere north point bowleys quarters and turners station suffered severe damage from the hurricane with over 400xc2xa0people needing to be rescued over 300xc2xa0buildings were destroyed the storm surge flooding killed a man in dundalk and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas strong winds downed 118xc2xa0trees on school grounds and hundreds of others elsewhere some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220000xc2xa0customers without power the passage of hurricane isabel left 3189xc2xa0tons (2893xc2xa0t) of debris across the county{14]the storm surge flooded fells point and the inner harbor of baltimore causing millions of dollars of damage to waterfront properties{14] as the inner harbor began to flood boat owners helped evacuate 35xc2xa0people in flooded homes winds from isabel destroyed at least three buildings in the city{6] the baltimore museum of industry alone suffered 15xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd (195xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) 70000 were left without power in the city{14]in harford county high waves and the storm surge caused moderate flooding in areas forcing 55 to evacuate along the bush river and 12 to evacuate along the waterfront to havre de grace the promenade boardwalk in havre de grace was destroyed moderate winds left 51600xc2xa0residents in the county without power damage in the county totaled at least 125xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (163xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){14]western maryland{edit]the center of tropical storm isabel passed over garrett county on september 19 with its unusually large and powerful wind field producing 50 to 60xc2xa0mph (80 to 95xc2xa0kmh) wind gusts across western maryland some rainbands produced up to 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) gusts (113xc2xa0kmh) and in some areas isolated streaks of damage were described as being caused by tornadoes rainfall varied between 2 and 4xc2xa0inches (50 to 100xc2xa0mm) across the area resulting in the potomac river overflowing its banks at point of rocks the river crested at 2312xc2xa0feet (7xc2xa0m) 712xc2xa0feet (22xc2xa0m) above flood stage moderate flooding occurred there and minor flooding occurred in paw paw west virginia where the river crested at 291xc2xa0feet (09xc2xa0m) the flooding closed a portion of the chesapeake and ohio canal{22]the gusty winds from the passage of the hurricane resulted in widespread and extensive tree damage due to previous rainfall moist grounds easily allowed for trees to be uprooted wind damage to structures was minor however with one house in carroll county being damaged when a tree fell on it trees fell onto cars roads homes and power lines leaving 358000 without power after the storm 600xc2xa0traffic signals were without power in montgomery county and about 70xc2xa0roads were closed due to fallen trees isabel destroyed 94xc2xa0buildings and damaged 87 including 33xc2xa0homes six of which were severely impacted with one losing a portion of its roof fallen trees injured two in frederick county in western maryland damage totaled 207xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (269xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){22]washington dc{edit]tree and power line damage in washington dcin washington dc sustained winds remained below tropical storm force though gusts reached 71xc2xa0mph (114xc2xa0kmh) as recorded by the national academy of science{1] hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in the air with wind sensors on the top of tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85xc2xa0mph (115 to 135xc2xa0kmh) rainfall was minimal amounting to around two inches across the district a gauge on wisconsin avenue recorded a storm surge of 113xc2xa0feet (34xc2xa0m) and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 1025xc2xa0feet (31xc2xa0m) both observations were records surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 chesapeake potomac hurricane{8]moderate winds blew down about 1600xc2xa0trees in the district{23] 23 of which fell onto houses the united states national arboretum lost many mature trees and azaleas on the bank of the anacostia river the winds also downed many power lines leaving 129000xc2xa0customers without power{8] many streets were blocked by the fallen trees and power lines at the white house the winds downed one tree in the front garden though there was no damage to the building itself{9] the storm surge resulted in flooding at the washington navy yard there the marina was damaged and some buildings and cars in low area garages were flooded five people were rescued from cars in flood waters during the storm and several roads were closed due to the flooding{8] throughout the district the passage of isabel created approximately 30000xc2xa0pounds (13600xc2xa0kg) of debris{23] damage in washington dc totaled 125xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (163xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){8]aftermath{edit]power crews restored 75 of the power outages in the eastern shore of maryland by two days after the hurricane struck and by one week after the hurricane the power was restored completely to the eastern shore{13] buildings in washington dc remained closed for two days after the hurricane{9] after the hurricane several people in central and western maryland were injured with three killed from carbon monoxide due to improperly running generators in their houses additionally others were injured due to chain saws and cleaning up debris{14]{22] in the days after the hurricane the calvert county hospital reported an extra 130 patients per day{14]the strong winds and storm surge of the hurricane dislodged and damaged a large number of home heating oil tanks releasing thousands of gallons of oil onto yards and into the environment the maryland department of the environment and the united states environmental protection agency worked together to recover more than 50000 us gallons (190000xc2xa0l) of oil from the tanks five hundred properties were contaminated by the oil causing the federal emergency management agency to provide 75 of the funding for cleaning the properties with the government of maryland providing for the remainder of the cost{24]on september 19 2003 president george w bush declared the entire state of maryland as a disaster area which allowed residents affected by the hurricane to apply for federal aid fema officials urged residents and business owners with significant damage to call as soon as possible while those with minimal damage were asked to wait for a few days all residents in the state who received damage from the storm had sixty days to apply for assistance{25] federal and state officials opened disaster recovery centers in annapolis baltimore essex and prince frederick five days after the hurricane passed through the area with the centers designed to provide more information to those who applied for federal assistance{26]{27] about six days after isabel made landfall additional disaster recovery centers opened in rock hall in kent county{28] california in saint mary's county{29] silver spring in montgomery county{30] chester in queen anne's county{31] crisfield in somerset county{32] cambridge in dorchester county{33] and easton in talbot county{34] around a month after the hurricane officials placed some residents unable to live in their damaged homes into travel trailers because they had no options for alternate housing such as staying with a relative or friend{35]on september 26 the affected residents began receiving housing assistance grants totaling 43xc2xa0million in aid{36] by a month after the hurricane passed through the area disaster aid amounted to just over 30xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (391xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){37] ultimately aid in the state totalled just under 100xc2xa0million (130xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) business owners applied for 14595xc2xa0loans and received 534xc2xa0million (695xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in low interest loans from the small business administration the state also received more than 169xc2xa0million in funds (2003xc2xa0usd (22xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) to rebuild infrastructure damaged by isabel 17855xc2xa0residents applied to receive more than 208xc2xa0million (271xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in housing assistance and 8xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd (104xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in assistance for other needs such as personal property transportation and medical expenses{38]president bush also declared washington dc as a disaster area two days after isabel passed through the area{39] the united states department of agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks for the city to ensure those who lost food as a result of the hurricane would not go hungry{40] by eight days after the hurricane the department of employment services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of isabel{41] by 11xc2xa0days after isabel the government approved 521xc2xa0million in disaster assistance (2003xc2xa0usd 678xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) the us army corps of engineers delivered nearly 800000xc2xa0pounds (363000xc2xa0kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the district suffering from power outages various groups joined to provide more than 15000xc2xa0meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages{42] volunteers assisted in distributing 515xc2xa0tons (467xc2xa0t) of ice along with 21000 sandbags throughout the district{43] officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district{44] ultimately nearly 1500xc2xa0residents in the district applied for federal assistance with fema providing the residents more than 600000 in aid (2003xc2xa0usd (781xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd){45]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of
