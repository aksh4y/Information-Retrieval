categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on septemberxc2xa013 2010categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach categoryxc2xa04 intensity on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes that later attained categoryxc2xa05 strength are not included in this list the atlantic basin includes the open waters of the atlantic ocean the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico categoryxc2xa04 is the second-highest hurricane classification category on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale and storms that are of this intensity maintain maximum sustained winds of 113xe2x80x93136xc2xa0knots (130xe2x80x93156xc2xa0mph 209xe2x80x93251xc2xa0kmh) based on the atlantic hurricane database 94xc2xa0hurricanes have attained categoryxc2xa04 hurricane status since 1851 the start of modern meteorological record keeping categoryxc2xa04 storms are considered extreme hurricanes hurricane ike which was a categoryxc2xa04 storm brought on a 24xc2xa0ft storm surge the third greatest storm surge ever recorded (after hurricane katrina and hurricane camille respectively)contents1 statistics2 meteorological measurements3 climatology4 list of category 4 hurricanes41 listed in

referencesstatistics{edit]categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes have maximum sustained winds of 113xe2x80x93136xc2xa0knots (130xe2x80x93156xc2xa0mph 209xe2x80x93251xc2xa0kmh){1] "sustained winds" refers to the average wind speed observed over one minute at a height of 10xc2xa0meters (33xc2xa0ft) above ground gust can be 30 higher than the sustained winds{2] mobile homes and other buildings without fixed structures can be completely destroyed and the lower floors of sturdier structures usually sustain major damage in addition to the winds the cyclones generally produce a storm surge of 13xe2x80x9318xc2xa0feet (4xe2x80x9355xc2xa0m) above normal potentially causing major beach erosion heavy irreparable damage andor near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are also very common and mobile and manufactured homes are often completely destroyed low-level terrain may be flooded well inland as well{3] in addition categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes are very often cape verde type hurricanes cape verde hurricanes are usually the strongest and their track sometimes points them towards the united states or other land{4]studies have shown that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes nearly doubled in occurrence in from 1970 to 2004{5] also due to growing population in major coastal cities many areas have become more vulnerable to strong hurricanes especially categories 4 and 5{6]meteorological measurements{edit]all of the storms listed in this analysis are listed in chronological order but they also list the minimum central pressure and maximum sustained winds each of these meteorological readings are taken using a specific meteorological instrument for modern storms the minimum pressure measurements are taken by reconnaissance aircraft using dropsondes or by determining it from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique for older storms pressures are often incomplete typically being provided by ship-reports or land-observations none of these methods can provide constant pressure measurements; thus it is possible the only measurement occurred when the cyclone was at a lesser strength{7] sustained winds are taken using an anemometer at 10xc2xa0meters (33xc2xa0ft) above the ground{8]climatology{edit]a total of 95xc2xa0hurricanes in the atlantic ocean basin including the gulf of mexico and the caribbean have reached categoryxc2xa04 status as their peak intensity (note that categoryxc2xa04 storms that intensified later to category 5 status are not included in this analysis)most categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes occur during september with 51xc2xa0storms occurring in that month this coincides with the average peak of the atlantic hurricane season which occurs on september 10{9] most categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes develop in the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea several categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes are cape verde-type hurricanes there have been no categoryxc2xa04 hurricanes to form in either may or december or in any other month outside the traditional bounds of the atlantic hurricane seasonlist of category 4 hurricanes{edit]listed in chronological order{edit]all data listed is provided by the nhc best track unless otherwise noted also some pressure readings for the older storms may have been taken at a time other than the storm's peak intensity thus some pressure readings might not be the minimum pressuresome pressure readings are unavailable due to scarce informationhurricane frequencyperiodnumbernumber per
