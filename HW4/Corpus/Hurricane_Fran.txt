september 1996 the sixth named storm fifth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season fran developed from a tropical wave near cape verde on august 23 due to nearby hurricane edouard the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward though it eventually intensified into tropical storm fran on august 27 while heading west-northwestward fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on august 29 but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day on august 31 fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane by september 2 fran began to parallel the islands of the bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward fran peaked as a 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) category 3 hurricane by early on september 5 thereafter fran weakened slightly before it made landfall near cape fear north carolina early on september 6 the storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day eventually fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over ontario early on september 9in florida high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard though all were rescued no significant effects were reported in georgia the outerbands of fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in south carolina as a result numerous trees and powerlines were downed which damaged cars left over 63000 people without electricity large waves in north carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities overall fran was attributed to 27 fatalities and 32 billion (1996 usd) in damage fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the carolinas as a major hurricane{1]{2]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations21 lesser antilles and the bahamas22 florida23 georgia3 impact31 florida

external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalehurricane fran originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of africa entering the atlantic ocean on augustxc2xa022 1996 not long after moving over water convective banding features formed around a developing area of low pressure ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day after further development the national hurricane center (nhc) initiated advisories on the system around 8:00xc2xa0am edt on augustxc2xa023 designating it as tropical depression six at this time the depression was situated to the southeast of the cape verde islands over the following several days little development took place as the system moved westward at 17xc2xa0mph (27xc2xa0kmh) the westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from hurricane edouard located roughly 850xc2xa0mi (1370xc2xa0km) west-northwest of the depression{3]by augustxc2xa026 the depression had become significantly disorganized prompting the nhc to issue their initial final advisory on the system{4] the following day satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation leading to the re-issuance of advisories{5] however post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24xe2x80x91hour span during the afternoon of augustxc2xa027 the depression intensified further becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name fran at this time tropical storm fran was located about 1000xc2xa0mi (1600xc2xa0km) east of the lesser antilles following a similar track as edouard the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength{3]colorized infrared image of fran near peak intensity east of the northern bahamas and floridafollowing the development of deep convection around fran's center of circulation on augustxc2xa029 the nhc upgraded it to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane the lowest ranking on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) however the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on augustxc2xa030 as it became less organized possibly due to an interaction with hurricane edouard to the north during this time the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track however this weakening was short-lived and fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as edouard moved towards the mid-atlantic coastline the storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a subtropical ridge to the north strengthened{3]infrared image of fran making landfall near cape fear north carolina on septemberxc2xa05gradual intensification took place for the first several days of september with fran attaining winds of 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) on septemberxc2xa03 by this point the storm began to develop an eye and a more rapid phase of strengthening took place early the next day fran attained category 3 intensity as its maximum sustained winds increased to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) a more northwesterly track also began to appear as it approached the bahamas passing roughly 115xc2xa0mi (185xc2xa0km) east of the bahamas fran attained its peak intensity on septemberxc2xa05 with winds of 120xc2xa0mih (195xc2xa0kmh) and a barometric pressure of 946xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2794xc2xa0inhg) the eye of fran was roughly 29xc2xa0mi (47xc2xa0km) in diameter at this time{3]a large hurricane the storm's forward motion increased as it moved northwest towards the carolinas around 7:30xc2xa0 pm edt on thursday septemberxc2xa05{6] the center of hurricane fran made landfall near cape fear north carolina with sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) once overland the storm began to rapidly weaken degrading to a tropical storm within 12xc2xa0hours as the weakening storm moved through virginia the nhc further downgraded it to a tropical depression continuing on a northwestern track the remnants of fran persisted as a tropical depression through septemberxc2xa08 at which time it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over southern ontario after completing this transition fran turned northeastward and tracked near the canadian-united states border before being absorbed by a frontal system on septemberxc2xa010{3]preparations{edit]lesser antilles and the bahamas{edit]generalhurricane warninghurricane conditionsexpected within 36 hourshurricane watchhurricane

of the lesser antilles on august 29 a hurricane watch was issued for the northernmost of the islands between antigua and saint martin{7] however as the hurricane weakened and pulled away from the islands to the northwest the watch was discontinued at the same time a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was declared for the central bahamas on september 3 the hurricane watch was extended to include the northern bahamas and a hurricane warning was declared for the northwestern islands all watches for the bahamas were cancelled on september 4{7] no preparations were taken by the government of the bahamas in anticipation of fran{8]florida{edit]early in its span hurricane fran was forecast to heavily impact florida and multiple watches and warnings were issued for the state as hurricane fran neared the united states{7] as the hurricane progressively moved further to the north watches and warnings imposed on florida continued to move further north along the coast on september 4 a tropical storm warning was issued but only from brunswick georgia to flagler beach florida located in the northern parts of the state all watches and warnings on the state were discontinued by september 5{citation needed]before the hurricane neared the coast civil defense authorities conducted statewide conference calls in order to create preliminary plans in case fran caused impacts on florida{9] in addition beach patrols were kept on high alert as fran generated large waves on the florida beaches{10]georgia{edit]the first hurricane watches and warnings for georgia were first imposed on september 4 as hurricane fran became a major hurricane with a watch extending from florida through georgia and into south carolina{7] the watch was upgraded to a warning later that day as fran moved closer to the coast while areas south of brunswick georgia were only issued a tropical storm warning areas north of the city were declared under a hurricane warning until september 5 when it was downgraded into a tropical storm warning all watches and warnings on the georgia coast were discontinued by the end of september 6on september 4 while much of georgia was under a hurricane watch multiple emergency operation centers were activated when the watch was upgraded the state declared a mandatory evacuation for chatham county while liberty county issued a voluntary evacuation order for its residents{7] the state's electric membership corporations began cooperating with other utility companies in preparation for the storm{11]impact{edit]impact by area

heavy rainfall leading to widespread flash flooding and wind damage the most severe damage took place in north carolina where 14 people died one of which was from a heart attack and the storm left 24xc2xa0billion in losses throughout other states 13 other people lost their lives and an additional 800xc2xa0million in damage was caused overall hurricane fran was directly responsible for 22 fatalities and indirectly for five others as well as 32xc2xa0billion in damage at the time fran was one of the ten costliest hurricanes to strike the united states; however several other storms have since surpassed itflorida and south carolina{edit]prior to moving over the carolinas large swells produced by hurricane fran impacted the florida coastline along the beaches of palm beach county five people aboard an 18xc2xa0ft (55xc2xa0m) fishing boat were knocked into the water by the rough seas however the coast guard rescued all five persons without incident{12]as fran made landfall in north carolina the outer bands of the storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to eastern south carolina several areas reported winds in excess of 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) leading to numerous downed trees and power lines some cars and homes were damaged after being struck by fallen trees{13] in dillon county winds gusting up to 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) caused significant damage to many homes debris was left in the wake of fran across the county than during hurricane hugo in 1989 one person was injured and damage to crops and infrastructure reached 65xc2xa0million{14] in marlboro county roughly 3200 people were left without power and two sheriffs were injured after their car struck a fallen tree{15] the most severe damage in south carolina took place in horry county where winds reached 77xc2xa0mph (124xc2xa0kmh) numerous trees were felled by the winds leaving roughly 60000 residents without power one person was killed after her car fell down an embankment extensive agricultural losses were sustained in the area estimated at 198xc2xa0million structural damage was less severe with losses estimated at 1xc2xa0million{16] a second car-related fatality during fran took place in williamsburg county{17] combined economic losses in berkeley and charleston counties reached 20xc2xa0million{18] throughout south carolina fran was responsible for two fatalities five injuries and roughly 485xc2xa0million in damagenorth carolina{edit]a home destroyed by fran along the north carolina coastlinefran caused coastal damage from the south carolina border to topsail island north carolina its 12-foot storm surge carried away a temporary north topsail beach police station and town hall housed in a double-wide trailer since hurricane bertha's rampage across the same area in july the kure beach pier was destroyed during the storm as well extensive flooding struck the coast around wrightsville beach just up the coast from cape fear in jacksonville north carolina three schools and several homes were damaged the storm was most damaging to the barrier islands on the north carolina coastlineinland the storm caused damage on its way north from wilmington to raleigh unexpectedly high wind damage extended along the i-40 corridor up through raleigh and points north and as far west as guilford county damaging historic buildings and trees throughout the triangle including at north carolina state university and the university of north carolina{19] classes were canceled for the day at unc due to a state of emergency in chapel hill and it was almost a week before the university's water supply was drinkable againrain of up to 16 inches (406xc2xa0mm) deluged interior north carolina virginia and west virginia{20] bringing dangerous river flooding to much of the mid-atlantic hurricane fran's thrashing of north carolina aggravated the state's problems caused by numerous weather disasters in 1996at least six people were killed in the carolinas; most of them were from auto accidents and more died as a result of the shock from the damage of the storm in north carolina 13 million people were left without power in north topsail beach and carteret county there was over 500xc2xa0million (1996xc2xa0usd) in damage and 90 of structures were damaged{21] one male teenager died from drowning caused by flooding of crabtree creek at old lassiter mill in raleigh fran also destroyed the basketball gym on the campus of st andrews college in laurinburg north carolina hurricane fran also destroyed 3 piers in surf cityrainfall from hurricane fran in the united statestotal damage in north carolina amounted to roughly 24 billion{citation needed]this was the second hurricane to hit north carolina that year the first was hurricane bertha which hit the state a few weeks prior{citation needed]virginia{edit]in virginia winds between 39 and 73xc2xa0mph (63 and 117xc2xa0kmh) lashed chesapeake bay and increased water levels in the potomac river around the nation's capital where it backed up into georgetown and old town alexandria virginia there was severe damage to power lines that left 415000 people without electricity making it the largest storm related power outage in history until hurricane isabel in 2003{21] along the rappahannock river a storm surge of 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) damaged or sank several small boats and damaged wharfs and bulkheads this was the highest tide in the state since hurricane hazel of 1954{21]rain up to 16xc2xa0in (410xc2xa0mm) fell in the western part of virginia making fran the fourth wettest known tropical cyclone to impact virginia and causing major flash flooding the floods shut down many of the primary and secondary roads and closed shenandoah national park fran destroyed about 300 homes mostly from flooding and 100 people had to be rescuedpage county downslope of the 16" of rainfall from big meadows was the hardest hit locality in the state of virginia with regards to damage three days after the storm had passed "hundreds" of people were still stranded some 78 homes were destroyed and 417 were damaged however there were no deaths at one point on friday every town in the county was isolated due to high water{22] in the county seat of luray the hawksbill creek cut the town in half for much of the day and the strong current forced a house off its foundation and placed in the endzone of luray high school's football field water from the hawksbill reached 2xc2xa0ft (061xc2xa0m) from the top of the field goal uprightxe2x80x94 16xc2xa0ft (49xc2xa0m) of water covered the ground bulldog field was flooded for over a week after the storm until finally the standing water was pumped across us route 340 back into the hawksbill creek also in downtown luray the large flood-driven waves of the creek demolished three buildings including the adelphia cable building the creek typically less than a foot deep overtook the downtown main street bridge which rises some 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) above the creek bed{23]the shenandoah river crested some 20xc2xa0ft (61xc2xa0m) above flood stage the south fork of the shenandoah river recorded its highest crests ever 2695xc2xa0ft (821xc2xa0m) in luray and 37xc2xa0ft (11xc2xa0m) in front royal virginia which was 22xc2xa0ft (67xc2xa0m) above the 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) flood stage{24]in rockingham county virginia over 10000 people were evacuated from their homes however most were allowed to return to their homes after the water subsided{25]west virginia{edit]most severe landfalling atlantic hurricanes in the united statesbased on size and

and caused a reported gas leak{21]maryland{edit]western maryland was hard hit by fran mostly from flash flooding about 650 homes were damaged and there was 100xc2xa0million (1996xc2xa0usd) in damage this was the worst flooding event to hit maryland since hurricane hazel and the january flood of 1996{21]district of columbia{edit]in the capital city the district of columbia fran produced gusty winds and moderate rainfall gusts in the area were recorded in excess of 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) and rainfall peaked near 35xc2xa0in (89xc2xa0mm) minor flash flooding was reported on many streets hampering travel and leaving several roads were closed{27] these winds downed several trees in saturated soil{28] a strong southerly wind and high tide led to a 51xc2xa0ft (16xc2xa0m) storm surge in washington harbor{29] in addition to the storm surge a river flood rivaling that of the january 1996 flood took place in the metropolitan area{30] throughout washington dc fran left roughly 20xc2xa0million in damage{21]pennsylvania{edit]about 15 western pennsylvania counties were hit by flash flooding as rainfall up to 7xc2xa0inches (178xc2xa0mm) caused the juniata river to overrun its banks{20]ohio michigan new england and canada{edit]the remnants of fran brought moderate to heavy rainfall to parts of eastern ohio especially along the coast of lake erie as the storm moved through the region{20] a maximum of 647xc2xa0in (164xc2xa0mm) of rain fell near elyria in relation to fran{31] sustained winds in the state were recorded around 30xc2xa0mph (48xc2xa0kmh) and gusts reached 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) these winds downed numerous trees and power lines some of which fell on cars and homes agricultural land and the region sustained significant damage{32] in cleveland the city zoo sustained some flood damage and the monkey island was completely inundated{33] in cuyahoga county at least 90 homes reported basement flooding{34] widespread street and basement flooding took place across lorain county with some areas reporting standing water several days after fran's passage{35] throughout ohio the remnants of fran left roughly 40xc2xa0million in damage and no loss of life{3]{36]continuing northward fran moved into southern canada on septemberxc2xa07; however the outer bands of the storm brought some rainfall to extreme eastern michigan in port huron a state maximum amount of 407xc2xa0in (103xc2xa0mm) of rain fell during the storm's passage{31] no known flooding or damage took place throughout the state{36] turning northeast and becoming extratropical fran brought scattered rainfall to parts of new england a small area around boston massachusetts received the heaviest rain in the region peaking at 553xc2xa0in (140xc2xa0mm) in east wareham isolated areas of 1 to 2xc2xa0in (25 to 51xc2xa0mm) of rain fell across portions of vermont new hampshire and maine before fran dissipated over eastern canada on septemberxc2xa08{37] in nearby southern canada the remnants of fran had little impact in ontario other than causing rain delays in a minor t-ball tournament producing light to moderate rainfall between 18 and 26xc2xa0in (45 and 65xc2xa0mm){38]aftermath{edit]a sign put up by a resident of north carolina topsail island following the severe damage from franthe cape fear river watershed was devastated by fran severe water quality problems persisted for weeks the northeast cape fear river suffered a massive fish kill sewage treatment plant failures led to millions of liters of raw and partially treated human sewage to flow into area rivers dissolved oxygen content fell to nearly zero across the cape fear and northeast cape fear rivers for over three weeks which led to hypoxia in the cape fear estuary for several weeks ammonium and phosphorus levels increased with concentrations of phosphorus reaching a 27-year high{39]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the damage in
