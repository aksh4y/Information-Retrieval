is a current event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone and subtropical cyclone formation it officially began on november 1 2017 and will end officially on april 30 2018 with the exception for mauritius and the seychelles for which it will end on may 15 2018 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin which is west of 90xc2xb0e and south of the equator tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the regional specialised meteorological centre in rxc3xa9unioncontents1 seasonal summary2

the australian bureau of meteorology{1] moved west-southwest across the 90th meridian east into the southwest indian ocean basin on august 8{2] at 10:00 utc the following day mxc3xa9txc3xa9o-france rxc3xa9union upgraded the low-pressure system to a zone of disturbed weather with sustained winds of up to 55 kmh (35 mph) being detected on the southern side of the circulation by scatterometer{3] at this time the disturbance was located approximately 2375 km (1475 mi) west of jakarta indonesia{3] mxc3xa9txc3xa9o-france noted that the revival of convective activity in the basin was likely due to the interaction between an eastwards-moving kelvin wave and a westwards-moving rossby wave{3]storm names{edit]within the south-west indian ocean tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) by the regional specialized meteorological center on la rxc3xa9union island france (rsmc la rxc3xa9union) are usually assigned a name however it is the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory centers in mauritius and madagascar who name the systems the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory center in mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55xc2xb0e and 90xc2xb0e if instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30xc2xb0e and 55xc2xb0e then the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory center in madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm beginning from the 2016xe2x80x9317 season name lists within the south-west indian ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis storm names are only used once so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2020xe2x80x9321 season the unused names are expected to be reused in the list for the 2020xe2x80x9321
