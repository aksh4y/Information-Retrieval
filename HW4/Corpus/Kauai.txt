reached the hawaixcaxbbian islands he named the archipelago after his patron the 6th earl of sandwich george montagu{5]during the reign of king kamehameha the islands of kauaxcaxbbi and nixcaxbbihau were the last hawaixcaxbbian islands to join his kingdom of hawaixcaxbbi their ruler kaumualixcaxbbi resisted kamehameha for years king kamehameha twice prepared a huge armada of ships and canoes to take the islands by force and twice failed; once due to a storm and once due to an epidemic in the face of the threat of a further invasion however kaumualixcaxbbi decided to join the kingdom without bloodshed and became kamehameha's vassal in 1810 he ceded the island to the kingdom of hawaixcaxbbi upon his death in 1824{5]schxc3xa4ffer affair{edit]main article: schxc3xa4ffer affairin 1815 a ship from the russian-american company was wrecked on the island in 1816 an agreement was signed by kaumualixcaxbbi to allow the russians to build fort elizabeth it was an attempt by kaumualixe2x80x99i to gain support from the russians against kamehameha i construction was begun in 1817 but in july of that year under mounting resistance of native hawaiians and american traders the russians were expelledold sugar mill of koloa{edit]main article: old sugar mill of koloain 1835 old koloa town opened a sugar mill{5] from 1906 to 1934 the office of county clerk was held by john mahixcaxbbai kxc4x81neakua who had been active in attempts to restore queen liliuokalani to the throne after the united states takeover of hawaixcaxbbi in 1893{6]etymology and language{edit]hawaiian narrative locates the name's origin in the legend of hawaixcaxbbiloa the polynesian navigator credited with discovery of the hawaixcaxbbian islands the story relates how he named the island of kauaxcaxbbi after a favorite son; a possible translation of kauaxcaxbbi is "place around the neck" describing how a father would carry a favorite child another possible translation is "food season"{7]kauaxcaxbbi was known for its distinct dialect of the hawaiian language; this survives on nixcaxbbihau while the standard language today adopts the dialect of hawaixcaxbbi island which has the sound {k] the kauaxcaxbbi dialect was known for pronouncing this as {t] in effect kauaxcaxbbi dialect retained the old pan-polynesian t while "standard" hawaixcaxbbi dialect has changed it to the {k]{clarification needed] therefore the native name for kauaxcaxbbi was said as tauaxcaxbbi and the major settlement of kapaxcaxbba would have been pronounced as tapaxcaxbbageography{edit]kalalau beachkauaxcaxbbi's origins are volcanic the island having been formed by the passage of the pacific plate over the hawaii hotspot at approximately six million years old it is the oldest of the main islands the highest peak on this mountainous island is kawaikini at 5243 feet (1598xc2xa0m){8]the second highest peak is mount waixcaxbbalexcaxbbale near the center of the island 5148xc2xa0ft (1569xc2xa0m) above sea level one of the wettest spots on earth with an annual average rainfall of 460 inches (1200xc2xa0cm) is located on the east side of mount waixcaxbbalexcaxbbale the high annual rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains carving out canyons with many scenic waterfalls on the west side of the island waimea town is located at the mouth of the waimea river whose flow formed waimea canyon one of the world's most scenic canyons which is part of waimea canyon state park at 3000xc2xa0ft (914xc2xa0m) deep waimea canyon is often referred to as "the grand canyon of the pacific" kokeo point lies on the south side of the island the na pali coast is a center for recreation in a wild setting including kayaking past the beaches or hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs{9] the headland kuahonu point is on the south-east of the islandclimate{edit]kauaxcaxbbixe2x80x99s climate is tropical with generally humid and stable conditions year round although weather phenomena and infrequent storms have caused instances of extreme weather at the lower elevations the annual precipitation varies from an average of about 50 inches on the windward (northeastern) shore to less than 20 inches on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island average temperature in lihu'e the county seat ranges from 78xc2xa0xc2xb0f (26xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in february to 85xc2xa0xc2xb0f (29xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in august

has been disputed based on data for the period from 1931 through 1960 the average yearly precipitation was 460xc2xa0in (12000xc2xa0mm) (us environmental science services administration 1968) between 1949 and 2004 the average yearly precipitation at mt waixcaxbbalexcaxbbale was 374xc2xa0in (9500xc2xa0mm){11]not only does kauaxcaxbbi hold a record in average yearly precipitation it also holds a

precipitation in just 60 minutes the 12xc2xa0in (300xc2xa0mm) value for one hour is an underestimate since the rain gauge overflowed which may have resulted in an error by as much as an inch{12] an accurate measurement may have exceeded holt missouri's world record 60-minute rainfall of 12 inches in 42 minutes on june 22 1947{13]time zone{edit]hawaii standard time is observed on kauaxcaxbbi
