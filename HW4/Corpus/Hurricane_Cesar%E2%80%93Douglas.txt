guatemala el salvadorpart of the 1996 atlantic andpacific hurricane seasonshurricane cesarxe2x80x93douglas was one of the few tropical cyclones to survive the crossover from the atlantic to east pacific basin and was the last to receive two names upon doing so cesar was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season the system formed in the southern caribbean sea and affected several countries in south america before crossing nicaragua and entering the eastern pacific where it was renamed douglas the storm killed 113 people in central and south america and left 29 others missing mainly due to flooding and mudslidescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 lesser antilles and south america32 nicaragua33 costa rica34 el salvador35 mexico4 aftermath5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of hurricane cesar were from a tropical wave and an elongated area of low pressure that emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa on julyxc2xa017 for several days the wave moved westward without any organization although an anticyclone aloft provided conditions favorable for development on julyxc2xa022 convection or thunderstorms increased along the wave as it approached the southern windward islands surface pressure steadily dropped as the system moved through the lesser antilles and a circulation began developing near trinidad and tobago based on surface and satellite data it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression three at 1800xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa024 near isla margarita off the north coast of venezuela{1] operationally the national hurricane center (nhc) did not consider it as a tropical depression until 18xc2xa0hours later{1]{2]with an unusually strong high pressure area located over the bahamas the tropical depression moved westward through the southern caribbean near the northern coast of south america around 1200xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa025 it struck the island of curaxc3xa7ao which reported sustained winds of 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) the observation indicated the depression attained tropical storm status{1] although operationally the depression wasn't upgraded until the next day at which point the nhc named the storm cesar{2] after crossing curaxc3xa7ao the storm moved near or over guajira peninsula in extreme northern colombia its proximity to south america prevented significant strengthening until late on julyxc2xa026 when the storm reached the open waters of the southwest caribbean sea{1]cesar making landfall in nicaraguaon julyxc2xa027 cesar attained hurricane status about halfway between nicaragua and colombia later that day the hurricane passed over san andrxc3xa9s island which is part of a small colombian archipelago off the east coast of nicaragua as cesar approached central america a 17xc2xa0mile (19xc2xa0km) eye formed surrounded by deep convection in the form of an eyewall at about 0400xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa028 hurricane cesar made landfall just north of bluefields nicaragua with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) it moved quickly west-northward through the country weakening to tropical storm status and emerging into the eastern pacific ocean by julyxc2xa029{1] this made cesar the most recent tropical cyclone to traverse from the atlantic to east pacific basin until otto achieved the same feat in 2016{3] in addition following the dissipation of cesarxe2x80x93douglas there was a policy change which determined that future storms would retain their original name upon crossing into another basin{4] upon reaching the pacific the system was renamed tropical depression seven-e{5] but in a post-analysis it was determined the cyclone maintained tropical storm status while crossing central america{1] once its status as a tropical storm was confirmed it was renamed tropical storm douglas at the time the agreement through the world meteorological organization was for storms to be renamed if they cross from the atlantic to the pacific{6]as the storm moved westward it quickly intensified with an eye-like feature developing by 0900xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa029{7] shortly thereafter douglas attained hurricane status about 115xc2xa0mi (185xc2xa0km) southwest of the guatemalamexico border{6] around that time tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated two scenarios for the future of douglas; one was a northwest track to make landfall near acapulco and the other was a continued west-northwest track while remaining offshore{8] hurricane douglas ultimately took the latter track{6] by late on julyxc2xa029 the eye of the hurricane was well-defined on mexican radar and with favorable upper-level outflow warm sea surface temperatures and a climatologically favorable region for intense hurricanes the nhc forecast douglas to strengthen to winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){9] the next day its structure became atypical of a strengthening hurricane and the eye was briefly not seen on satellite imagery{10]on julyxc2xa031 douglas became much better organized as it turned more west-northwestward{11] and it attained major hurricane status or a categoryxc2xa03 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale about 205xc2xa0miles (330xc2xa0km) southwest of manzanillo by early on augustxc2xa01 douglas reached peak winds of 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) a categoryxc2xa04 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale later that day the hurricane attained its lowest pressure of 946xc2xa0mbar about 275xc2xa0miles (440xc2xa0km) south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula douglas maintained peak intensity for 36xc2xa0hours{6] until augustxc2xa02 when the eye became less-organized as the overall convection began to weaken{12] weakening continued due to cooler waters as douglas turned to the west and on augustxc2xa03 the hurricane deteriorated to tropical storm status{6] as a tropical storm there was minimal deep convection although the center remained very well-defined{13] on augustxc2xa05 douglas weakened to tropical depression status and by the next day could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone the remnant circulation continued westward for several days{6]preparations{edit]prior to cesar's arrival in venezuela a tropical storm warning was issued for areas west of la vela de coro to the border with colombia; the warning was discontinued later that day{1] the government of colombia issued a tropical storm warning on julyxc2xa025 from the border with venezuela to barranquilla as well as the islands of aruba and curaxc3xa7ao these warnings were discontinued later that day after the storm's passage{1]as cesar approached central america hurricane warnings were posted in nicaragua 31 hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the hurricane with hurricane joan occurring only 8 years prior 10724 people were evacuated before and during the hurricane to take refuge at special camps{14]on julyxc2xa029 shortly after cesar emerged into the pacific ocean and was reclassified tropical depression seven-e the government of mexico issued a tropical storm watch from puerto madero to acapulco{5] about 12xc2xa0hours later after the depression intensified into tropical storm douglas the mexican government canceled the watch and issued a new tropical storm warning from salina cruz to acapulco; this was due to the large extent of tropical storm force winds associated with douglas and its proximity to the south coast of mexico another tropical storm watch was briefly issued on julyxc2xa030 from acapulco to manzanillo{6]impact{edit]impact by

tropical cyclone that dropped heavy rains along its path through the southern caribbean sea and central america damage was moderate to extreme due to mudslides and flooding and at least 113 people were killedlesser antilles and south america{edit]the precursor tropical wave to cesar produced rains and gusty winds through a large portion of the lesser antilles{1] in venezuela heavy rains from the storm triggered flooding and landslides that killed at least five people{22] in the capital city of caracas 45 people were left homeless as a result of the storm{23] although the storm passed directly over the region the abc islands off the coast of colombia and venezuela received little rainfall peaking at 015xc2xa0in (38xc2xa0mm) on curaxc3xa7ao peak gusts were also measured at 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) on the island{1] the winds caused minor damage to roofs and trees across all three islands as well as rough surf that drowned one person in curaxc3xa7ao{18]as a tropical storm cesar struck the northern coastline of colombia bringing heavy rains and gusty winds at least three people were killed in storm related incidents{15] two of which occurred when an avalanche buried a house in pueblo bello in the northern part of the country{24] cesar brought torrential rains to the archipelago of san andrxc3xa9s providencia and santa catalina offshore eastern nicaragua eleven people were killed across the archipelago including eight children who died in a landslide{16] across the islands 60 homes lost their roofs and numerous trees were felled due to high winds the local governor stated that losses from cesar reached 800xc2xa0million cop (44000xc2xa0usd){17]nicaragua{edit]torrential rainfall was the immediate effect of cesar peaking at 107xc2xa0inches (271xc2xa0mm) at bluefields nicaragua with many other locations reporting over 6xc2xa0inches (150xc2xa0mm) the intense precipitation led to widespread mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country the most affected region was lake managua where the water level was approaching dangerous levels{25] the storm wrought extensive damage throughout the country leaving roughly 505xc2xa0million in damage behind large portions of the country's crops were affected resulting in a food shortage following the hurricane according to nicaraguan officials more than 2500 homes 39 bridges and 40xc2xa0km (25xc2xa0mi) of road were destroyed by cesar in all the storm killed 42 people and left an estimated 100000 homeless{26]costa rica{edit]like nicaragua costa rica received heavy rainfall from cesar leading to mudslides and widespread flooding river flooding damaged 51 houses and washed away 213 more; 72 bridges were also destroyed the road network was significantly damaged{27] costa rica requested international aid subsequent to the storm across the country at least 39 people were killed and damage amounted to 151xc2xa0million additionally 29 people were listed as missing{19]el salvador{edit]as cesar continued westward it produced heavy flooding and mudslides in western el salvador killing 9 in the community of josxc3xa9 cecilio del valle four others drowned in other parts of the country{27]mexico{edit]hurricane douglas brought up to 6xc2xa0inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rain on the south coast of mexico and resulted in a 4xc2xa0foot (12xc2xa0m) storm surge but no deaths were reported{28]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesthe name cesar was retired in spring of 1997 and will not be used again in the atlantic basin it was
