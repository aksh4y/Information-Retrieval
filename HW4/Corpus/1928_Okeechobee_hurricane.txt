as the san felipe segundo hurricane was one of the deadliest hurricanes in the recorded history of the north atlantic basin the fourth tropical cyclone third hurricane and only major hurricane of the 1928 season this system developed just offshore the west coast of africa on septemberxc2xa06 initially a tropical depression it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day shortly before passing south of the cape verde islands further intensification was slow and halted by late on septemberxc2xa07 about 48xc2xa0hours later the storm resumed strengthening and became a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the modern-day saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale still moving westward the system reached categoryxc2xa04 intensity before striking guadeloupe on septemberxc2xa012 there the storm brought "great destruction" and 1200xc2xa0deaths the islands of martinique montserrat and nevis also reported damage and fatalities but not nearly as severe as in guadeloupearound midday on septemberxc2xa013 the storm strengthened into a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) about six hours later the system made landfall in puerto rico; it remains the only recorded categoryxc2xa05 to strike the island as of 2017 very strong winds resulted in severe damage in puerto rico throughout the island an estimated 24728xc2xa0homes were destroyed and 192444xc2xa0were damaged leaving over 500000xc2xa0people homeless heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture on puerto rico alone there were 312xc2xa0deaths and about 50 million usd (697 million today) in damage while crossing the island and emerging into the atlantic the storm weakened slightly falling to categoryxc2xa04 intensity the storm began crossing through the bahamas on septemberxc2xa016 where it resulted in 18 fatalitiesearly on septemberxc2xa017 the storm made landfall near west palm beach florida with winds of 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) in the city more than 1711xc2xa0homes were destroyed elsewhere in the county impact was most severe around lake okeechobee the storm surge caused water to pour out of the southern edge of the lake flooding hundreds of square miles as high as 20 feet (61xc2xa0m) above ground numerous houses and buildings were swept away in the cities of belle glade canal point chosen pahokee and south bay at least 2500xc2xa0people drowned while damage was estimated at 25xc2xa0million while crossing florida the system weakened significantly falling to categoryxc2xa01 intensity late on septemberxc2xa017 it curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged into the atlantic on septemberxc2xa018 but soon made another landfall near edisto island south carolina with winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) early on the following day the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over north carolina hours later overall the system caused 100xc2xa0million in damage and at least

of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon septemberxc2xa06 ships reported a tropical depression developing just off the west coast of africa near dakar senegal the next day a ship reported winds of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) or tropical storm status; on this basis the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on septemberxc2xa06 however lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the atlantic ocean{1] on septemberxc2xa010 the ss commack first observed the storm about 900xc2xa0miles (1450xc2xa0km) to the east of guadeloupe which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio later that day two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm{2] and the hurricane research division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00xc2xa0utc on

18:30xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa012 the hurricane's eye moved over guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of 940 millibars (28xc2xa0inhg) suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240xc2xa0kmh (140xc2xa0mph) or category 4 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale{1] continuing to the west-northwest the hurricane passed about 10xc2xa0mi (16xc2xa0km) south of saint croix before approaching puerto rico on septemberxc2xa013 the 15xc2xa0mi (25xc2xa0km) eye crossed puerto rico in eight hours from the southeast to the northwest moving ashore near guayama and exiting between aguadilla and isabela{5] a ship near the southern coast reported a pressure of 931xc2xa0mbar (275xc2xa0inhg) and the cup anemometer at san juan reported sustained winds of 160xc2xa0mph (257xc2xa0kmh) before failing{1] as the wind station was 30xc2xa0miles (50xc2xa0km) north of the storm's center winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 200xc2xa0mph (320xc2xa0kmh){2] on this basis the hurricane is believed to have made landfall in puerto rico as a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale although there was uncertainty in the peak intensity due to the large size and slow movement of the storm{1]after emerging from puerto rico the hurricane had weakened to winds of about 140xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) based on a pressure reading of 941xc2xa0mbar (278xc2xa0inhg) at isabela the storm brushed the northern coast of hispaniola while moving west-northwestward gradually restrengthening on septemberxc2xa015 it passed within 35xc2xa0mi (55xc2xa0km) of grand turk by which time the winds increased to 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) the storm continued through the bahamas as a strong category 4 hurricane passing near nassau at 10:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa016{1] initially richard gray of the us weather bureau was optimistic that the storm would spare south florida{6] however at 00:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa017 the large hurricane made landfall in southeastern florida near west palm beach with estimated winds of 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) this was based on a pressure reading of 929xc2xa0mbar (274xc2xa0inhg) in the city{1] which at the time was the lowest pressure reading in the mainland united states; this broke the previous record of 935xc2xa0mbar (276xc2xa0inhg) set during the 1926 miami hurricane peak gusts were estimated near 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) at canal point{2]the hurricane quickly weakened as it progressed inland and moved over lake okeechobee although the large size allowed it to maintain hurricane status for several more days late on septemberxc2xa017 the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near jacksonville early the next day with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) at 08:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa018 the storm once again reached open waters later that day the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters making a second united states landfall near edisto island south carolina at 19:00xc2xa0utc with winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) accelerating northeastward the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over north carolina on septemberxc2xa019 the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status the cyclone turned to the north-northwest moving quickly through the eastern united states{1] on septemberxc2xa021 the former hurricane dissipated over ontario{1] having merged with another disturbance{2]impact{edit]leeward islands{edit]storm deaths by regionregiondeathslocaledeathscaribbeanand

winds were clocked at 24xc2xa0mph (39xc2xa0kmh); there were no reports of damage{2] though one fatality occurred{7] in martinique even further south of the storm's path there were three fatalities guadeloupe received a direct hit from the storm apparently with little warning; the death toll there was 1200{10] and damage reports relayed through paris indicated "great destruction" on the island{2] about three-fourths of the island's residents were left homeless in the community of saint-franxc3xa7ois the only structure to remain standing was the police station which was built with reinforced concrete to the east of the town the merchant ship albatros carrying 80xc2xa0casks of rum sank the crew and the five men attempting to save the ship drowned{7] approximately 85xe2x80x9395 of banana crops were destroyed 70xe2x80x9380 of tree crops suffered severe damage and 40 of the sugar cane crop was ruined{11]montserrat just north of the storm's center was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered xc2xa3150000 (1928 ukp) in damages and 42 deaths; plymouth and salem were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive{8] all commercial and government buildings on the island were destroyed as were more than 600xc2xa0homes saint kitts and nevis also suffered heavily on the island of st kitts a number of homes built on wooden foundations were demolished nine deaths were reported six of which occurred as a result of a schoolhouse collapse thirteen people were killed on the island of nevis{7]the storm destroyed hundreds of home on antigua including a doctor's home and a "poor house" government offices hospitals and school were also damaged on saint croix nearly all of the island's 11000xc2xa0residents suffered some degree of loss a total of 143xc2xa0buildings were destroyed including a sugar mill the storm left nine deaths on the island throughout the virgin islands as many as 700000xc2xa0people were rendered homeless{7]puerto rico{edit]hurricane-force winds drove this 10-foot (3xc2xa0m) piece of 2x4 lumber through a palm tree in puerto ricowhile the storm was passing near dominica the san juan puerto rico weather bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two the advisory was sent via telegraph to 75xc2xa0police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours;{12] this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio{5] warnings were also posted for 12xc2xa0ports along the southern coast causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of puerto rico by comparison the weaker 1899 san ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3000xc2xa0people{12]according to the san juan national weather service office the storm was "up to this time the greatest and more  {sic] intense and destructive hurricane of record in puerto rico"{5] along the storm path the eye passed over guayama cayey and aibonito resulting in a period of calm lasting 20xc2xa0minutes{12] the island of puerto rico received the worst of the storm's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at category 5 strength{12] the hurricane was extremely large as it crossed puerto rico hurricane-force winds were measured in guayama for 18xc2xa0hours; since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13xc2xa0mph (21xc2xa0kmh) the diameter of the storm's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234xc2xa0miles (376xc2xa0km){12]the storm was named the san felipe ii hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the christian feast day of saint philip{13] it was named "segundo" spanish for "the second" because of another destructive "san felipe hurricane" which struck puerto rico on that same day in 1876 since european arrival in the americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit puerto rico in 1953 the united states started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints{13]the rainfall recorded on september 13xe2x80x9314 1928 remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in puerto rico within a period of forty-eight hours in those regions where precipitation is more common place as in adjuntas in the cordillera central and in the sierra de luquillo the rain was over 25 inches (640xc2xa0mm) with 2960 inches (752xc2xa0mm) recorded in adjuntas the anemometer located in puerta de tierra lost one of its cups at 11:44xc2xa0am on september 13 just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) per hourxe2x80x94a speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles (260xc2xa0km) per hour for one minute because these measurements were taken 30 miles (48xc2xa0km) from san felipe's eye at the time it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles (320xc2xa0km) per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawn{13]there was general destruction through the island with the towns where the eye passed being swept away{13] property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic the northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of categoryxc2xa03 strength with hurricane-force winds lasting as long as 18xc2xa0hours official reports stated "several hundred thousand" people were left homeless and property damages were estimated at 50xc2xa0million{12]{14]on the island there was no building that was not affected some sugar mills ("centrales") that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble reports say that 24728 homes were destroyed and 192444 were partially destroyed{13] most of the sugarcane fields were flooded ruining the year's crops half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed; almost all of the coffee harvest was lost the coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow the tobacco farms also had great losses after this hurricane puerto rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter{15]communications were impacted by fallen trees landslides and damaged bridges of the school buildings 770xc2xa0were destroyed or damaged according to some estimates of the day excluding personal losses the damages reached 85312xc2xa0million and over 500000xc2xa0people were left homeless san felipe ii is officially classified as puerto rico's biggest worst and most devastating hurricane to ever have impacted the island{13]greater antilles and bahamas{edit]deadliest atlantic hurricanesrankhurricaneseasonfatalities1"great

hurricane passed just north of the dominican republic producing very little damage this was due to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center advance warning reduced the number of ships traversing the region{2]while the hurricane was passing nearby grand turk reported winds of 120xc2xa0mph (193xc2xa0kmh) according to a ship report in the region "the force of the windxc2xa0 could only be judged by the noise made by the storm which reminded me of the new york subway going full speed passing switches" winds approached 120xc2xa0mph (193xc2xa0kmh) at nassau before the anemometer failed{1] in addition to the winds the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region totaling 9xc2xa0in (228xc2xa0mm) in nassau{2] as in puerto rico authorities in the bahamas had ample warning of the hurricane's approach and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in grand turk although the crews were saved a sloop traversing from ambergris caye to grand turk was lost killing all 18xc2xa0people on board{2] the storm caused heavy damage throughout the bahamas mostly to property and crops{1]in nassau some buildings which were recently repaired after the 1926 nassau hurricane were destroyed during this storm a 10-year-old girl drowned after falling into an open trench filled with water at the fort montague hotel the windows doors and furniture were badly damaged similar impact was reported at the royal victoria hotel while the british colonial hotel was largely spared however the gardens of the three hotels were "damaged almost beyond recognition"{7]on bimini sustained winds of 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) were observed causing major damage to buildings ninety-five houses and some other buildings including a few churches and government buildings were damaged or destroyed on eleuthera minor damage was reported on rum cay most of the food crops were destroyed on san salvador island four buildings were demolished including two churches while several other structures suffered minor damage food crops were nearly wiped out{7]florida{edit]damage from the hurricanemain article: effects of the 1928 okeechobee hurricane in floridawhile the hurricane was moving through the bahamas the weather bureau issued storm warnings from miami to titusville later upgrading to a hurricane warning from miami to daytona beach the agency advised residents to take precautions for the hurricane citing the potential for strong winds and waves hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from punta rassa to apalachicola and after the storm recurved hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to jacksonville{2] because of well-issued hurricane warnings residents were prepared for the storm and the number of lives lost in the coastal palm beach area was only 26{2]strong winds struck southern florida as the hurricane moved ashore with three unofficial reports of 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh){2] in miami to the south of the center winds reached 78xc2xa0mph (126xc2xa0kmh){1] and farther south key west reported winds of only 39xc2xa0mph (63xc2xa0kmh) the eye at landfall was 25xc2xa0mi (40xc2xa0km) wide and after moving inland crossed lake okeechobee where a calm was reported for 30xc2xa0minutes winds at canal point adjacent to the lake were estimated as high as 160xc2xa0mph (255xc2xa0kmh); the anemometer blew away after reporting sustained winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) the pressure at canal point dropped to 942xc2xa0mbar (2782xc2xa0inhg) the lowest pressure north of lake okeechobee was 966xc2xa0mbar (2854xc2xa0inhg) in bartow and along the west coast winds reached 31xc2xa0mph (50xc2xa0kmh) in tampa{2]the hurricane left thousands of people homeless in florida; property damage was estimated at 25xc2xa0million (349xc2xa0million) it is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003 it would cause 187xc2xa0billion in damages the cyclone remains one of three atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of florida with a central pressure below 940xc2xa0mbar (2776xc2xa0inhg) the others being the 1926 miami hurricane and hurricane andrew of 1992{16]in addition to the human fatalities 1278xc2xa0livestock and 47389 poultry were killed respectively{17] agriculture was impacted significantly with the storm destroying what may have been the largest "citrus crop in the history of the industry" approximately 6 of oranges and 18 of grapefruit were ruined respectively harvesting the remaining crops was delayed until mid-october due to inundated groves{7] communications also suffered severely throughout the state 32000xc2xa0households were left without telephone service and 400xc2xa0poles were broken and about 2500xc2xa0others leaning{7] then-governor of florida john w martin estimated that 15000xc2xa0families were left homeless in palm beach county alone additionally about 11500xc2xa0families would need to be "re-established"{18]coastal south florida{edit]approximate area of the flood note: the palm beach county label is misplaced north of canal point has been in martin county since 1925in miami damage was minimal limited to broken windows and awnings in hollywood and fort lauderdale windows and roofs were damaged although damage was still fairly minor{2] numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed in the latter{19] northward from pompano beach to jupiter buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10xc2xa0ft (3xc2xa0m) storm surge{2] nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in deerfield beach while several citizens estimated that at least 50 of homes were demolished the town's post office depot and an entire business block were also destroyed an eight-year-old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge in boca raton two garages and several houses were destroyed at the cloister inn windows were shattered and the roof was damaged; across the street 32xc2xa0freight cars belonging to a train along the florida east coast railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch a short distance to the north a warehouse was flattened a building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened in delray beach four churches suffered severe damage and the alta repp and seacrest hotels both lost a portion of their roof the police reported three deaths within the city in delray beach and lantana all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged in boynton beach about 75 of businesses suffered complete destruction fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school{20]aftermath of the hurricane in southern floridain lake worth approximately 50 of homes were damaged or destroyed while 75 of buildings in the business district suffered damage{20] impact along the coast was most severe in palm beach total coastal damages were estimated as "several million" dollars{2] in west palm beach the storm destroyed 1711xc2xa0homes and damaged 6369xc2xa0others and demolished 268xc2xa0businesses and impacted 490xc2xa0other businesses; the city suffered the worst damage totaling just under 138xc2xa0million{18] likewise there was also severe wind damage in palm beach a few buildings constructed by henry flagler such as the breakers the royal poinciana hotel and whitehall were damaged mar-a-lago suffered little impact other than uprooted trees and the destruction of a large roman-style window according to marjorie merriweather post rodman wanamaker's house known as "la guerida" and later the "winter white house" during the presidency of john f kennedy suffered heavy damage during the storm{18] the alba billows new palm beach and royal daneli hotels all suffered water damage while the alba hotel was also deroofed nearby the rainbow pier only received structural damage to its railings though the pier office was blown away{21] approximately 600xc2xa0structures including 10 hotels were damaged in palm beach damage totaled over 2xc2xa0million{18]the strongest winds in the eyewall affected northern palm beach county particularly the vicinity of jupiter as the eye made landfall farther south{22] at the jupiter inlet lighthouse the mortar was reportedly "squeezedxc2xa0 like toothpaste" between the bricks during the storm swaying the tower 17xc2xa0in (430xc2xa0mm) off the base{23] the lighthouse keeper captain seabrook and his son franklin worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out after the generator failed to work they hand-cranked the light's mantle{24] the building formerly used as a weather bureau office was destroyed nearby six people died after a house was demolished six other fatalities occurred west of jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsed{7]lake okeechobee and everglades{edit]inland the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of lake okeechobee residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule many thought it had missed and returned to their homes in the weeks prior to storm heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) between augustxc2xa010 and septemberxc2xa010 and filled nearby canals and ditches precipitation from the hurricane itself caused lake okeechobee to rise further{23] when the worst of the storm crossed the lake the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake the resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20xc2xa0ft (6xc2xa0m) deep houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered{25] most survivors and bodies were washed out into the everglades where many of the bodies were never found{26] agricultural losses in the area surrounding lake okeechobee were also significant with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150xc2xa0tractors suffering damage{7]storm total precipitation for septemberxc2xa015xe2x80x9319 1928as the rear eyewall passed over the area the flood reversed itself breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing similar but smaller flooding{26] route 98 then known as conner's highway was closed until january when the bridge across the onosohatchee river at taylor creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about 150xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) upstream during the storm{27] in okeechobee county homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge while dwellings within the city of okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) however brick and concrete-structured dwellings received little damage a number of three-story business buildings collapsed during the storm{28] almost all roads were left impassable while communications were nearly wiped out{29] overall 27xc2xa0deaths occurred in okeechobee county along the southwestern shore of lake okeechobee the towns of clewiston and moore haven were both flooded but much of the damage to houses was due to strong winds{28]on kreamer island many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate in some homes 20xe2x80x9330xc2xa0people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile (08xc2xa0km) away despite this only one person drowned on the island residents of torry island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm they attempted to evacuate but the causeway was already inundated forcing twenty-three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse floodwaters entered the building forcing the occupants into the rafters however the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal ten people drowned but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood or the barge a teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the everglades experiment station in belle glade xe2x80x93 a distance of about 8xc2xa0mi (13xc2xa0km){23] on ritta island a number who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses were struck by trees or received fatal bites from water moccasin{30]in south bay nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed at least 160xc2xa0fatalities occurred in the city{18] the future first mayor of south bay aubrey (aka "orb" or "ao") walker along with his brother haughty d walker (aka "haught") survived the great hurricane of 1928 by gathering family members and joining a number of other south bay citizens on a barge in the canal which allowed them to survive the flood waters that swept over south bay and ultimately engulfed okeelanta {31] throughout the 1920s okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires finally the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned{32] bean city was also destroyed during the hurricane but it was eventually rebuilt by arthur wells{33] sebring farms was reduced to piles of rubber with only four tall royal palm trees left standing{7] only the hotel at miami locks survived the storm{7] ninety-nine people died in that town{7] in chosen only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people twenty other residents took refuge in a building which lost its roof during the storm forcing the occupants to move into the restroom a house that was full of people floated about half a mile (08xc2xa0km) from its original location the refugees were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment{23]burial of victims in west palm beachfloodwaters persisted for several weeks greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation burial services were quickly overwhelmed and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves around 75 of the fatalities were migrant farm workers making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this the count of the dead is not very accurate the red cross estimated the number of fatalities as 1836 which was taken as the official count by the national weather service for many years (and exactly equal to the official count for hurricane katrina) older sources usually list 3411 as the hurricane's total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the us death count was revised to "at least" 2500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the 1900 galveston hurricane a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of port mayaca contains the bodies of 1600 victims of the hurricane{26]central and north florida{edit]in fort myers property damage was slight limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront{34] nearly all cigar factories in tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings{35] offshore the fishing smack wallace a mcdonnell was beached near piney point though all of the crew survived additionally the cuban schooner isabel alvado sank offshore boca grande the crew who were immigrants were rescued by the coast guard and later deported{36] in martin county a bridge connecting stuart and palm city was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result a temporary ferry service across the st lucie river was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929{37] in fort pierce most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas a warehouse fish houses docks and a bridge across the indian river were destroyed while several other buildings were unroofed damage in the city totaled about 150000{18]in the interior areas of central and north florida impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses particularly citrus though wind damage occurred to structures between sebring and lake wales 200xc2xa0telephone poles were toppled in bartow business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage winds gusting up to 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) lashed lakeland many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted including the hospital and a number of businesses at florida southern college (fsc) the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a lesser degree the trees in the citrus grove surrounding fsc lost much of their fruit overall lakeland suffered about 50000 in damage{38] in orlando impact to properties was described as slight{34] winds up to 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) impacted the jacksonville area resulting in minor damage at jacksonville beach{39]elsewhere{edit]outside of florida damage in the united states was minor from the hurricane{2] in georgia low-lying streets were flooded or washed out in the savannah area additionally winds downed trees and power lines{1] heavy rainfall occurred from eastern florida through coastal georgia the carolinas and southeast virginia the highest rainfall total was 1253 inches (318xc2xa0mm) at darlington south carolina{40] the storm caused flooding in north carolina and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7xc2xa0foot (21xc2xa0m) storm surge to the norfolk area{41] after the hurricane became extratropical its wind field became very large atlantic city new jersey recorded winds of 76xc2xa0mph (122xc2xa0kmh) despite being far from the

train leaving miami carried 20xc2xa0doctors and 20xc2xa0nurses to west palm beach{43] the miami red cross citizens relief committee which was established to provide aid for victims of the storm transported "hundreds of loaves of bread gallons of milk pounds of coffee and sugar blankets cots and medical supplies" the first relief train was ridden by us senator joseph t robinson the democratic vice presidential nominee during the election that year at least 100xc2xa0people were brought to miami for medical treatment in lake worth 25xc2xa0people were treated for various injuries at the gulf stream hotel and the local fire station dr w a claxton chief of the miami department of public welfare requested antitoxin typhoid serum and at least 200xc2xa0tetanus serums there was also a request for 1000xc2xa0more cots in west palm beach and kelsey city{44]racial issues{edit]further information: hurricane of 1928 african american mass burial sitehistorical marker at the mass grave in west palm beachin florida although the hurricane's destruction affected everything in its path the death toll was by far highest and the aftermath the worst in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around lake okeechobee such as belle glade chosen pahokee south bay and bean city{45] around 75 of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers most of whom were blackthe black workers did most of the post-hurricane cleanup work and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites{46] additionally the white victims received a proper burial at woodlawn cemetery in downtown west palm beach{45] which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial{46]in contrast the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such as the ones in west palm beach and port mayacathe historical marker added to the memorial site in 2003 the seventy-fifth anniversary of the stormrobert hazard a resident of west palm beach established the storm of '28 memorial park coalition inc to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm in 2000 the west palm beach burial site was reacquired by the city of west palm beach and plans for construction of a memorial began the site was listed on the us national register of historic places in 2002 and a state historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane{45]the effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers were dramatized in african-american writer zora neale hurston's 1937 seminal novel their eyes were watching god her best known work and a selection on time magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best english-language novels published since 1923{47]{48]improved building codes{edit]in the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal florida it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings buildings with well-constructed frames and those made of steel concrete brick or stone were largely immune to winds and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings coming on the heels of the 1926 miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes{49]flood control{edit]a sign advertising the completion of the hoover diketo prevent a recurrence of disasters like this one and the great miami hurricane of 1926 the florida state legislature created the okeechobee flood control district which was authorized to cooperate with the us army corps of engineers in flood control undertakings{50] after a personal inspection of the area by president herbert hoover the corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels control gates and major levees along lake okeechobee's shores a long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control water conservation prevention of saltwater intrusion and preservation of fish and wildlife populations{50] one of the solutions was the construction of the herbert hoover dike today concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with "piping" and erosion leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike with the first stage costing approximately 67xc2xa0million (us){51]see also{edit]puerto rico portaltropical cyclones
