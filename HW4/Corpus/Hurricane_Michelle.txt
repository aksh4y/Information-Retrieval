2001 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane michelle was the fifth costliest tropical cyclone in cuban history and strongest of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season the thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western caribbean sea on octoberxc2xa029; the wave had initially moved off the coast of africa 13xc2xa0days prior in its early developmental stages the depression meandered over nicaragua later paralleling the mosquito coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on novemberxc2xa01; michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day shortly after rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions with the storm's central barometric pressure dropping 51xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 151xc2xa0inhg) in 29xc2xa0hours after a slight fluctuation in strength michelle reached its peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane with winds of 140xc2xa0mph (225xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 933xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2755xc2xa0inhg){nb 1] at roughly the same time the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward; this brought the intense hurricane to a cuban landfall within the bay of pigs later that day crossing over the island michelle was weakened significantly and was only a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane upon reentry into the atlantic ocean the hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the bahamas on novemberxc2xa05 before being absorbed by a cold front the following dayhurricane michelle caused widespread devastation across the western caribbean during its eight-day trek as a tropical wave torrential rainfall occurred across jamaica causing mudslides and killing two people damage in the island country was estimated at 18xc2xa0million{nb 2] when the storm drifted over areas of central america early in its existence heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure affecting areas affected by hurricane mitch roughly three years prior in honduras and nicaragua 14xc2xa0people were killed with an additional 62xc2xa0people unaccounted for in the cayman islands areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding particularly in grand cayman where damage was totaled 28xc2xa0millionthe majority of damage caused by michelle occurred in cuba where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over 49xc2xa0years strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country high winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop at the time michelle was the costliest hurricane in cuban history with an estimated 18xc2xa0billion in damage; this figure was greatly surpassed by hurricane ike nearly seven years later as a weakening system michelle moved past florida and the bahamas strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property throughout the entirety of michelle's track 22xc2xa0people were killed and damage was estimated at roughly 2xc2xa0billion (2001 usd; 271xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) after the season the name michelle was retired and was replaced with melissa for the 2007 atlantic hurricane

references8 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon octoberxc2xa016 2001 a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of africa and moved into the atlantic ocean at the time the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity on octoberxc2xa023 the disturbance crossed the lesser antilles before moving into the caribbean sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development three days later the wave moved into the western caribbean spawning a broad low-pressure area off the coast of nicaragua at 1800xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa029{1] a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression 40xc2xa0mi (60xc2xa0km) south-southwest of puerto cabezas nicaragua{2] at the time convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern; as such initial forecasts predicted for the depression designated as tropical depression fifteen to slowly move generally northward{3] later that day a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression indicating an increase in organization{4] the disturbance meandered over eastern nicaragua for 36xc2xa0hours before emerging into the caribbean sea near cabo gracias a dios by 2100xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa031{1]{5] upon emerging into the caribbean sea the depression quickly organized and the national hurricane centerxc2xa0(nhc) upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at 0000xc2xa0utc the following day based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior as such the tropical storm was designated with the name michelle{6]{7]gradual strengthening occurred throughout novemberxc2xa01 as michelle's cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward signifying strengthening at the time the nhc predicted that there was a roughly 12xc2xa0percent chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify; by that time the storm had met three of the organization's five criterion for rapid intensification{8] during the day fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone but there was a general strengthening trend{9] two dropsondes deployed within the system early on novemberxc2xa02 observed hurricane-force winds within michelle; based on this data the nhc upgraded michelle to hurricane intensity at 1200xc2xa0utc that day{7] while the storm was situated 290xc2xa0mi (460xc2xa0km) south-southeast of the guanahacabibes peninsula{10]hurricane michelle undergoing extratropical transition over the bahamas on novemberxc2xa05a period of rapid intensification began shortly after as michelle's satellite presentation improved with the cyclone's minimum barometric pressure falling 51xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 151xc2xa0inhg) in 29xc2xa0hours{1] at 0000xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa03 the hurricane attained categoryxc2xa02 hurricane intensity at roughly the same time the hurricane's eye became more apparent on satellite imagery{11] by 1200xc2xa0utc later that day michelle had intensified to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{7] six hours later the hurricane weakened to categoryxc2xa03 intensity but reached its minimum barometric pressure of 934xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2758xc2xa0inhg) afterwards michelle's central pressure began to rise; despite the trend its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward{7] despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on novemberxc2xa04{12] michelle attained winds of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) by 0600xc2xa0utc that day; these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence{7]at 1800xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa04 michelle made landfall on cayo largo del sur as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane with winds of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh); this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the bay of pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm when michelle made landfall on the cuban mainland it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in cuban history since the landfall of hurricane fox in 1952 at the time the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure was 950xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2806xc2xa0inhg) over cuba michelle's center of circulation was significantly disrupted and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity;{1] by the time it had emerged into the atlantic ocean on novemberxc2xa05 winds were only estimated at 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh){7] southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development and as such michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone{13] that day the weakening hurricane made landfalls over andros island and eleuthera island before becoming fully extratropical by 0000xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa06 while still maintaining hurricane-force winds the extratropical system persisted for roughly 18xc2xa0more hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front{1]preparations{edit]cuba{edit]warnings and watches associated with hurricane michelle as it made landfall on cuba on novemberxc2xa04as hurricane michelle approached the cuban coast the government of cuba issued a hurricane watch for the western cuban provinces of pinar del rxc3xado la habana matanzas and isla de la juventud at 2100xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa01{14] the following day the same hurricane watch was extended eastward to include all provinces from pinar del rxc3xado to ciego de xc3x81vila;{1]{15] all hurricane watches in cuba were upgraded to hurricane warnings at 1100xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa03{16] all warnings in cuba were discontinued once michelle began to accelerate out to sea at 1200xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa05{1]prior to reaching the coast michelle was expected to be the strongest cuban tropical cyclone in at least 75xc2xa0years the cuban red cross deployed 24500xc2xa0volunteers across cuba to assist civil defense teams in evacuation procedures for potentially affected populations by novemberxc2xa04 an estimated 590000xc2xa0people were evacuated across the country including 80xc2xa0percent of the population of the province of pinar del rxc3xado{17] in havana authorities evacuated 150000xc2xa0people coastal tourist resorts were cleared and 35500xc2xa0students were evacuated out of camps hosted on the zapata peninsula{18] on cuba's southwestern islands including cayo largo and isla de la juventud 500xc2xa0tourists were evacuated the entire population of surgidero de batabanxc3xb3 was evacuated{19] in addition to the evacuations the government sent food water and medicine supplies to areas south of the capital all domestic and international flights to and from the country were cancelled{18]elsewhere{edit]at 1700xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa01 a tropical storm watch was issued for grand cayman island{1]{15] three hours prior the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning in conjunction with a hurricane watch for areas of the florida keys from ocean reef florida to the dry tortugas{16] at 0300xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa04 a hurricane watch was issued for areas of the northwestern and central bahamas at the same time a new tropical storm warning was issued for the east coast of florida between jupiter inlet and ocean reef and for the state's western coast south of bonita beach at 0600xc2xa0utc the tropical storm watch for grand cayman was upgraded and extended to include the entirety of the cayman islands six hours later the hurricane watch for the florida keys was upgraded to warning status early the next day a hurricane watch was issued for bermuda after michelle made its final cuban landfall meanwhile the tropical storm warning issued for the cayman islands was discontinued as michelle accelerated away from landmasses warnings and watches were discontinued all tropical cyclone warnings in the united states were discontinued by 2100xc2xa0utc that day at the same time however the hurricane watch for bermuda was changed to a tropical storm warning; this warning was sustained for a day before being discontinued shortly after all warnings in the bahamas were also discontinued{1]impact{edit]deaths and damage by regionregiontotaldeathsmissingdamage(usd)sourcexc2xa0bahamas007008300000000000000xe2x99xa0300xc2xa0millionxc2xa0cayman

of differing sources totals may not matchhurricane michelle brought torrential rains along its path through the western caribbean sea killing 22 people and causing extensive damage in central america and cubajamaica{edit]as the precursor tropical wave to michelle drifted through the western caribbean sea it produced torrential rainfall on the island of jamaica causing widespread flooding{1] several residences on annotto bay and port maria were flooded as a result 163xc2xa0evacuees sought shelter in locations in annotto bay in portland a shelter was opened for effected populations;{21] in the same parish six homes were swept away from their foundations{22] in the parishes of saint catherine saint andrew and saint ann several roads were blocked by debris the jamaican national works agencyxc2xa0(nwa) worked to clear the road debris{21] the blocked roads isolated seven jamaican villages for an extended period of time{23]after tropical cyclogenesis michelle passed to the northwest of jamaica producing additional rainfall in a 48-hour period beginning on octoberxc2xa029 a location measured 4165 inches (1058xc2xa0mm) denoting an average rainfall rate of 086 inches (22xc2xa0mm) per hour{24] many other locations reported high rainfall totals over a ten-day period throughout michelle's passage near jamaica{1] near spur tree hill an oil spill resulted from the flooding roads that were previously cleaned of debris a few days prior were covered again by the additional rainfall the rains also disrupted the country's communication and electrical grid leaving 6000xc2xa0homes without power in affected regions the widespread power outages in conjunction with invasive floodwaters also caused the cessation of 31xc2xa0water plants run by the national water commission overall 30xc2xa0homes were destroyed by flooding caused by michelle as it passed to the northwest extensive damage was reported to small livestock bananas plantains vegetables and coffee{25] coffee crops were severely affected in portland and saint andrew parishes with losses calculated at j1026xc2xa0million (us22xc2xa0million) roughly 400xc2xa0ac (200xc2xa0ha) of banana plantations were damaged over four parishes amounting to j182xc2xa0million (us400000) in damage the plantain crop mostly grown for domestic usage suffered extensive damage valued at j22xc2xa0million (us480000) losses sustained to livestock were estimated at j308xc2xa0million (us670000){26]overall floods caused widespread damage throughout jamaica the watersheds of the spanish and swift rivers were the worst affected areas near the coast the rivers began to overflow due to excess floodwater eroding beach roads and three major highways in portland parish the rains caused numerous landslides in the community of bybrook alone it was estimated that roughly 7000000xc2xa0ft3 (200000xc2xa0m3) of material was deposited in the village an assessment of the damage concluded that 500xc2xa0homes were destroyed beyond repair while an additional 561xc2xa0homes were at least damaged by the floods and heavy rain while one school was damaged solely by the floods six other schools were damaged due to their use as shelters{26] damage on jamaica due to michelle totaled 18xc2xa0million{27] of which 118xc2xa0million was due to crop and livestock losses damage to bridges alone totaled j1437xc2xa0million (us31xc2xa0million) five fatalities were also confirmed{26] and 340xc2xa0people were displaced from their homes{27]central america{edit]tropical depression fifteen affecting central america on octoberxc2xa030in its early developmental stages as a tropical depression michelle drifted over areas of central america for roughly 36xc2xa0hours dropping torrential rainfall and causing widespread flooding in areas affected by hurricane mitch almost exactly three years prior the hardest hit region was gracias a dios department in northeastern honduras where at one point 100xc2xa0villages were isolated by the floods the torrential rainfall caused the displacement of at least 100000xc2xa0people from their residences{1] across central america over 27300xc2xa0people were evacuated from flooded areas{28]in honduras the floods damaged 245xc2xa0homes resulting in the displacement of 4393xc2xa0people across the country six bridges sustained at least partial damage of which three were destroyed as a result of the damage the government of honduras declared a state of emergency for five departmentsxc2xa0xe2x80x93 colxc3xb3n atlxc3xa1ntida yoro cortxc3xa9s and santa bxc3xa1rbara{29] the floods caused by michelle were further exacerbated by a cold front which lingered over the region dropping additional rainfall{28] of the affected departments yoro was the most affected with no supply of drinkable water and electricity following the flooding{30] near yoro a bridge crossing the cuyamapa river collapsed due to the floodwaters{31] despite the heavy rainfall areas of honduras suffering from a prolonged drought did not receive beneficial rainfall{32] overall the floods in honduras killed 21xc2xa0people and caused 5xc2xa0million in damage{33] thirty-five of the country's water systems were destroyed the rains also caused the loss of 70xc2xa0percent of bean crops{34]although the precursor to michelle remained stationary primarily over nicaragua damage was not as significant as in honduras due to the storm's displacement of convection to the north{1] nonetheless floods still isolated villages and other communities in the nicaraguan districts of bonaza rosita siuna puerto cabezas waspam and to a lesser extent prinzapolka in those areas roads and bridges were damaged and in some cases destroyed the heavy rains also damaged crops{30] due to the rains an estimated 6000xc2xa0people evacuated from their homes the port city of puerto cabezas was partially flooded{35] as a result of michelle a total of 16xc2xa0deaths were confirmed and damage in the country was estimated at 1xc2xa0million{33] in costa rica michelle caused anomalously high rainfall resulting in flooding{36] overall damage in costa rica totaled 1xc2xa0million though no deaths were reported{33]cayman islands{edit]in early november hurricane michelle brought heavy surf storm surge and flooding to the cayman islands of the islands in the archipelago grand cayman experienced the worst effects from michelle particularly along the island's west coast rainfall peaked at 652xc2xa0in (166xc2xa0mm) in grand cayman; the same station recorded a peak wind gust of 44xc2xa0mph (70xc2xa0kmh){1] the rains caused localized flooding in the western and southern portions of the island{37] another weather station in cayman brac observed a peak wind gust of 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh){1] overall damage from the cayman islands totaled 60xc2xa0million{33]costliest cuban

cuba about 750000 people and 741000 animals were evacuated prior to the hurricane's arrival{44] hurricane michelle quickly crossed the island as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane the strongest since 1952's hurricane fox to the south of cuba cayo largo del sur received a 9xe2x80x9310xc2xa0foot storm surge inundating the entire island with water closer to cuba the isle of youth experienced 1183 inches (300xc2xa0mm) of rain with 15-foot (46xc2xa0m) waves causing extensive power outages and flooding{1]on the coast of western and southern cuba michelle produced 4xe2x80x935xc2xa0foot waves along with a heavy storm surge rainfall amounts up to 754xc2xa0mm2969xc2xa0inches were recorded across the island{42] in addition 300xc2xa0mm1183xc2xa0inches was reported at punta del este the provinces of matanzas villa clara and cienfuegos were hardest hit where 10000 homes were destroyed and another 100000 damaged severe damage was also reported to the sugar cane{1] and in the tourist town of varadero in havana winds and rain destroyed 23 buildings with many others damaged due to well-executed warnings and evacuations only 5 people were killed in cuba{44] the categoryxc2xa04 hurricane

topped the seawall damaging it and nearby structures leaving 20000 in damages the cost to restore the beaches was estimated at 10xc2xa0million{54] the highest winds in relation to the storm were recorded in sombrero key; sustained winds reached 49xc2xa0mph (79xc2xa0kmh) and gusts reached 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh){55] a storm surge of 1 to 2xc2xa0ft (030 to 061xc2xa0m) was recorded along the southeast coastline of florida damages from the hurricane amounted to 50000{56]two tornadoes touched down in the state within the outer bands of the hurricane{56] the first formed as a waterspout and moved onshore near bill baggs beach and destroyed two chikee huts costing 6000 warranting f0 intensity before dissipating{57] the second and stronger of the two tornadoes rated f1 tracked for 2xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) in palm beach county windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings trees and signs were downed and a small area of sugar cane was leveled by the tornado damages from the tornado amounted to 10000{58] a noaa wp-3d orion hurricane hunter aircraft was damaged during a mission into the storm{1]bahamas{edit]because hurricane michelle was weakened and moving rapidly as it moved through the bahamas no deaths or damage were reported the hurricane still retained some of its strength and caused 1264 inches (321xc2xa0mm) of rain in nassau while new providence received a storm surge of 5xe2x80x938xc2xa0feet{1] flooding was reported throughout the archipelago and high winds downed numerous trees resulting in 200000 power outages a few homes sustained roof damage and the roof a shopping center in nassau was blown into a nearby funeral home{59] the radio tower of the station more fm was snapped in half by high winds resulting in a severe disruption of radio broadcasts{60]aftermath{edit]ships carrying tons of frozen chicken legs and corn arrived in havana's harbor on december 16 to aid in the recovery of cuba from hurricane michelle the shipments are part of a one-time 30xc2xa0million purchase of us food by the cuban government to assist in the country's present food shortage{61]the cuban government refused an initial us offer of humanitarian assistance but accepted a proposal to purchase the goods instead although the united states has maintained an economic embargo on cuba for decades us law does allow shipments of food and medicine to the communist-controlled island but until now the cuban government has refused to buy american food because of the restrictions including a ban on direct us financing of food sales{61]other aid from the international community is helping cuba survive michelle's aftermath cuba was promised 600000 in aid from chinese leader li peng who was visiting when the hurricane struck venezuela also sent humanitarian assistance{61]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of its effects the name michelle was retired in the spring of 2002 and will never again be used for
