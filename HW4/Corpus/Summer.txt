astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice the time of maximal insolation or on the traditional date of june 21 a variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological center of the season which is based on average temperature patterns occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation{3] the meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of june july and august in the northern hemisphere and the months of december january and february in the southern hemisphere{4]{5] under meteorological definitions all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month{4] this meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year in which daylight predominates the meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in australia austria denmark the former soviet union and japan it is also used by many in the united kingdom in ireland the summer months according to the national meteorological service met xc3x89ireann are june july and august however according to the irish calendar summer begins on 1 may and ends on 1 august school textbooks in ireland follow the cultural norm of summer commencing on 1 may rather than the meteorological definition of 1 junedays continue to lengthen from equinox to solstice and summer days progressively shorten after the solstice so meteorological summer encompasses the build-up to the longest day and a diminishing thereafter with summer having many more hours of daylight than spring reckoning by hours of daylight alone summer solstice marks the midpoint not the beginning of the seasons midsummer takes place over the shortest night of the year which is the summer solstice or on a nearby date that varies with traditionwhere a seasonal lag of half a season or more is common reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season{6] by this method in north america summer is the period from the summer solstice (usually 20 or 21 june in the northern hemisphere) to the autumn equinox{7]{8]{9]reckoning by cultural festivals the summer season in the united states is commonly regarded as beginning on memorial day weekend (the last weekend in may) and ending on labor day weekend (the first weekend in september) more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather the similar canadian tradition starts summer on victoria day one week prior (although summer conditions vary widely across canada's expansive territory) and ends as in the united states on labour dayin chinese astronomy summer starts on or around 5 may with the jixc3xa9qxc3xac (solar term) known as lxc3xacxixc3xa0 (xe7xabx8bxe5xa4x8f) ie "establishment of summer" and it ends on or around 6 augustin southern and southeast asia where the monsoon occurs summer is more generally defined as lasting from march april may and june the warmest time of the year ending with the onset of the monsoon rains{citation needed]because the temperature lag is shorter in the oceanic temperate southern hemisphere{10] most countries in this region use the meteorological definition with summer starting on 1 december and ending on the last day of february{11]{12]weather{edit]wet season thunderstorm at night in darwin australiasee also: hail tropical cyclone and wet seasonsummer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather in the mediterranean regions it is also associated with dry weather while in other places (particularly in eastern asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather the wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime{13] where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds it is known as a monsoon{14]image of hurricane lester from late august 1992in the northern atlantic ocean a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 june to 30 november{15] the statistical peak of the atlantic hurricane season is 10 september the northeast pacific ocean has a broader period of activity but in a similar time frame to the atlantic{16] the northwest pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round with a minimum in february and march and a peak in early september in the north indian basin storms are most common from april to december with peaks in may and november{15] in the southern hemisphere the tropical cyclone season runs from 1 november until the end of april with peaks in mid-february to early march{15]{17]thunderstorm season in the united states and canada runs in the spring through summer these storms can produce hail strong winds and tornadoes usually during the afternoon and eveningholidays{edit]school breaks{edit]schools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days in almost all countries children are out of school during this time of year for summer break although dates vary in the united states public schools usually end in early june while colleges get out in early may although some schools get out on the last or second last thursday in may in england and wales school ends in mid-july and resumes again in early september; in scotland the summer holiday begins in late june and ends in mid- to late-august similarly in canada the summer holiday starts in late june and ends at the very start of september in russia the summer holiday begins at the end of may and ends on august 31 in the southern hemisphere school summer holiday dates include the major holidays of christmas and new year's day school summer holidays in australia new zealand and south africa begin in early-december and end in early february with the dates varying between states in india school ends in april and resumes in late june or early july in cameroon and nigeria schools usually go for summer vacation in mid-july and resume back in the later weeks of september or first week of octoberpublic holidays{edit]a wide range of public holidays fall during summer including:memorial day (united states) or

summer olympics in sydney however were held during the australian springsummer is usually a low point in television viewing and television schedules generally reflect this by not scheduling new episodes of their most popular shows between the end of may sweeps and the beginning of the television season in september instead scheduling low-cost reality television shows and burning off commitments to already-canceled series there is an exception to this with children's television many television shows made for children and are popular with children are released during the summer months especially on children's cable channels such as the disney channel in the united states as children are off school disney channel for example ends its preschool programming earlier in the day for older school age children in the summer months while it reverts to the original scheduling as the school year begins conversely the music and film industries generally experience higher returns during the summer than other times of the year and market their summer hits accordingly the summer season is also most popular for animated movies to be released theatrically in movie theaters{citation needed]with most school-age children and college students (except those attending summer school) on summer vacation during the summer months especially in the united states travel and vacationing traditionally peaks during the summer with the volume of travel in a typical summer weekend rivaled only by thanksgiving teenagers and college students often take summer jobs in
