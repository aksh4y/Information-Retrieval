names{edit]the arabian sea historically and geographically has been referred to by many different names by arab travellers and european geographers that include{3] indian sea persian sea sindhu sagar{4] erythraean sea{5] sindh sea{citation needed] and akhzar sea{citation needed]trade routes{edit]the arabian sea has been an important marine trade route since the era of the coastal sailing vessels from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium bce certainly the late 2nd millennium bce through the later days known as the age of sail by the time of julius caesar several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon water transport through the sea around the rough inland terrain features to its northnames routes and locations of the periplus of the erythraean seathese routes usually began in the far east or down river from madhya pradesh with transshipment via historic bharuch (bharakuccha) traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's iran then split around hadhramaut into two streams north into the gulf of aden and thence into the levant or south into alexandria via red sea ports such as axum each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiatesthis southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern arabian peninsula (yemen and oman today) was significant and the egyptian pharaohs built several shallow canals to service the trade one more or less along the route of today's suez canal and another from the red sea to the nile river both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge sand storms in antiquity later the kingdom of axum arose in ethiopia to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with europe via alexandriamajor ports{edit]the kochi port located on the south-west coast of india is the nearest indian port to the international shipping routes as well as one of the largest and busiest ports serving the arabian sea seen here is the international container transshipment terminal the only such facility in indiajawaharlal nehru port in mumbai is the largest port in the arabian sea and the largest container port in indiathe port of karachi (urdu: xd8xa8xd9x86xd8xafxd8xb1 xdaxafxd8xa7xdbx81 xd9x83xd8xb1xd8xa7xdax86xd9x89 bandargxc4x81h-i karxc4x81cxc4xab) is pakistan's largest and busiest seaport handling about 60 of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum) it is located between the karachi towns of kiamari and saddar close to the main business district and several industrial areas the geographic position of the port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the strait of hormuz the history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of karachi several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including "krokola" "morontobara" (woman's harbour) (mentioned by nearchus) barbarikon (the periplus of the erythraean sea and debal (a city invaded and captured by the muslim general muhammad bin qasim in 712 ad) there is a reference to the early existence of the port of karachi in the "umdah" by the arab navigator sulaiman al mahri (ad 1511) who mentions "ras al karazi" and "ras karashi" while describing a route along the coast from pasni to ras karashikarachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century turkish treatise mirat ul memalik (mirror of countries 1557) by the ottoman captain seydi ali reis which is a compilation of sailing directions from the portuguese island of diu to hormuz in the persian gulf it warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in "kaurashi" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerouslythe gate facing the sea was called "kharadar" (salt gate) and the gate facing the lyari river was called "mithadar" (sweet gate) the modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called mithadar and kharadar surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east the sea to the southwest and the lyari river to the north the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with muscat and bahrainthe port of karachi in pakistan's largest city karachi with some of the city's residential areas visible the port is one of the busiest in the arabian seathe gwadar port is a warm-water deep-sea port situated at gwadar in balochistan pakistan at the apex of the arabian sea and at the entrance of the persian gulf about 460xc2xa0km west of karachi and approximately 75xc2xa0km (47xc2xa0mi) east of pakistan's border with iran the port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the arabian sea from the coastlineport of salalah in salalah oman is also a major port in the area from a modest start in 1997 the omani container transhipment port has achieved consistent growth it is a key container transhipment hub on the arabian sea and is often used as the first port of call for vessels whose crew have just been released from the clutches of somali pirates following ransom payments for withheld vessels and crew the port also plays host as a supply base for the visiting warships that provide protective escorts for merchant shipping in the sea lanes from that dual role has emerged another one as an intelligence networkxc2xa0xe2x80x94 both military and civilianxc2xa0xe2x80x94 to exchange information on possible pirate sightings and near misses also the international task force often uses the port as a base there is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port which makes it a very safe bubble the port handled just under 35m teu{clarification needed] in 2009{6]major indian ports in the arabian sea are mundra port kandla port nava sheva kochi port mumbai port and mormugxc3xa3o{7]{8]islands{edit]there

hills' is a small uninhabited island in the northern tip of the arabian sea in pakistan's territorial waters it is a popular eco-tourism destination in the region overnight tourists camp on the island and bring their own provisions camping fishing and scuba-diving expeditions are popular it is also a site for observing turtle breeding endangered animals such as the green turtle (chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill turtle (eretmochelys imbracata) nest on the beach at the foot of the cliffs the island is also a very important area for endemic reptiles such as the astola viper (echis carinatus

being part of a small archipelago of four islands it lies some 240 kilometres (150xc2xa0mi) east of the horn of africa and 380 kilometres (240xc2xa0mi) south of the arabian peninsula the island is very isolated and through the process of speciation a third of its plant life is found nowhere else on the planet it has been described as the most alien-looking place on earthmasirah (arabic: xd9x85xd8xb5xd9x8axd8xb1xd8xa9xe2x80x8exe2x80x8e) is an island off the east coast of oman the main industries here are fishing and traditional textile manufacturing formerly traditional ship building was important the rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked dhows on the beaches of the island most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat the ocean bottom environment surrounding masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock despite the poor quality ocean bottom the area is very productive with marine fisheries and any hard objects (barrels engines) are immediately colonized by local faunasee also{edit]erythraean seanorth indian ocean tropical cyclonepiracy off the coast
