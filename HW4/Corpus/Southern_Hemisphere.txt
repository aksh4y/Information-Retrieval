000000a photo of earth from apollo 17 (blue marble) originally had the south pole at the top; however it was turned upside-down to fit the traditional perspectivethe southern hemisphere highlighted in yellow (antarctica not depicted)the southern hemisphere from above the south polethe southern hemisphere is the half sphere of earth which is south of the equator it contains all or parts of five continents{1] (antarctica australia about 90 of south america the southern third of africa and several southern islands off the continental mainland of asia) four oceans (indian south atlantic southern and south pacific) and most of the pacific islands in oceania its surface is 809 water compared with 607 water in the case of the northern hemisphere and it contains 327 of earth's land{2]owing to the tilt of earth's rotation relative to the sun and the ecliptic plane summer is from december to march and winter is from june to september september 22 or 23 is the vernal equinox and march 20 or 21 is the autumnal equinox the south pole is in the middle of the southern hemispherical regioncontents1 characteristics2 demographics3 list of continents and countries31 continents and microcontinents32 countries and territories4 references5 see alsocharacteristics{edit]southern hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere except in the antarctic which is colder than the arctic this is because the southern hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than landaurora australis appearing in the night sky of swifts creek 100xc2xa0km (62xc2xa0mi) north of lakes entrance victoria australiaaurora australis appearing from stewart island  rakiura in the south of new zealandin the southern hemisphere the sun passes from east to west through the north although north of the tropic of capricorn the mean sun can be directly overhead or due south at midday the sun rotating through the north causes an apparent right-left trajectory through the sky unlike the left-right motion of the sun when seen from the northern hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky sun-cast shadows turn anticlockwise throughout the day and sundials have the hours increasing in the anticlockwise direction during solar eclipses viewed from a point to the south of the tropic of capricorn the moon moves from left to right on the disc of the sun (see for example photos with timings of the solar eclipse of november 13 2012) while viewed from a point to the north of the tropic of cancer (iexc2xa0in the northern hemisphere) the moon moves from right to left during solar eclipsescyclones and tropical storms spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere (as opposed to anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere) due to the coriolis effect{3]the southern temperate zone a subsection of the southern hemisphere is nearly all oceanic this zone includes the southern tip of uruguay and south africa; the southern half of chile and argentina; parts of australia going south from adelaide and all of new zealandthe sagittarius constellation that includes the galactic centre is a southern constellation and this combined with clearer skies makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the southern hemisphere with brighter and more numerous starsforests in the southern hemisphere have special features which set them apart from those in the northern hemisphere both chile and australia share for example unique beech species or nothofagus and new zealand has members of the closely related genera lophozonia and fuscospora the eucalyptus is native to australia but is now also planted in southern africa and latin america for pulp production and increasingly biofuel usesdemographics{edit]approximately 800000000 humans live in the southern hemisphere representing only 10xe2x80x9312 of the total global human population of 73 billion{4]{5] portuguese is the most spoken language in the southern hemisphere{6]list of continents and countries{edit]continents and microcontinents{edit]africa (about one-third from south of somalia in the east to south of libreville
