counties lying on the potomac east of the mountains in 1863 with the consent of the reorganized government of virginia had supposedly voted in favor of annexation to west virginia however many voters were absent in the confederate army when the vote was taken and they refused to accept the transfer upon their return the virginia general assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against west virginia asking the supreme court to declare the counties still part of virginia congress on march 10 1866 passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer in 1871 the us supreme
