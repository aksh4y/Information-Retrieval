however seasonal rainfall is the opposite of that of the subtropical humid type with a winter or cool season rainfall peak being typical these climates occur near the rimlands of the mediterranean sea in western australia in california and in the southernmost areas of south africathe oceanic climates occur in the higher middle latitudes between 45xc2xb0 and 60xc2xb0 north and south latitude they are created by the onshore flow from the cool high latitude oceans to their west this causes the climate to have cool summers and cool (but not cold) winters these climates are frequently cloudy annual rainfall is spread throughout the entire year regions with this climate include western europe northwestern north america and parts of new zealandthe continental climates occur in middle latitudes between 35xc2xb0 or 40xc2xb0 and 55xc2xb0 these climates are normally inland or on leeward sides of landmasses they feature warm to hot summers and cold winters with a large interseasonal temperature variation regions with this climate include northern temperate asia the northern united states southern canada and parts of northeastern europethe vast majority of the world's human population resides in temperate zones especially in the northern hemisphere due to its greater mass of land{6] the richest temperate flora in the world is found in southern africa where some 24000 taxa (species and infraspecific taxa) have been described{7]agriculture{edit]farming is a large-scale practice in the temperate regions due to the plentiful rainfall and warm summers because most agricultural activity occurs in the spring and summer cold winters have a small effect on agricultural production extreme winters or summers have a huge impact on the productivity of agriculture{8]urbanization{edit]temperate regions have the majority of the world's population which leads to large cities there are a couple factors why the climate of large city landscapes differs from the climate of rural areas one factor is the strength of the absorption rate of builds and asphalt which is higher than natural land the other large factor is the burning of fossil fuels from buildings and vehicles these factors have led to the average climate of cities to be warmer than surrounding areas{8]see also{edit]geographical zonehabitat (ecology)kxc3xb6ppen climate classificationmiddle latitudespolar circlereceptivereferences{edit]^ education scotland "weather  climate change climates around the world" educationscotlandgovukxc2xa0^ "latitude  climate zones" the environmental literacy council retrieved 15 july 2017xc2xa0^ "patterns of climate" retrieved 15 july 2017xc2xa0^ mccoll r w (2005) encyclopedia of world geography volume 1 (facts on file library of world geography) new york: facts on file pxc2xa0919 isbnxc2xa00-816-05786-9xc2xa0^ "solar illumination: seasonal and diurnal patterns" encyclopediacom retrieved october 4 2012xc2xa0^ cohen joel e;
