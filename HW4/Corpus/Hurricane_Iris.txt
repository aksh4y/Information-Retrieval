hurricane seasonhurricane iris of 2001 was the most destructive hurricane in belize since hurricane hattie in 1961 iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season behind hurricane michelle{1] it was the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and third major hurricane{nb 1] of the year forming from a tropical wave on octoberxc2xa04 just southeast of barbados it moved westward through the caribbean intensifying into a tropical storm on octoberxc2xa05 south of puerto rico and into a hurricane the following day while passing south of the dominican republic iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides killing eight people later the hurricane passed south of jamaica where it destroyed two houses on reaching the western caribbean sea iris rapidly intensified into a categoryxc2xa04 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale a small hurricane with an eye of only 7xc2xa0mi (11xc2xa0km) in diameter iris reached peak winds of 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) before making landfall in southern belize near monkey river town on octoberxc2xa09 the hurricane quickly dissipated over central america although its remnants contributed to the formation of tropical storm manuel in the eastern pacific oceandestruction was heaviest in belize and totaled 250xc2xa0million (2001xc2xa0usd){nb 2] because iris was compact the damage was largely confined to 72 of the houses in the toledo district and 50 of the houses in the stann creek district the hurricane damaged or destroyed 3718xc2xa0homes nationwide and wrecked more than 95 of the homes in 35xc2xa0villages in the poorest parts of the country iris left about 15000xc2xa0people homeless many receiving assistance from the government and the local red cross chapter high winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops mostly affecting the banana industry iris killed 24xc2xa0people in belize including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near big creek the storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2500xc2xa0homes in neighboring guatemala and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern mexico where two people diedcontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 lesser and greater antilles32 offshore33 belize34 elsewhere in central america4 aftermath5 see also6 notes7 references8 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaletoward the end of september 2001 a poorly defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean through an area of hostile wind shear which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough to the northeast of the lesser antilles{3] a few days later the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the caribbean sea allowing for an upper-level ridge or high-pressure area to form over the tropical wave the change provided a favorable environment for tropical development and an area of convection soon blossomed along the wave's axis as the tropical wave approached the lesser antilles a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined the system increased in organization enough to be classified as tropical depression eleven at 12:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa04 located about 100xc2xa0mi (160xc2xa0km) southeast of barbados{3] operationally however hurricane hunters did not confirm the depression's formation until nine hours later{4]in its early stages the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of st vincent and st lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north compared to its appearance 24xc2xa0hours before forming the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized{4] this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into the system which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery{5] at 21:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa05 they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74xc2xa0mph (119xc2xa0kmh) corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) based on these data the depression was upgraded to tropical storm iris situated about 155xc2xa0mi (250xc2xa0km) south of the southern coast of puerto rico{6] in post-season analysis the national hurricane center (nhc) estimated that iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier{3]hurricane iris in the western caribbean sea on october 8despite the storm's intensification and well-organized satellite appearance the circulation failed to become better defined{3] in their first discussion on iris the nhc mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed{4] one forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south{6] although its overall appearance did not change significantly the hurricane hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23xc2xa0mi (37xc2xa0km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on octoberxc2xa06{7] later that day iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the dominican republic{3] and the nhc remarked that land interaction with the greater antilles was the only factor impeding further development{8] after iris reached winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) early on octoberxc2xa07 its intensity remained steady for about 24xc2xa0hours{3] during that time the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted possibly due to an upper-level low{9] by late on octoberxc2xa07 the area of hurricanexc2xa0force winds associated with iris extended only 25xc2xa0mi (35xc2xa0km) from its 16xc2xa0mi (22xc2xa0km) wide eye{10]{11]early on octoberxc2xa08 after turning west-southwestward away from the greater antilles iris began strengthening again with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear the nhc predicted peak winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) before the storm would hit belize{12] it rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions intensifying from 95xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) to 140xc2xa0mph (225xc2xa0kmh) in a 12-hour period on octoberxc2xa08 making iris a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale; in the same duration the minimum central pressure dropped 38xc2xa0mbar (112xc2xa0inhg){3] while intensifying the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7xc2xa0mi (11xc2xa0km){13] for comparison the smallest known eye diameter on record for an atlantic hurricane was about 3xc2xa0mi (5xc2xa0km) during hurricane wilma in 2005{14] with such a small eye a hurricane hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of iris{13] and shortly after the flight the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the honduras coastline just offshore this resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle but within a few hours iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) just off belize at 02:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa09 it made landfall at peak intensity in monkey river town in the southern portion of belize{3]initially hurricane iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing central america and to re-intensify in the eastern pacific ocean; had it done so it would have retained the name iris{13] instead the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of guatemala and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm late on octoberxc2xa09 within sixteen hours of landfall the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern mexico{3] as the remnants approached the pacific ocean a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of iris it gradually organized while continuing westward developing into tropical storm manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until octoberxc2xa018 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear{15]preparations{edit]over a stretch of four days sixteen tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with iris affecting the dominican republic the cuban provinces of granma and santiago de cuba jamaica cayman islands the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula guatemala honduras and belize{3] the threat from iris prompted the jamaica national emergency operations center to be activated shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused{16]in belize a hurricane warning was issued about 23xc2xa0hours before iris moved ashore{3] a state of national emergency was declared on octoberxc2xa08 as hurricane iris neared landfall all emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts{17] a mandatory evacuation was issued for stann creek and toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands the main hospital in belize city was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order{18] overall 11380xc2xa0people evacuated their homes in belize{19] including many in belize city{20] these evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll{21] hurricane keith had struck the nation a year prior preparing some citizens for what to expect{20] disaster response teams arrived the day after iris was projected to make landfall pan american health organization staff were on standby in belize guatemala and honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks{18]on octoberxc2xa08 the government of honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions advising residents to expect "extreme weather conditions"{22] about 5000xc2xa0people in the country evacuated from their homes to the north of belize officials in mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports{23]impact{edit]death toll by

and thunderstorms{24] in the dominican republic iris dropped around 3xc2xa0in (76xc2xa0mm) of rainfall along the coast forcing 35xc2xa0families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks the rains triggered a landslide outside of santo domingo that destroyed a home killing a family of three there was another landslide in the region that injured two people{25] iris's passage near jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others causing one injury otherwise damage in the country was minimal{16]offshore{edit]a 120xc2xa0ft (37xc2xa0m) scuba diving boat overturned during the hurricane near big creek belize possibly hit by a tornado{26] the boat named the wave dancer had 28xc2xa0people on board{3] including 20 from the richmond dive club out of richmond virginia; most of them were upstairs in the boat and none were diving the captain had delayed returning to shore and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock not anticipating the ferocity{27] iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock causing it to overturn in 12xc2xa0ft (37xc2xa0m) waters{26]{27] eight people survived and 11xc2xa0bodies were recovered; it was presumed that 20xc2xa0people died during the wreck{3] including 15 from the richmond area and three crew members{26]another boat the vendera also reportedly capsized with people on board{3]belize{edit]wettest

145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) although the highest measured winds were 106xc2xa0mph (171xc2xa0kmh) at a station in big creek because of its small diameter iris produced heavy damage only in a 70xc2xa0mi (110xc2xa0km) area of southern belize in that region the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m){3] with waves of over 13xc2xa0ft (40xc2xa0m) in height{21] causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes{35]as it moved ashore iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages{36] in 35xc2xa0villages the storm destroyed more than 95 of the buildings{37] its small size confined the worst damage largely to toledo and stann creek districts which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country{21]{38] the percentage of damaged houses was 72 in toledo district and about 50 in stann creek{39] leaving about 15000xc2xa0people homeless{40] in both districts the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies{37] in the worst-affected areas poor mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned{37] at placencia near the coast about 80 of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage with downed power poles in the streets{21] about 90 of the houses in nearby seine bight were destroyed{41] and where iris made landfall over 90 of the homes were destroyed throughout monkey river town{21] the storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern belize iris also damaged tourism facilities including minor impact to the maya ruins of belize{42] and damaged 20 of the hotel rooms in the country accounting for 37xc2xa0million in losses{43] the remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm{44]in southern belize the storm's strong winds left crop damage in some cases where the harvest had just begun about 5000 acres (2000xc2xa0ha) of bananas were destroyed along with over 3500 acres (1400xc2xa0ha) of rice 3000 acres (1200xc2xa0ha) of corn and other crops to a lesser degree{42] the storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock the shrimp industry lost 25 of its catch{42] partly due to contaminated waters{45] crop damage in belize was estimated at 103xc2xa0million{43] mostly from banana losses{42] iris's strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest with upwards of 40 of trees affected in some areas{42] this disrupted the habitats of several animals and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near monkey river were killed{46] the storm's strong waves eroded the beach although marine effects were much less than those of hurricane keith in the previous year{42] nevertheless there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter{46]nationwide iris damaged or destroyed 3718xc2xa0homes{47] directly affecting a total of 21568xc2xa0people{38] or 85 of the total population{48] the storm damaged or destroyed 31xc2xa0schools and 17xc2xa0health facilities{38] along with 21xc2xa0government buildings{49] there was about 25xc2xa0million in damage to the transportation sector including highways and bridges{43] iris killed 24xc2xa0people in and around the country{50] including the victims of the wave dancer shipwreck{51] overall damage was estimated at 250xc2xa0million{52] making it the most damaging storm in the country since hurricane hattie in 1961{44]elsewhere in central america{edit]high tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both guatemala and honduras{20] in the former the hurricane's rainfall generally amounted to 3 to 4xc2xa0in (76 to 102xc2xa0mm) triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100xc2xa0people{53] the damage was heaviest in petxc3xa9n department in the northern portion of the country{54] the storm damaged 26xc2xa0schools and 2500xc2xa0homes in the country's interior{55]{56] an estimated 27500xc2xa0people were affected by the storm throughout guatemala{53] there were eight deaths in the country{3] two of them the result of falling trees{57]the remnants of iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern mexico accumulating 480xc2xa0in (122xc2xa0mm) in the southern state of chiapas{58] in oaxaca the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120xc2xa0houses a mudslide in one village demolished 20xc2xa0homes and killed a child while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river{59]aftermath{edit]on octoberxc2xa09 the government of belize issued the "all clear" signal indicating that the storm had fully passed and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment{60] the government declared stann creek and toledo districts as disaster areas{45] and officials declared a nighttime curfew by the day after the storm struck the airport in belize city had been reopened and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal{41] residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water forcing them to drink unclean water{37] officials sent medical teams to southern belize in the most affected areas{21] the belmopan red cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money clothing and food for storm victims{41] the red cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7000xc2xa0people{51] by octoberxc2xa019 most roads in southern belize were reopened the belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs and officials authorized spending 12xc2xa0million to rebuild damaged homes to assist the farmers who lost crops the belize government provided 18000xc2xa0lb (8200xc2xa0kg) of maize seeds as well as fertilizer{39] after the storm the world food programme and the belize red cross collectively provided food for the 9000xc2xa0families in need of subsidence{61] by octoberxc2xa031 the red cross had provided blankets tarps and hygienic supplies to 4800xc2xa0people severely affected by the storm{62] homes were gradually repaired and crop production returned to normal by early 2002 around christmas of 2001 the belize red cross provided presents to school children in 14xc2xa0villages affected by the storm{47] the lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22 in 2002 although sales gradually recovered{63]the government of belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following iris's landfall{64] and various countries provided aid{41] the united kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water the united states also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting{65] although sustaining significant damage the government of guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in belize{66] mexico sent blankets mattresses food and water as well as a medical team{65] the japanese government sent tents and blankets{67] and the chinese government donated 500xc2xa0lb (230xc2xa0kg) of rice and dried fruits{65] various united nations departments donated about 225000{41]the american victims of the wave dancer boat wreck were flown back to the richmond virginia area following the storm{26] the insurance company covering the boat reached a 4xc2xa0million settlement which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims' families the boat operator remained in business following the accident{27]following the major damage in belize the name iris was retired in the spring of 2002 by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was subsequently replaced by the name ingrid and was first used during the 2007 season{68]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of retired atlantic
