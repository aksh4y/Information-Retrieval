tropical storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1998 atlantic hurricane season it became the most destructive storm of the season and the costliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane andrew in 1992 and the deadliest since hurricane gordon in 1994 georges killed 604xc2xa0people mainly on the island of hispaniola and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10xc2xa0billion (1998 us dollars equivalent to 17xc2xa0billion in 2016) in damages mostly in st kitts and nevis puerto rico and hispaniolathe hurricane made landfall in at least seven different countries (antigua and

saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave exited the coast of africa on september 13 moving westward the large system quickly developed a closed circulation and was classified tropical depression seven on september 15 a strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on september 16 georges's circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized central dense overcast and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone georges attained hurricane status late on september 17{1]georges near the florida keysconditions became nearly ideal for continued development including warm water temperatures low-level inflow to the hurricane's north and good upper-level outflow a banding eye developed and georges reached major hurricane strength on september 19 while 675xc2xa0mi (1085xc2xa0km) east-southeast of guadeloupe by september 19 an upper-level anticyclone was well established over georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly as indicated by the cooling cloud tops increased symmetry of the deep convection and the warming and contracting of the well-defined 40xc2xa0mi (63xc2xa0km) wide eye as rapid intensification continued and georges peaked at a very dangerous category 4 storm with 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on september 19 and early september 20 at that time georges was the most intense strongest storm since hurricane hugo and alongside hurricane luis it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the atlantic with hurricane force windfields extending more than 150xc2xa0mi (250xc2xa0km) from the center and with a more than 300xc2xa0mi (490xc2xa0km) wide tropical storm force windfield shortly after peaking upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on september 20 in the afternoon as the central pressure had risen 26 mb as georges approached the leeward islands{1]on september 21 after weakening considerably category 3 georges made landfall directly on antigua and three hours later in st kitts though its 175 xc2xa0mi (280xc2xa0km) wide tropical storm force windfield affected all the leeward islands after weakening to a category 2 hurricane over the caribbean upper-level shear decreased and georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near fajardo puerto rico as a 115xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) category 3 hurricane early in the morning over the mountainous terrain of the island the hurricane weakened again but over the mona passage it again re-intensified to hit eastern dominican republic with winds of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) on september 22 like in puerto rico georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain and after crossing the windward passage it struck 30xc2xa0mi (48xc2xa0km) east of guantxc3xa1namo bay cuba on september 23 well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island georges retained minimal hurricane status{1]hurricane georges reached the straits of florida on september 24 and as it had done earlier in its lifetime quickly restrengthened to categoryxc2xa02 status on the september 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear it continued to the west-northwest and struck key west later on september 25 with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) despite moving over warmer water georges only managed to peak at 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) in the gulf of mexico likely due to its disrupted inner core a mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward forcing georges to make its seventh and final landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 28 within 24xc2xa0hours georges had weakened to a tropical depression and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern mississippi then drifted to the east the weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the florida panhandle and dissipated on october 1 near the floridageorgia border{1]preparations{edit]lesser antilles{edit]main article: effects of hurricane georges in the lesser antilleshurricane georges near peak intensity on septemberxc2xa020late on septemberxc2xa018 a hurricane watch was issued for saint lucia anguilla saba and sint maarten; it was extended to include the british and united states virgin islands on the following day later on septemberxc2xa019 a hurricane warning was put into effect for islands between dominica and anguilla as well as saint martin but excluding saint barthxc3xa9lemy early on the following day a tropical storm warning was issued for saint lucia and martinique about six hours later the hurricane warning issued on septemberxc2xa019 was extended on septemberxc2xa020 to include islands north and west of dominica until puerto rico simultaneously the tropical storm warning in effect for saint lucia and martinique was discontinued by later on septemberxc2xa021 the hurricane warning was canceled for all islands east of the virgin islands including antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin at 0300xc2xa0utc on the following day the hurricane warning was extended to include the british and united states virgin islands though six hours later it was also discontinued{1]several hundred people on the island of montserrat went into twelve hurricane shelters as georges passed by with winds of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh){2] on septemberxc2xa018 the national disaster preparedness committee in dominica began meetings to prepare for possible impacts from georges residents began stocking up on supplies by this time for the following two days the island was placed under a state of high-alert as direct impact from a category 4 hurricane was anticipated by the following morning most businesses had boarded up their windows and roads were quiet officials declared that schools would be closed on septemberxc2xa021 and shelters across the island were opened{3]greater antilles{edit]main articles: effects of hurricane georges in puerto rico effects of hurricane georges in the dominican republic effects of hurricane georges in haiti and effects of hurricane georges in cubageorges off the eastern cuban coastbeginning at 21:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa021 with a hurricane watch for puerto rico the nhc and national governments in the greater antilles and the bahamas issued a number of tropical cyclone watches and warnings in anticipation of the hurricane as the storm progressed across the islands the warnings were gradually canceled until the government of cuba discontinued a hurricane watch at 03:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa026{1]in the days prior to the hurricane's arrival thousands of citizens in the leeward islands and puerto rico prepared for the major hurricane by boarding windows and purchasing supplies puerto rican governor pedro rossellxc3xb3 activated the island's national guard opened 416xc2xa0shelters and enacted a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales more than 28000xc2xa0people across the island evacuated their homes to the shelters in the northern portion of the island both the federal emergency management agency (fema) and the american red cross deployed workers there with supplies for a potentially deadly event{4]{5]due to initial forecasts of the hurricane brushing the northern portion of the country the dominican republic was caught off guard instead like in puerto rico georges traversed the entire country and passed close to santo domingo neighboring haiti expected the worst opening shelters and evacuating vulnerable people from low-lying coastal areas{6]prior to making landfall more than 200000xc2xa0people were evacuated from coastal areas in eastern cuba in the potentially impacted area cuba's revolutionary army was sent to farm lands to harvest crops that could be destroyed during the storm members of the cuban government travelled door-to-door to alert everyone of the hurricane in addition to this president fidel castro spoke live on national television to explain the country's plans to withstand the hurricane as well as ensuring a quick recovery effort by using all of the nation's resources{7]united states{edit]main articles: effects of hurricane georges in florida effects of hurricane georges in louisiana effects of hurricane georges in alabama and effects of hurricane georges in mississippigeorges making landfall in biloxi mississippiinitial forecasts of a southeastern florida landfall forced over 12xc2xa0million to evacuate including much of the florida keys despite the mandatory evacuation order 20000xc2xa0people including over 7000xc2xa0key west citizens refused to leave some of those who remained to ride out the storm were shrimpers whose boats were their entire livelihood insurance companies refused to insure some of the older shrimp boats leading shrimpers to ride it out with all they had left{8] due to lack of law enforcement those who stayed in key west went through red lights double-parked and disobeyed traffic laws long-time florida keys citizens noted the solitude of the time and enjoyed the island for how it once was rather than the large crowds of tourists{9]in the northern gulf of mexico georges was forecast to attain major hurricane status and make landfall in southeastern louisiana because of this portions of the state were evacuated including new orleans there the louisiana superdome was for the first time in its history used as a refuge of last resort for those unable to evacuate new orleans more than 14000xc2xa0citizens rode out the storm in the facility causing difficulties to supply necessities the building had no problems related to the weather though evacuees looted the building stole furniture and damaged property however the damage was much less than in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 many citizens in southern mississippi were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation of those in the evacuation area 60 actually left most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm of those who left most went to a relative's house in their own county{10] prior to making landfall georges's track was very uncertain this forced for the mandatory evacuations of alabama's two coastal counties baldwin and mobile counties with a combined population of over 500000xc2xa0people{11] despite the order only 67 of the area actually left to a safer place most of those who remained stayed because they believed their house would be able to withstand the hurricane the majority of those who did leave went to a relative's house in a safer portion of the state{10] in the days before making landfall only 22 of the population in recommended evacuation areas along the florida panhandle actually left however most of them were prepared to leave if the situation became worse those who did leave were concerned about the severity of the storm while those who stayed felt their home was safe enough for the hurricane's effects floridians who evacuated typically left for a friend or relative's house and only went to another area of their county{10]impact{edit]impact by areacountrystatedeathsdamagerefantigua and

the costliest disaster aid in the program's 125-year history{1]leeward islands{edit]main article: effects of hurricane georges in the lesser antillesupon moving through the leeward islands georges brought strong winds and heavy rainfall amounting to a maximum of 75xc2xa0inches (190xc2xa0mm) at st john{1]antigua{edit]in antigua strong winds caused severe property damage mostly caused to roofs 10xe2x80x9320 of houses were greatly impacted including three schools high winds during the passage of the hurricane downed telephone and power lines causing loss of communication and power across much of the island{18] an unofficial wind observation from antigua reported winds at 94xc2xa0mph with gusts to 116xc2xa0mph{19] between barbuda and antigua georges killed 3 people left 3800 homeless and resulting at 160 million damage{20]guadeloupe{edit]the weakening hurricane spared the island as it passed 25 miles (40xc2xa0km) to the north causing moderate damage (houses and roofs uprooted trees power lines and outages beach erosion) especially in grande-terre in basse-terre minor to moderate damage was common; the worst damage was to the banana crops 85 to 100 devastated with a cost of 100 millions of francs (22 millions usd) the maximal rainfall was 5 to 6xc2xa0inches in this areathe met office in desirade east of guadeloupe had a 75 miles per hour (121xc2xa0kmh) wind and a 88

avoidst kitts and nevis{edit]after passing through antigua georges produced strong winds of up to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) while passing over st kitts georges caused catastrophic damage downing power lines telephone lines and trees across the island lack of electricity resulted in damage to water facilities as well georges's high winds caused extensive property damage damaging 80xe2x80x9385 of the houses on the island and destroying 20xe2x80x9325 of homes many schools businesses hospitals and government buildings lost their roofs while the airport experienced severe damage to its main terminal and control tower limiting flights to the daytime st kitts' economy was disrupted from severe agricultural losses including the devastation of 50 of their sugar crop in addition damaged hotels and piers created a long-term impact through lack of tourismxe2x80x94an industry the island relies on in all hurricane georges caused 5xc2xa0fatalities left 3000xc2xa0homeless and resulted in 458xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd) in damage on the island{21]in the other part of the country nevis fared better like on st kitts high winds downed power and telephone lines damaging the water system there 35 of homes on the island were damaged though none were destroyed rainfall and debris killed several hundred livestock and seriously damaged coconut trees amounting to 25xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd) in agricultural damage there were no casualties reported on the island and damaged amounted to 39xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd){21]damage in st kitts totaled ec12xc2xa0billion (us458 million){22] total damage on nevis amounted to 39xc2xa0million{23] the total damage from the storm was nearly twice the country's gross domestic product of us271xc2xa0million{24]british virgin islands{edit]no major damage was reported to public buildings in the british virgin islands some of the islands' homes had roofs blown off the environment suffered major damage there were many reports of eroded soil in areas where construction was in progress some of the soils were planted on roads in mangrove farms and in the sea which could have potentially killed sea life{12] national parks around the islands suffered minor damage except for queen elizabeth park which had many fallen trees none of the schools in the area suffered any damage and opened again four days after georges had passed there were no fatalities in the islands and one minor injury was reported there was no major damage to the islands' medical buildings pipe damage was found in two areas but there was no damage to the sewage systems the total damage in the british virgin islands was valued at us9404 million{12]us virgin islands{edit]director of the virgin islands water and power authority showing the islands' improved power grid structuresas georges moved through the northern end of the lesser antilles it produced significant rainfall and strong winds over the united states virgin islands maximum rainfalls reached 679 inches (172xc2xa0mm) at the airport in st croix and 526 inches (134xc2xa0mm) at st thomas airport the strongest sustained winds and gusts were recorded on st croix as well measuring 74xc2xa0mph (119xc2xa0kmh) and 91xc2xa0mph (146xc2xa0kmh) respectively{25] a total of 20 homes were destroyed and 50 others sustained damage most of the losses were confined to agriculture and livestock{26] fifty-five boats were sunk across the islands several power lines were downed throughout st croix by high winds leaving some residences without power{25] however compared to the intensity of georges during its passage of the islands relatively few people 15 of the island's customers lost power this was due to the improved power grid set up across the island for this type of event{27] total losses on the island were estimated at 2xc2xa0million (1998 usd){28]in other nearby islands georges impact was relatively minor to moderate power outages flooding and minor to moderate structural damage was common{11]puerto rico{edit]main article: effects of hurricane georges in puerto ricodamage from mudslidesgeorges was the first hurricane to cross the entire island of puerto rico since the san ciprian hurricane in 1932{29] the hurricane brought storm surge peaking at an estimated 10-ft (3xc2xa0m) in height in fajardo along with tides up to 20xc2xa0ft (6xc2xa0m) above normal{1]{30] the hurricane spawned two f2 tornadoes on the island though they caused little damage georges dropped immense precipitation in the mountain regions peaking at 3051xc2xa0in (775xc2xa0mm) in jayuya with many other locations reporting at least 1xc2xa0ft (300xc2xa0mm) of precipitation{1]{31] hurricane-force winds were observed throughout the island sustained winds and gusts reached 87xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) and 107xc2xa0mph (172xc2xa0kmh) respectively at the roosevelt roads naval station in ceiba unofficially a sustained wind speed of 102xc2xa0mph (164xc2xa0kmh) and a gust of 164xc2xa0mph (264xc2xa0kmh) were observed in isabela{1]the mountain flooding drained off in the island's rivers causing every river to overflow its banks near the coast the surfeit of water carved new channels from the record discharge rate the storm's strong winds caused beach erosion in many places along the coastline eroded beaches flooding and debris left many roads impassable or destroyed isolating some areas on the western portion of the island{29] georges's deluge of rainfall caused significant damage to the agricultural industry including the loss of 75 of its coffee crop 95 of its banana or plantain crop and 65 of its live poultrypuerto rico damageits large circulation brought fierce winds to the entire island damaging 72605xc2xa0houses and destroying 28005xc2xa0others this left tens of thousands homeless after the storm's passage{1] over 22000xc2xa0people were sheltered in 139xc2xa0shelters in cities throughout the island all shelters experienced power outages and after the storm passed through lack of water and sewer systems became a serious problem{10] high winds downed nearly half of the island's electric and telephone lines leaving 96 of the population powerless and 84 of telephone customers without service lack of electricity greatly damaged the water system resulting in the loss of water and sewer service for 75 of the island{29] in the nearby small island of culebra georges destroyed 74xc2xa0houses and damaged 89xc2xa0others although damage estimates are not available there{29]in all georges caused 36xc2xa0billion in damage and there were no direct casualties due to well-executed warnings{1] however georges indirectly caused eight deaths in puerto rico two deaths occurred due to carbon monoxide poisoning from operating a gasoline-powered generator indoors while two other people were hospitalized for the same issue four other fatalities occurred after a lit candle started a house fire additionally there was one death each from head trauma and electrocution in the aftermath of the hurricane{32]hispaniola{edit]though there are no recorded amounts satellite-derived rainfall estimates show up to 39xc2xa0inches (990xc2xa0mm) of rain falling in the mountainous terrain of the countries this heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides and flooding killing a total of 589xc2xa0people across the island and leaving more than 350000 homeless{1]dominican republic{edit]see also: effects of hurricane georges in the dominican republictoppled trees blocked hundreds of streets in santo domingoin the dominican republic georges brought strong winds and very heavy rains along with a 7-foot (2xc2xa0m) storm surge nearly 10 xc2xa0hours of continuous rainfall resulted in mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country damaging many cities along the southern coastline including the capital 120xc2xa0mph (193xc2xa0kmh) winds downed and uprooted trees across much of the country littering streets with debris and mud thousands of houses were destroyed while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds the entire country was without electricity during the aftermath of the storm damaging water and communication systems{33] heavy wind damage and flooding caused extensive damage to the airport in santo domingo restricting usage to military and non-commercial flights{34]most impacted by hurricane georges was the agricultural industry the areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the country's main crop-growing areas including the provinces around santo domingo after a severe drought in 1997 extreme rainfall damaged around 470000 acres (190202xc2xa0ha) of food crops including various types of vegetables fruits and rootsxc2xa0xe2x80x94 some of the country's main diet food substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations the country's most important export crop were severely damaged the extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry an important economy in the area the dominican republic had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the losses{35]death toll reports were slow in the wake of the storm but a total of 380xc2xa0people died from hurricane georges{1] damage in the dominican republic amounted to 12xc2xa0billion (1998xc2xa0usd 18xc2xa0billion 2009xc2xa0usd){36]haiti{edit]main article: effects of hurricane georges in haitiupon reaching haiti georges was a weakened hurricane but it still brought heavy rainfall across the entire country the capital city of port-au-prince was largely unharmed with the exception of flooding in low-lying coastal areas damaging the main commercial port{34] the rest of the country however experienced a significant number of mudslides due to deforestation along the mountains{37] these mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses leaving 167332xc2xa0homeless{1] damage was greatest along the northern coastline from cap-haxc3xaftien to gonaxc3xafves due to the flooding and mudslides{38] on the southern coast the head of a us-based medical team stranded for several days by flooding in the remote town of belle anse anticipated a rise in malnutrition disease homelessness and poverty{39]{40] lack of electricity led to a total disruption of haiti's water supply system causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the western hemisphere{41] in all 209xc2xa0people died in haiti{1]like in the dominican republic the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage after a severe drought in 1997 georges's severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly most of the country's significant crop land including artibonite valley suffered total losses up to 80 of banana plantations were lost while vegetable roots tubers and other food crops were ruined in addition thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost{35] total agricultural losses amounted to 179xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd 250xc2xa0million 2009xc2xa0usd){42] the country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious losses{35]cuba{edit]see also: effects of hurricane georges in cubaupon making landfall hurricane georges produced torrential rainfall amounting to a maximum of 2441xc2xa0inches (620xc2xa0mm) at limonar in the province of guantxc3xa1namo several other locations reported over a foot (300xc2xa0mm) of precipitation as well{1] storm surge of 4xc2xa0xe2x80x93 6xc2xa0feet (1xc2xa0xe2x80x93 2xc2xa0m) was expected along the eastern coastline along with dangerous waves on top of the surge though winds were reduced by the time georges hit cuba it still retained winds of 75xc2xa0mph (121xc2xa0kmh) along with stronger gusts in squalls{43]the hurricane's heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain this combined with strong winds damaged 60475xc2xa0homes of which 3481 were completely destroyed{1] in the country 100000 were left homeless due to hurricane georges{44] high winds downed power lines trees and telephone poles leaving many in eastern cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm along the coast severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges though eastern cuba was the area most affected the central and western portion of the island including havana experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts{45] there strong waves broke over the seawall and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town's old buildings{46]like in puerto rico and hispaniola the severe drought during the el nixc3xb1o of 1997 exacerbated the flood's disruption to crops in eastern cuba the heavy rainfall from georges damaged the crops greatly despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival up to 70 of the plantain crop a chief food in the country's diet was destroyed the sugarcane crop fared badly as well limiting one of the country's important export crops the coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane further damaging the country's food supply{35]well-executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six{1] while damage amounted to 305xc2xa0million (1998xc2xa0usd 500xc2xa0million 2009xc2xa0usd){14]bahamas{edit]though georges was forecast to move through the bahamas it passed to the south of the archipelago it brought 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) winds to turks and caicos islands and south andros as well as precipitation in the storm's outer bands though damage was minimal one person died in the country{1]united states{edit]see also: hurricane georges tornado outbreakthroughout the mainland areas of the united states georges left approximately 2765xc2xa0billion in damage the hurricane ranked as the country's fifth costliest hurricane at the time of its occurrence but has since fallen to the twentieth costliest due to extensive preparations only one direct death was attributed to the storm a tornado outbreak produced

trees in key west along the old houseboat row on south roosevelt blvdin the florida keys georges brought a storm surge of up to 12xc2xa0ft (36xc2xa0m) in tavernier{8] the islands some only 7xc2xa0ft (2xc2xa0m) high and 300xc2xa0yds (275xc2xa0m) wide flooded easily{9] tides reaching about 10xc2xa0ft (3xc2xa0m) above normal inundated many parts of the overseas highway strong winds downed palm trees and power lines leaving all of the keys without power georges's waves overturned two boats in key west{8] damaged 1536xc2xa0houses and destroyed 173xc2xa0homes many of which were mobile homes rainfall
