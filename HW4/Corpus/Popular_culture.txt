the madeon song see pop culture (song)popular culture or pop culture is the entirety of attitudes ideas images perspectives and other phenomena within the mainstream of a given culture especially western culture of the early to mid-20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century{citation needed] heavily influenced by mass media this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society the most common pop culture categories are: entertainment (such as movies music television and video games) sports news (as in peopleplaces in news) politics fashionclothes technology and slang{1] popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics{2]popular culture is sometimes viewed as being trivial and "dumbed down" in order to find consensual acceptance throughout the mainstream as a result it comes under heavy criticism from various non-mainstream sources (most notably religious groups and countercultural groups) which deem it superficial consumerist sensationalist or corrupt{3]{4]{5]{6]{7]contents1 history and definitions11 folklore2 entertainment21 television programs22 music3 sport4 corporate branding5 see also6 notes7 references8 further reading9 external linkshistory and definitions{edit]see also: cultural historythe term "popular culture" was coined in the 19th century or earlier{8] traditionally popular culture was associated with poor education and the lower classes{9] as opposed to the "official culture" and higher education of the upper classes{10]{11]the stress in the distinction from "official culture" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century{12]{need quotation to verify] a usage that became established by the interbellum period{13]{need quotation to verify]from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption{14] social and cultural changes in the united states were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countriesthe abbreviated form "pop" for popular as in pop music dates from the late 1950s{15] although terms "pop" and "popular" are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term "pop" is narrower pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal while "popular" refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style{16]{17]according to author john storey there are six definitions of popular culture{18] the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much "high culture" (eg television dramatizations of jane austen) is also "popular" "pop culture" is also defined as the culture that is "left over" when we have decided what high culture is however many works straddle the boundaries eg william shakespeare and charles dickensa third definition equates pop culture with "mass culture" and ideas this is seen as a commercial culture mass-produced for mass consumption by mass media{19] from a western european perspective this may be compared to american culture{clarification needed] alternatively "pop culture" can be defined as an "authentic" culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the "people"{pagexc2xa0needed] storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; neo-gramscian hegemony theory " sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society" a postmodernist approach to popular culture would "no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture"storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution studies of shakespeare (by weimann barber or bristol for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the commedia dell'arte for example){20]{21]{need quotation to verify]popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time it forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways for example certain currents of pop culture may originate from (or diverge into) a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the german researcher ronald daus who studies the impact of extra-european cultures in north america asia and especially in latin americafolklore{edit]adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture{22] this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media eg in the form of jokes or urban legend with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurredalthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolvesentertainment{edit]television programs{edit]main article: television programa television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air cable television or internet television other than a commercial trailer or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewershiptelevision programs may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas) or non-fictional (as in documentary news and reality television) it may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television movies) or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series) they could be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows{citation needed]music{edit]main article: popular musicpopular music is music with wide appeal{23]{24] that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry these forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training{23] it stands in contrast to both art music{25]{26] and traditional or "folk" music art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music although since the beginning of the recording industry it is also disseminated through recordings traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally or to smaller local audiences{25]sport{edit]main article: sportsport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which{27] through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators{28]corporate branding{edit]main article: corporate brandingcorporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity as opposed to
