thermodynamics and in mechanics is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat (ie the temperature difference xcex94t):the overall heat transfer by combined modes is usually expressed on terms of an overall conductance or overall heat transfer coefficient 'u'heat transfer q=ua(t2-t1)h=qxcex94t{displaystyle h={frac {q}{delta

temperature between the solid surface and surrounding fluid area kit is used in calculating the heat transfer typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin: w(m2k)the heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance this is used for building materials (r-value) and for clothing insulationthere are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes different fluids flow regimes and under different thermohydraulic conditions often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number (a dimensionless number) there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured (eg <02wcm2{displaystyle <02wcm^{2}}){1]{2]contents1 composition2 convective heat transfer correlations21 external flow vertical plane22 external flow vertical cylinders23

buildings or across heat exchangers is shown below note that this method only accounts for conduction within materials it does not take into account heat transfer through methods such as radiation the method is as follows:1(uxe2x8bx85a)=1(h1xe2x8bx85a1)+dxw(kxe2x8bx85a)+1(h2xe2x8bx85a2){displaystyle 1(ucdot a)=1(h_{1}cdot a_{1})+dx_{w}(kcdot a)+1(h_{2}cdot a_{2})}where:u{displaystyle u} = the overall heat transfer coefficient (w(m2xe2x80xa2k))a{displaystyle a} = the contact area for each fluid side (m2) (with a1{displaystyle a_{1}} and a2{displaystyle a_{2}} expressing either surface)k{displaystyle k} = the thermal conductivity of the material (w(mxc2xb7k))h{displaystyle h} = the individual convection heat transfer coefficient for each fluid (w(m2xe2x80xa2k))dxw{displaystyle dx_{w}} = the wall thickness (m)as the areas for each surface approach being equal the equation can be written as the transfer coefficient per unit area as shown below:1u=1h1+dxwk+1h2{displaystyle 1u=1h_{1}+dx_{w}k+1h_{2}}oru=1(1h1+dxwk+1h2){displaystyle u=1(1h_{1}+dx_{w}k+1h_{2})}it is to be noted that often the value for dxw{displaystyle dx_{w}} is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid however this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zeroin the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components architects and engineers call the resulting values either the u-value or the r-value of a construction assembly like a wall each type of value (r or u) are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value = 1u-value and both are more fully understood through the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient described in lower section of this documentconvective heat transfer correlations{edit]although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis exact analysis of the boundary layer approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable therefore many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow these empirical correlations are presented for their particular geometry and flow conditions as the fluid properties are temperature dependent they are evaluated at the film temperature tf{displaystyle t_{f}} which is the average of the surface ts{displaystyle t_{s}} and the

dittus-bxc3xb6lter correlation (1930) is a common and particularly simple correlation useful for many applications this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer; ie there is no boiling condensation significant radiation etc the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be xc2xb115for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10000 and 120000 (in the turbulent pipe flow range) when the fluid's prandtl number is between 07 and 120 for a location far from the pipe entrance (more than 10 pipe diameters; more than 50 diameters according to many authors{7]) or other flow disturbances and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as:hdk=0023(jdxcexbc)08(xcexbccpk)n{displaystyle {hd over k}={0023}left({jd over mu }right)^{08}left({mu c_{p} over k}right)^{n}}where:d{displaystyle d} is the

equation are evaluated at the bulk temperature thus avoiding iterationforced convection external flow{edit]in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface where x{displaystyle x} is the distance from the edge and l{displaystyle l} is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy{6]thom correlation{edit]there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water (subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa) under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux:{9]xcex94tsat=225xe2x8bx85q05expxe2x81xa1(xe2x88x92p87){displaystyle delta t_{sat}=225cdot {q}^{05}exp(-p87)}where:xcex94tsat{displaystyle delta t_{sat}} is the wall temperature elevation above the saturation temperature kq is the heat flux mwm2p is the pressure of water mpanote that this empirical correlation is specific to the units givenheat transfer coefficient of pipe wall{edit]the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a "heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall" however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curved{citation needed]:hwall=kx{displaystyle h_{wall}={k over x}}where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thicknessif the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression:hwall=2kdilnxe2x81xa1(dodi){displaystyle h_{wall}={2k over {d_{i}ln(d_{o}d_{i})}}}where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectivelythe thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature; the mean thermal conductivity is often usedcombining heat transfer coefficients{edit]for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel heat transfer coefficients simply add:h=h1+h2+xe2x8bxaf{displaystyle h=h_{1}+h_{2}+cdots }for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series heat transfer coefficients add inversely:{10]1h=1h1+1h2+xe2x80xa6{displaystyle {1 over h}={1 over h_{1}}+{1 over h_{2}}+dots }for example consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface is:{11]q=(11h+tk)xe2x8bx85axe2x8bx85xcex94t{displaystyle q=left({1 over {{1 over h}+{t over k}}}right)cdot acdot delta t}whereq = heat

temperatureoverall heat transfer coefficient{edit]the overall heat transfer coefficient u{displaystyle u} is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers but can be applied equally well to other problemsfor the case of a heat exchanger u{displaystyle u} can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship:q=uaxcex94tlm{displaystyle q=uadelta t_{lm}}where:q{displaystyle q} = heat transfer rate (w)u{displaystyle u} = overall heat transfer coefficient (w(mxc2xb2xc2xb7k))a{displaystyle a} = heat transfer surface area (m2)xcex94tlm{displaystyle delta t_{lm}} = logarithmic mean temperature difference (k)the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances (but more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel):1ua=xe2x88x911ha+xe2x88x91r{displaystyle {frac {1}{ua}}=sum {frac {1}{ha}}+sum r}where:r = resistance(s) to heat flow in pipe wall (kw)other parameters are as above{12]the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid sidethe thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship:r=xkxe2x8bx85a{displaystyle r={frac {x}{kcdot a}}}wherex = the wall thickness (m)k = the thermal conductivity of the material (w(mxc2xb7k))a = the total area of the heat exchanger (m2)this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipethe thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivitiesas mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature propertiessome typical heat transfer coefficients include:air - h = 10 to 100 w(m2k)water - h = 500 to 10000 w(m2k)thermal resistance due to fouling deposits{edit]often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance:{13]1ufp{displaystyle {frac {1}{u_{f}p}}} = 1up+rfhph+rfcpc{displaystyle {frac {1}{up}}+{frac {r_{fh}}{p_{h}}}+{frac {r_{fc}}{p_{c}}}}whereuf{displaystyle u_{f}} = overall heat transfer coefficient for a fouled heat exchanger wm2k{displaystyle {frac {w}{m^{2}k}}}p{displaystyle p}= perimeter of the heat exchanger may be either the hot or cold side perimeter however it must be the same perimeter on both sides of the equation m{displaystyle m}u{displaystyle u} = overall heat transfer coefficient for an unfouled heat exchanger wm2k{displaystyle {frac {w}{m^{2}k}}}rfc{displaystyle r_{fc}} = fouling resistance on the cold side of the heat exchanger m2kw{displaystyle {frac {m^{2}k}{w}}}rfh{displaystyle r_{fh}} = fouling resistance on the hot side of the heat exchanger m2kw{displaystyle {frac {m^{2}k}{w}}}pc{displaystyle p_{c}} = perimeter of the cold side of the heat exchanger m{displaystyle m}ph{displaystyle p_{h}} = perimeter of the hot side of the heat exchanger m{displaystyle m}this equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides the perimeter used for the p{displaystyle p} does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product up{displaystyle up} will remain the samethe fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat exchanger{13]rf{displaystyle r_{f}} = dfkf{displaystyle {frac {d_{f}}{k_{f}}}}where:df{displaystyle d_{f}} = average thickness of the fouling in a heat exchanger m{displaystyle m}kf{displaystyle k_{f}} = thermal conductivity of the fouling wmk{displaystyle {frac
