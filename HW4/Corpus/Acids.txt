unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (h+) from an acid to a basehydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions interestingly although alcohols and amines can be brxc3xb8nsted-lowry acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atomsarrhenius acidssvante arrheniusthe swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (h+) or protons in 1884 an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h+ ions in the water{4]{5] note that chemists often write h+(aq) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o+ thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hcl and acetic acidan arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide (ohxe2x88x92) ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules:h3o+(aq) + ohxe2x88x92(aq) xe2x87x8c h2o(l) + h2o(l)due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases itin an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10xe2x88x927 moles per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7brxc3xb8nstedxe2x80x93lowry acidsmain article: brxc3xb8nstedxe2x80x93lowry acidxe2x80x93base theoryacetic acid a weak acid donates a proton (hydrogen ion highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion red: oxygen black: carbon white: hydrogenwhile the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in 1923 chemists johannes nicolaus brxc3xb8nsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton a brxc3xb8nsted-lowry acid (or simply brxc3xb8nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a brxc3xb8nsted-lowry base{5] brxc3xb8nsted-lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid (ch3cooh) the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:ch3cooh + h2o xe2x87x8c ch3cooxe2x88x92 + h3o+ch3cooh + nh3 xe2x87x8c ch3cooxe2x88x92 + nh+4both theories easily describe the first reaction: ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o+ when dissolved in water and it acts as a brxc3xb8nsted acid by donating a proton to water in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia (nh3) but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brxc3xb8nsted-lowry acidbrxc3xb8nsted-lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase hydrogen chloride (hcl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride nh4cl in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius's definition:h3o+(aq) + clxe2x88x92(aq) + nh3 xe2x86x92 clxe2x88x92(aq) + nh+4(aq) + h2ohcl(benzene) + nh3(benzene) xe2x86x92 nh4cl(s)hcl(g) + nh3(g) xe2x86x92 nh4cl(s)as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solidlewis acidsmain article: lewis acids and basesa third only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words it is an electron pair acceptor{5] brxc3xb8nsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not brxc3xb8nsted-lowry acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:in the first reaction a fluoride ion fxe2x88x92 gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate fluoride "loses" a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the bxe2x80x94f bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of brxc3xb8nsted theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a proton is transferred from an unspecified brxc3xb8nsted acid to ammonia a brxc3xb8nsted base; alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid; for example the oxygen atom in h3o+ gains a pair of electrons when one of the hxe2x80x94o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile organic brxc3xb8nsted acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids{4] they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid h+ but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base (acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned) few if any of the acids discussed in the following are lewis acidsdissociation and equilibriumreactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha xe2x87x8c h+ + axe2x88x92 where ha represents the acid and axe2x88x92 is the conjugate base this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form (ha) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid{6]acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation respectively) note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha+ xe2x87x8c h+ + a in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that {h2o] means the concentration of h2o the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid (ha) and the products are the conjugate base and h+ka={h+]{axe2x88x92]{ha]{displaystyle k_{a}={frac {ce {{h+]{a^{-}]}}{ce {{ha]}}}}the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka = xe2x88x92log10 ka stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids experimentally determined pka at 25xc2xa0xc2xb0c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference materialnomenclaturein the classical naming system acids are named according to their anions that ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix) according to the table below for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid in the iupac naming system "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride the iupac name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride the prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other elementclassical naming system:anion prefixanion suffixacid prefixacid suffixexampleperateperic acidperchloric acid (hclo4)ateic acidchloric acid (hclo3)iteous acidchlorous acid (hclo2)hypoitehypoous acidhypochlorous acid (hclo)idehydroic acidhydrochloric acid (hcl)acid strengthmain article: acid strengththe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h+ and one mole of the conjugate base axe2x88x92 and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (hcl) hydroiodic acid (hi) hydrobromic acid (hbr) perchloric acid (hclo4) nitric acid (hno3) and sulfuric acid (h2so4) in water each of these essentially ionizes 100 the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h+ two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the hxe2x80x94a bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the hxe2x80x94a bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate basestronger acids have a larger ka and a more negative pka than weaker acidssulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid) unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterablesuperacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium "salts" they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocationswhile ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's kachemical characteristicsmonoprotic acidsmonoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by ha):ha(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + axe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 kacommon examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (hcl) and nitric acid (hno3) on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid (hcooh) acetic acid (ch3cooh) and benzoic acid (c6h5cooh)see also: acid dissociation constant xc2xa7xc2xa0monoprotic acidspolyprotic acidspolyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate)a diprotic acid (here symbolized by h2a) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2h2a(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + haxe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 ka1haxe2x88x92(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + a2xe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0xc2xa0xc2xa0 xc2xa0 ka2the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; ie ka1 > ka2 for example sulfuric acid (h2so4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (hsoxe2x88x924) for which ka1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (so2xe2x88x924) wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid (h2co3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (hcoxe2x88x923) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (co2xe2x88x923) both ka values are small but ka1 > ka2 a triprotic acid (h3a) can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1 > ka2 > ka3h3a(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + h2axe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 ka1h2axe2x88x92(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + ha2xe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0 xc2xa0 xc2xa0 ka2ha2xe2x88x92(aq) + h2o(l) xe2x87x8c h3o+(aq) + a3xe2x88x92(aq) xc2xa0 xc2xa0xc2xa0xc2xa0xc2xa0xc2xa0 ka3an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (h3po4) usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2poxe2x88x924 then hpo2xe2x88x924 and finally po3xe2x88x924 the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ionalthough the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration xcexb1 (alpha) for each species can be calculated for example a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: h2a haxe2x88x92 and a2xe2x88x92 the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph (which can be converted to the {h+]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:xcexb1h2a={h+]2{h+]2+{h+]k1+k1k2={h2a]{h2a]+{haxe2x88x92]+{a2xe2x88x92]xcexb1haxe2x88x92={h+]k1{h+]2+{h+]k1+k1k2={haxe2x88x92]{h2a]+{haxe2x88x92]+{a2xe2x88x92]xcexb1a2xe2x88x92=k1k2{h+]2+{h+]k1+k1k2={a2xe2x88x92]{h2a]+{haxe2x88x92]+{a2xe2x88x92]{displaystyle {egin{aligned}alpha _{ce {h2a}}={frac {ce {{h+]^{2}}}{{ce {{h+]^{2}}}+{{ce {h+}}]k_{1}+k_{1}k_{2}}}={frac {ce {{h2a]}}{ce {{{h2a]}+{{ha^{-}]}+{{a^{2-}]}}}}alpha _{ce {ha^{-}}}={frac {{{ce {h+}}]k_{1}}{{ce {{h+]^{2}}}+{{ce {h+}}]k_{1}+k_{1}k_{2}}}={frac {ce {{ha^{-}]}}{ce {{{h2a]}+{{ha^{-}]}+{{a^{2-}]}}}}alpha _{ce {a^{2-}}}={frac {k_{1}k_{2}}{{ce {{h+]^{2}}}+{{ce {h+}}]k_{1}+k_{1}k_{2}}}={frac {ce {{a^{2-}]}}{ce {{{h2a]}+{{ha^{-}]}+{{a^{2-}]}}}}end{aligned}}}a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a bjerrum plot a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n -protic acid that has been deprotonated i -times:xcexb1hnxe2x88x92iaixe2x88x92={h+]nxe2x88x92ixe2x88x8fj=0ikjxe2x88x91i=0n{{h+]nxe2x88x92ixe2x88x8fj=0ikj]{displaystyle alpha _{{ce {h}}_{n-i}a^{i-}}={{{{ce {h+}}]^{n-i}displaystyle prod _{j=0}^{i}k_{j}} over {displaystyle sum _{i=0}^{n}{ig {}{{ce {h+}}]^{n-i}displaystyle prod _{j=0}^{i}k_{j}}{ig ]}}}where k0 = 1 and the other k-terms are the dissociation constants for the acidsee also: acid dissociation constant xc2xa7xc2xa0polyprotic acidsneutralizationhydrochloric acid (in beaker) reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride (white smoke)neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt and neutralized base;
