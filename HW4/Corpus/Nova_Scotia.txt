winters are still cold enough to be classified as continentalxe2x80x94still being nearer the freezing point than inland areas to the west the nova scotian climate is in many ways similar to the central baltic sea coast in northern europe only wetter and snowier this is in spite of nova scotia being some fifteen parallels south areas not on the atlantic coast experience warmer summers more

scotia at the time the first european colonists arrived{13] in 1605 french colonists established the first permanent european settlement in the future canada (and the first north of florida) at port royal founding what would become known as acadia{14]{15]the british conquest of acadia took place in 1710 the treaty of utrecht in 1713 formally recognized this and returned cape breton island (xc3x8ele royale) to the french present-day new brunswick then still formed a part of the french colony of acadia the british changed{when?] the name of the capital from port royal to annapolis royal in 1749 the capital of nova scotia moved from annapolis royal to the newly established halifax in 1755 the vast majority of the french population (the acadians) were forcibly removed in the expulsion of the acadians; new england planters arrived between 1759 and 1768 to replace themport royal annapolis county nova scotia situated on the annapolis river where it widens to form the annapolis basinin 1763 most of acadia (cape breton island st john's island (now prince edward island) and new brunswick) became part of nova scotia in 1769 st john's island became a separate colony nova scotia included present-day new brunswick until that province's establishment in 1784 after the arrival of united empire loyalists{16] in 1867 nova scotia became one of the four founding provinces of the canadian confederation{17]17th and 18th centuries{edit]fort edward xe2x80x93 the oldest blockhouse in north america (1750)a view of louisburg in north america november 11 1762the warfare on nova scotian soil

catholic mi'kmaq and acadians formed the majority of the population of the colony for the next 150 years during the first 80 years the french and acadians lived in nova scotia nine significant military clashes took place as the english and scottish (later british) dutch and french fought for possession of the area these encounters happened at port royal saint john{19] cap de sable

treaties with great britain beginning after father rale's war (1725) in 1725 the british signed a treaty (or "agreement") with the mi'kmaq but the authorities{which?] have often disputed its definition of the rights of the mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands{20]{21]monument at millbrook near truro nova scotia paying tribute to glooscap--a legendary figure to mi'kmaq people of nova

14th american colony" as some called itxe2x80x94displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of britain and rebellion flared at the battle of fort cumberland (1776) and at the siege of saint john (1777) throughout the war american privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of halifax these american raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral nova scotians into supporting the british by the end of the war nova scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack american shipping{26] british military forces based at halifax succeeded in preventing american support for rebels in nova scotia and deterred any invasion of nova scotia however the british navy failed to establish naval supremacy while the british captured many american privateers in battles such as the naval battle off halifax (1782) many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war the royal navy struggled to maintain british supply lines defending convoys from american and french attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle the naval battle off cape breton (1781)an interpretive sign along the heritage trail at the black loyalist heritage society's birchtown museumafter the thirteen colonies and their french allies forced the british forces to surrender (1781) approximately 33000 tories or loyalists (the king's loyal americans allowed to place "united empire loyalist" after their names) settled in nova scotia (14000 of them in what became new brunswick) on lands granted by the crown as some compensation for their losses (the british administration divided nova scotia and carved out the present-day province of new brunswick in 1784) the loyalist exodus created new communities across nova scotia including shelburne which briefly became one of the larger british settlements in north america and infused nova scotia with additional capital and skills however the migration also caused political tensions between loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing new england planters settlement the loyalist influx also pushed nova scotia's mi'kmaq people to the margins as loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands as part of the loyalist migration about 3000 black loyalists arrived; they founded the largest free black settlement in north america at birchtown near shelburne however unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused about one-third of the black loyalists to resettle in sierra leone in 1792 where they founded freetown and became known in africa as the nova scotian settlers19th century{edit]statue of joseph howe province house created by famed quebec sculptor louis-philippe hxc3xa9bertduring

capita gdp in 2010 was 38475 significantly lower than the national average per capita gdp of 47605 and a little more than half of canada's richest province alberta gdp growth has lagged behind the rest of the country for at least the past decade{41]nova scotia's traditionally resource-based economy has diversified in recent decades the rise of nova scotia as a viable jurisdiction in north america historically was driven by the ready availability of natural resources especially the fish stocks off the scotian shelf the fishery was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of new france in the 17th century; however the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century the collapse of the cod stocks and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20000 jobs in 1992{42] other sectors in the province were also hit hard particularly during the last two decades: coal mining in cape breton and northern mainland nova scotia has virtually ceased production and a large steel mill in sydney closed during the 1990s more recently the high value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has hurt the forestry industry leading to the shut down of a long-running pulp and paper mill near liverpool mining especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica peat and barite is also a significant sector{43] since 1991 offshore oil and gas has become an increasingly important part of the economy although production and revenue are now declining{41] agriculture remains an important sector in the province particularly in the annapolis valleynova scotiaxe2x80x99s defence and aerospace sector generates approximately 500 million in revenues and contributes about 15 billion to the provincial economy
