planetary origins; and planetary detection studies of the earth are included when they concern exogenic effects or the comparison of the earth to other planetsf: earth surface focuses on the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the form and function of the surface of the solid earth over all temporal and spatial scales including fluvial eolian and coastal sediment transport; hillslope mass movements; glacial and periglacial activity; weathering and pedogenesis; and surface manifestations of volcanism and tectonismg: biogeosciences focuses on the interface between biology and the geosciences and attempts to understand the functions of the earth system across multiple spatial and temporal scaleseach of the sections has one or more editors who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president of the american geophysical union for terms of three to four years each editor can in turn appoint associate editors{7]according to the editor-in-chief of jgr-space physics "with the switch to wiley the separate sections of jgr were given distinct issn numbers this means that in a couple of years each section of jgr will have its own impact factor"{8]abstracting and indexing{edit]the journal is indexed by geobase georef scopus pubmed web of science and several csa indexes{9] it published 2995 articles in 2010 according to the journal citation reports the journal has a 2010 impact factor of 3303 ranking it 15th out of 165 journals in the category "geosciences multidisciplinary" journal of geophysical researchxe2x80x94atmospheres was also the 6th most cited publication on climate change between 1999 and 2009{10]notable articles{edit]among the most highly cited papers in the journal of geophysical research (with over 1000 citations each) are:{11]cande d v;
