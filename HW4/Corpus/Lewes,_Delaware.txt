first european settlement in delaware a whaling and trading post that dutch settlers founded on june 3 1631 and named zwaanendael (swan valley){7] the colony had a short existence as a local tribe of lenape native americans wiped out the 32 settlers in 1632the area remained rather neglected by the dutch until under the threat of annexation from the english colony of maryland the city of amsterdam made a grant of land at the hoernkills (the area around cape henlopen near the current town of lewes) to a group of mennonites for settlement in 1662 a total of 35 men were to be included in the settlement led by a pieter cornelisz plockhoy of zierikzee and funded by a sizable loan from the city to get them established the settlement was established in 1663 but the timing of the settlement was terrible: in 1664 the english wrested new netherland from the dutch and they had the settlement destroyed with british reports indicating that xe2x80x9cnot even a nailxe2x80x9d was left there{8]the area was slow to resettle but a new settlement gradually regrew around the hoernkills in late december 1673 when the area was briefly held again by the dutch the settlement was attacked and burned down again by soldiers from the english colony of maryland in 1680 under the authority of james stuart duke of york who had been granted such authority by his brother king charles ii the village (and county) was reorganized and known for two years as new deale deale county delaware a log courthouse was authorized to be built at this time a church of england congregation was established by 1681 and a presbyterian church was built in 1682in 1682 the delaware colonies were given to william penn by english king charles ii in payment of a family debt when penn arrived in the new world later that year he renamed the county as sussex and the hoernkills settlement as lewes in commemoration of sites back in england lewes became and remained the county seat of sussex county until 1791 when it was moved to a more west-central county location the current town of georgetown{9]on april 5 and 6 1813 during the war of 1812 british naval vessels led by hms poictiers under the command of captain sir john beresford briefly and ineffectually bombarded the town a cannonball from the bombardment is lodged in the foundation of cannonball house which now serves as the town's maritime museumlewes was incorporated by an act of the state assembly on feb 2 1818 the act provided for five persons to be chosen as commissioners to be known as "trustees of the town of lewes" {10] {11]lewes beach itself was an important stop on the underground railroad in the years leading up to the american civil war as a "border state" delaware was not part of the confederacy but was still quite dangerous for fugitive slaves several houses in lewes thus housed escaping slaves; these "safe houses" were identified by the residents placing a single candle in the top window of the house {1]in 1941 the united states built fort miles on cape henlopen immediately south of lewes to defend delaware bay and the delaware river and the oil refineries and factories on its shores as well as the city of philadelphia it was one of the largest and most heavily armed coastal fortifications ever built{citation needed]fort miles never saw any major action; except for range practice it fired its guns only once between its establishment and the end of world war ii fort miles ceased operation altogether in 1991 and was deeded to the state of delawarelightship overfalls preserved as a
