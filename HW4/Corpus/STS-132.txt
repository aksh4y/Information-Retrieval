modulests-132 carried the russian rassvet mini-research module 1 to the international space station{11] rassvet means "dawn" in russian the module was built by russian aerospace company energia{12] rassvet arrived at the kennedy space center (ksc) aboard an antonov 124 cargo plane on 17 december 2009 at about 13:00 est{13] after it was unloaded from the antonov the module was transported to an astrotech processing bay in cape canaveral to undergo preparations for launchan airlock and radiation heat exchanger to be used for outfitting the russian nauka module (to be launched in 2012) a spare elbow part of the european robotic arm (era) and a portable work platform for science hardware for performing experiments in outer space were externally mounted on rassvet in its launch configuration{14] russian and us cargo to be delivered will also be accommodated inside the module the volume for cargo and science inside mrm1 is 5 cubic meters{15] rassvet was outfitted with iss standard grapple fixtures that allowed the module to be unloaded from the payload bay of atlantis using the station's robotic armintegrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable (icc-vld2){edit]icc-vld2 launch and return configurationsalso on board atlantis was the integrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable (icc-vld2) pallet holding a ku-band space to ground antenna (sgant) the sgant boom assembly an enhanced orbital replacement unit (oru) temporary platform (eotp) for the canadian dextre robotic arm extension video and power grapple fixtures (pvgf) and six new battery orus the six new batteries replaced older ones on the p6 truss of the iss the old batteries were placed on the icc-vld pallet for return to earth the eotp was built by macdonald dettwiler and associates ltd (mda) of brampton ontario canada for nasa{16]the icc pallet is constructed of aluminum it is approximately 8 feet (24xc2xa0m) long 13 feet (40xc2xa0m) wide and 10xc2xa0inches thick the empty weight of the pallet is 2645 pounds the total weight of iccxe2x80x93vld and the orus is approximately 8330 pounds icc-vld return mass is 2933 kilograms (6466xc2xa0lb)the icc-vld was berthed in the center of the shuttle's payload bay for both launch and reentry{17]other items{edit]in addition to the standard official flight kit (ofk) flown inside a locker on the mid-deck two light weight tool stowage assemblies were modified to fly memorabilia and then were stowed to the left and right of atlantis' airlock in the shuttle's payload bay{18]a compact disk (cd) containing the digital copies of all entries submitted to nasa's space shuttle program commemorative patch contest{19] was also flown aboard atlantis{20] the contest was organized by the space shuttle program to mark the end of the shuttle era the winning patch was designed by mr blake dumesnil of hamilton sundstrand johnson space center{21] a panel of nasa judges including shuttle program manager john shannon leroy cain and three other shuttle program managers including former astronaut john casper selected the winning patch from a pool of 85 entries by nasa employees and contractorsseventeen handcrafted beads made by nine different artists across north america were also on board atlantis during the sts-132 mission{22]{23] nasa teamed up with beads of courage inc an approved public charity to bring hope and inspiration to children coping with serious illnesses through the beads in space project the beads in space project is the brainchild of jamie newton an employee at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the 17 beads weigh eight ounces and were selected after a contest organized by beads of courage that attracted 54 beadsalso on board atlantis was a 4-inch long wood sample of sir isaac newton's apple tree{24] the piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired newton's theory of gravity along with a picture of newton were taken into orbit by astronaut piers sellers the wood is part of the collection of the royal society archives in london and was returned there following the flight{25]additionally a flag from clarkson university potsdam new york flew on board shuttle atlantis{26] it was there in honor of sts-132 lead shuttle flight director michael l sarafin who is an alumnus of the clarkson universitya comprehensive list of sts-132 items that were carried aboard atlantis and their descriptions can be found in the official flight kit{27]mrm 1 in the space station processing facility (sspf) at kennedy space centermrm 1 in the astrotech payload processing

mission 150 people attended the event from more than 30 us states the district of columbia puerto rico belgium the netherlands new zealand and the united kingdom the tweetup participants met with shuttle technicians managers engineers and astronauts took a tour of the kennedy space center and viewed the launch of atlantis{28]mission experiments{edit]atlantis crew worked with several short-term experiments during their mission the shuttle transported new long-term experiments to the iss at the end of the mission atlantis returned some of the completed experiments from the issshort-term experiments included:micro-2: researchers from rensselaer polytechnic institute sent microorganisms to investigate new ways of preventing the formation and spread of clusters of bacteria (biofilms) that could pose a threat to the health of astronauts{29] after the shuttle landed the resulting biofilms were examined to see how their growth and development were impacted by microgravityhypersole: hypersole is a canadian research project that plans to investigate sudden changes in skin sensitivity experienced by some astronauts in space{30] the researchers hope to understand more about how the skin sensitivity of the soles of the feet affect the human balance three sts-132 crew members participated in identical trials before the launch and immediately upon landing the trials were also repeated on five astronauts scheduled to fly on the sts-133 and sts-134 missions project findings are expected to add significant knowledge to existing studies of aging and to be beneficial for the elderly and people who suffer from balance problemsshuttle ionospheric modification with pulsed localized exhaust experiments (simplex) xe2x80x93 sts-132 crew performed the simplex burn on flight day 12 the experiment investigates plasma turbulence driven by shuttle exhaust in the ionosphere using ground-based radars{31] the processes by which chemical releases can produce plasma turbulence are quantified with the simplex measurements plasma turbulence can affect military navigation and communications using radio systems they can also be used to promote communications by opening radio channels at abnormally high frequenciesshuttle processing{edit]the mission's external tank et-136 began its 900-mile (1400xc2xa0km) six-day journey across the gulf of mexico from nasa's michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana on 24 february 2010{32]{33] et-136 measured 154 feet (47xc2xa0m) long and 28 feet (85xc2xa0m) in diameter the solid rocket booster retrieval ship liberty star towed the et in the enclosed barge pegasus after docking in the turn basin at the kennedy space center the tank was offloaded and driven to the vehicle assembly building (vab) on 1 march 2010{34]on 29 march 2010 workers attached et-136 to its solid rocket boosters a crane lifted the et into high bay no 1 inside the vab the day-long process was completed around 18:00 edt as the tank was bolted to atlantis's twin solid rocket boosters{35]atlantis rolled out of its processing bay (opf-1) around 07:00 edt on 13 april 2010 the shuttle entered the vab around 11:00 edt for attachment to its external tank and solid rocket boosters{36] given that this was at the time believed to be atlantis' final rollover for a mission the shuttle stopped for several hours en route to the vab allowing engineers and technicians to pose for photographs with the orbiter{37] the rollover occurred exactly 25 years after atlantis first arrived at the kennedy space center after a cross-country trip from the shuttle factory in palmdale california{38] the path to the rollover was without any incidents of major concern with only 22 interim problem reports (iprs) noted during atlantis' flow since its return from the sts-129 mission in november 2009the transport canister containing the sts-132 payload arrived at pad 39a on 15 april 2010 ahead of atlantis' rollover to the launch pad{39] the canister was shaped like the shuttle's 60-foot (18xc2xa0m)-long payload bay packed inside it were the mrm-1 module and the cargo-carrying pallet icc-vldspace shuttle atlantis began its rollout to launch pad 39a at 23:31 edt on 21 april 2010{40] the complete shuttle stack and mobile launch platform were secured to the launch pad's structure at 6:03 edt on 22 april 2010 the 34xc2xa0mi (55 kilometres (34xc2xa0mi)) trek took 6 hours and 32 minutes to complete the rollout was originally planned for the evening of 19 april 2010 but wet weather and thunderstorms on the space coast caused several delays{41]{42]sts-132's payload was installed in the shuttle's cargo bay on 25 april 2010{43]pad engineers preparing atlantis had noticed paint peeling from shuttle's main payload the mrm-1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of mrm-1 it holds a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit{44] engineers also noted mrm-1 cycled its fire and smoke detector self test several times similar events occurred during atlantis' sts-129 mission in november 2009 when shuttle and station crew were awakened consecutive nights by false depressurization and fire alarms that originated from the mrm-2 (poisk) modulean agency-wide flight readiness review (frr) was held at ksc in florida on 5 may 2010 to discuss atlantis' launch preparations at the end of the review top nasa managers made the decision to officially set the launch for 14 may 2010 at 14:20 edt{45]{46] nasa held a post news conference to brief about the results of the frr the briefing was broadcast on nasa tv and was attended by nasa's associate administrator for space operations william gerstenmaier space shuttle program manager john shannon and space shuttle launch director michael leinbach mr shannon mentioned that firstly ceramic inserts around atlantis' windows and forward rocket pod were tested after an insert loosened during discovery's re-entry on sts-131 posing a potential impact threat the inserts had been re-installed on to atlantis using a thicker braided cord to reduce the chances of a backing out secondly it was mentioned that engineers had reviewed work to confirm that all systems on atlantis' ku band antenna were in place the testing had been provoked after the failure of that communication system during sts-131 mr leinbach also acknowledged the skills and experience of the engineering teams and thanked the engineers who had successfully resolved hypergolic loading issues{47] hypergolics are chemicals that ignite when they come in contact with each other the propellants are used in the reaction control system that steers the shuttle in spacea booster rocket segment that had first flown 25 years before on atlantis' maiden flight (sts-51-j) was used to help fly sts-132{48] the aft dome on the left solid rocket booster that lifted off to support atlantis' sts-132 mission first launched sts-51-j on 3 october 1985 including sts-132 18 of atlantis' 32 flights were represented by the boosters' segmentslaunch preparations{edit]atlantis' astronauts traveled from johnson space center houston to the ksc launch site on 10 may 2010 to prepare for the launch the crew arriving in four northrop t-38 talon jets landed on the shuttle landing facility around 18:49 edt{49]the official countdown to liftoff started on 11 may 2010 after the countdown clocks at ksc were activated at 16:00 edt ticking backward from the t-43 hour markprogram managers completed the l-2 mission management team (mmt) meeting on 12 may 2010{50] at the end of the 18-minute-long meeting management team officially cleared atlantis for launch nasa held a pre-launch news conference to reveal the outcomes of the mmt and to brief the press on the upcoming launch the news conference was attended by chair pre-launch mission management team mike moses mike leinbach and sts-132 weather officer todd mcnamara the weather officer spoke of a favorable launch weather forecast due to a high pressure weather pattern and despite a low cloud ceiling calling a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time he further elaborated on the predicted weather conditions at the transoceanic abort landing (tal) sites: zaragoza and moron in spain and istres france in case of an emergencythe space shuttle program mmt met at 04:15 edt on 14 may 2010 and gave a go to begin loading atlantis' et with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen the fuel tanking operation began on time at 04:55 edt and was completed within three hours at 07:56 edt with replenishment fuel being added throughout the countdowncrew preparations for the launch day began at 05:00 edt following an eight-hour overnight sleep an hour later they completed their final medical check ups crew suiting began around 10:00 edt and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10:30 edt at around 11:00 edt first commander ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat followed by pilot antonelli mission specialists bowen sellers reisman and good in order inside the orbiter all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly with all astronauts on board atlantis' hatch was closed and latched for the flight inside the white room the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the padlaunch day countdown procedures went without any major problems; however atlantis encountered two minor issues the final inspection team looking for ice and frost buildup on the et had spotted a small stress fracture on an umbilical strut later during the post-launch news conference the chair of nasa's pre-launch mission management team mike moses said that this was not unusual engineers also resolved any concerns about a loose ball bearing found near the shuttle's payload bay days earlier the bearing was determined to likely be from a camera system and was ultimately ruled out as a concernmission timeline{edit]14 may (flight day 1 xe2x80x93 launch){edit]play mediathe space shuttle external tank falls away (1 min 16 secs)play medialaunch video (9

saying that the shuttle was "reaching the crest of its historic achievements in space" powered flight conformed to the standard timeline with main engine cutoff (meco) occurring at 8 minutes and 32 seconds mission elapsed time (met) the external tank et-136 separated from the shuttle 15 seconds later at 8:47 met{53] a further boost from the orbital maneuvering system (oms) engines was not required due to the nominal meco and atlantis settled into its planned preliminary orbit a subsequent nc-1 engine firing of about 26 seconds adjusted the orbital path of the shuttle to match that of the international space station (iss) by altering the shuttle's velocity by about 41xc2xa0fts (12xc2xa0ms)nasa held a post-launch news conference with bill gerstenmaier alexey krasnov (chief of the piloted programs directorate at the russian federal space agency) mike moses and mike leinbach during the conference gerstenmaier made mention of a piece of space junk that could potentially have impacted atlantis' planned arrival at the iss{54]more than 39000 guests including television host david letterman ex-apollo astronaut buzz aldrin and former nasa administrator michael griffin witnessed the launch{55] the russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the head of the russian space federal agency anatoly perminov were also present at ksc{56]once in orbit the crew opened the shuttle's payload bay doors activated the radiators and deployed the ku band antenna successfully they also completed a checkout of the orbiter's shuttle remote manipulator system (srms) the crew was also successful in downlinking all imagery from atlantis' umbilical well cameras along with crew video of et-136 for review by imagery experts in the ground{57] preliminary inspections showed that et-136 was very clean and had performed well during the ascent with only a few foam liberation incidents visibleit is worth noting that the launch of atlantis on sts-132 was supposed to be its last the mission patch depicted atlantis flying into the sunset as she retired and the space shuttle program patches on sale at the kennedy space center for the launch showed the years 1981xe2x80x932010 for the program the programme guide magazine to the launch also cited the launch as the final flight of space shuttle atlantis however on its return atlantis was readied as a rescue shuttle for the (at that time) two remaining missions of sts-133 and sts-134 it could be launched on need if there was a problem and if not it would be stood down then later in 2010 nasa decided to fly the previously provision sts-135 mission and chose atlantis for the flight given that discover and endeavour were earmarked for sts-133 and sts-134 respectively the funding was found and a decision was taken to fly sts-135 as the final space shuttle mission with atlantis as the orbiter the sts-135 mission launched in july 2011 just over a year after atlantis's launch on the sts-132 mission15 may (flight day 2 xe2x80x93 tps survey){edit]atlantis' cargo bay and its vertical stabilizerthe crew members aboard atlantis began their first full day in space at 08:20 utc{58] the day was primarily devoted to inspecting atlantis's thermal protection system using the shuttle's robotic arm and the orbiter boom sensor system (obss) to look for any signs of launch damage before the thermal protection checkout began the crew encountered a problem with the laser dynamic range imager (ldri) and the intensified tv camera (itvc) due to a snagged cable in that system's pan and tilt unit{59] as a result mission control decided to switch to the less-capable backup sensor system: sensor package 2 a laser camera and a digital camera mounted near the end of the obss sensor package 2 required an additional light source (such as daylight) had a resolution of a few millimeters and could scan at about 25xc2xa0inches per second{60] the crew followed "late inspection" procedures for surveying and images of the right wing the nose cap and much of the left wing were sent to the ground for detailed analysiscommander kenneth ham installed the center-line camera in the orbiter docking system (ods) to help him during atlantis' approach to the iss down on the shuttle's middeck good and bowen spent several hours checking out spacesuits and preparing them for transfer to the station reisman spent much of his day working with antonelli and ham on the tps survey he also assisted with the suit and spacewalk equipment checkouts the crew furthermore performed the ods ring extension that would connect the shuttle's docking port to the station's harmony module the last portion of the crew's day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools to be used during the rendezvoustwo course correction burns were also performed on flight day 2 the first 10-second burn dubbed nc-2 was performed using the right-hand oms engine changing the shuttle's speed by 8xc2xa0fts (24xc2xa0ms) the burn raised both the apogee and perigee of the shuttle's orbit by 1-mile (16xc2xa0km) atlantis' reaction control jets were again fired for a second time to execute the 8-second nc-3 burn which changed the shuttle's velocity by about 2xc2xa0fts (061xc2xa0ms)meanwhile mission control managers determined that the iss would not need an avoidance maneuver to avoid a piece of orbital debris updated tracking

1-minute-24-second-long orbit raising maneuver or nh burn changed atlantis' velocity by 132 feet per second and placed the shuttle into a new 212-by-145 miles (233xc2xa0km) orbit a 63-second circularization burn known as nc4 boosted atlantis into a 214-by-210-mile (340xc2xa0km) orbit at 11:40 utc with about 9 miles (14xc2xa0km) separating the shuttle and the iss commander ken ham performed the final 12-second terminal initiation (ti) burn firing the left oms engine of atlantisby 13:26 utc with ken ham flying the shuttle from the aft flight deck atlantis positioned itself

docked with the iss pressurized mating adapter-2 at 14:28 utc as the two orbited 220 miles (350xc2xa0km) over the south pacific ocean{63]{64] after docking the iss was reoriented by the small vernier thrusters on atlantis to minimize the risk of micro-meteoroid orbital debris (mmod) impacts upon the shuttle a series of leak checks were done on both sides of the hatch by the shuttle and station crews before the hatches were opened at 16:18 utc{65] after a brief welcoming ceremony by the station crew atlantis' astronauts received the standard station safety briefing the crew then got to work with initial transfers of equipment and supplies spacesuits were among the first items to go to the iss station crew member noguchi also transferred high-priority jaxa experiments to the kibo

station flight engineer caldwell dyson operated the robotic arm{68] throughout eva 1 commander ken ham oversaw the extravehicular activitiesduring the spacewalk several problems were encountered{69] the first of which was during installation of the sgant a slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole the spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher torque setting which managed to close the gap to a smaller width the launch locks were left on the sgant to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable or if more troubleshooting would be
