infrared (body-temperature thermal) lightthis infrared space telescope image has (false color) blue green and red corresponding to 34 46 and 12xc2xa0xc2xb5m wavelengths respectivelyinfrared radiation or simply infrared or ir is electromagnetic radiation (emr) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light and is therefore invisible although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light it extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430xc2xa0thz) to 1xc2xa0millimeter (300xc2xa0ghz){1] (although specially pulsed lasers can allow humans to detect ir radiation up to 1050 nm{2]{3]{4]{5]) most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared like all emr ir carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle the photoninfrared was discovered in 1800 by astronomer sir william herschel who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light by means of its effect on a thermometer{6] slightly more than half of the total energy from the sun was eventually found to arrive on earth in the form of infrared the balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on earth's climateinfrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements it excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range{7]infrared radiation is used in industrial scientific and medical applications night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds detect objects such as planets and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe{8] infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems to observe changing blood

general objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object in accordance with wien's displacement

response of various detectors:{17]near-infrared: from 07 to 10xc2xa0xc2xb5m (from the approximate end of the response of the human eye to that of silicon)short-wave infrared: 10 to 3xc2xa0xc2xb5m (from the cut-off of silicon to that of the mwir atmospheric window) ingaas covers to about 18xc2xa0xc2xb5m; the less sensitive lead salts cover this regionmid-wave infrared: 3 to 5xc2xa0xc2xb5m (defined by the atmospheric window and covered by indium antimonide {insb] and hgcdte and partially by lead selenide {pbse])long-wave infrared: 8 to 12 or 7 to 14xc2xa0xc2xb5m (this is the atmospheric window covered by hgcdte and microbolometers)very-long wave infrared (vlwir) (12 to about 30xc2xa0xc2xb5m covered by doped silicon)near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks vs bands water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1050xc2xa0nm while ingaas's sensitivity starts around 950xc2xa0nm and ends between 1700 and 2600xc2xa0nm depending on the specific configuration) no international standards for these specifications are currently availablethe onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700xc2xa0nm and 800xc2xa0nm but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700xc2xa0nm wavelength so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources however particularly intense near-ir light (eg from ir lasers ir led sources or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780xc2xa0nm and will be perceived as red light intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050xc2xa0nm can be seen as a dull red glow causing some difficulty in near-ir illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination) leaves are particularly bright in the near ir and if all visible light leaks from around an ir-filter are blocked and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir-passing photographic filter it is possible to see the wood effect that consists of ir-glowing foliage{18]telecommunication bands in the infrared{edit]in optical communications the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmittingabsorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:{19]banddescriptorwavelength rangeo

well established technology and are not as widely deployedheat{edit]main article: thermal radiationmaterials with higher emissivity appear to be hotter in this thermal image the ceramic cylinder appears to be hotter than its cubic container (made of silicon carbide) while in fact they have the same temperatureinfrared radiation is popularly known as "heat radiation"{citation needed] but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them infrared light from the sun accounts for 49{20] of the heating of earth with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25xc2xa0xc2xb5m band but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects (see black body and wien's displacement law){21]heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared extending into visible ultraviolet and even x-ray regions (eg the solar corona) thus the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet earththe concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body to further explain two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity for example for any pre-set emissivity value objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler for that reason incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometersapplications{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to

visionxc2xa0: the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the human eye despite a dark back-lit scene active-infrared night vision delivers identifying details as seen on the display monitorinfrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see{22] night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light{22] infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source{22]the use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation (heat) that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment{23]thermography{edit]thermography helped to determine the temperature profile of the space shuttle thermal protection system during re-entrymain article: thermographyinfrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects (if the emissivity is known) this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production coststhermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900xe2x80x9314000 nanometers or 09xe2x80x9314xc2xa0xcexbcm) and produce images of that radiation since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures according to the black body radiation law thermography makes it possible to "see" one's environment with or without visible illumination the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name)hyperspectral imaging{edit]main article: hyperspectral imaginghyperspectral thermal infrared emission measurement an outdoor scan in winter conditions ambient temperature xe2x88x9215xc2xa0xc2xb0c

hyperspectral image is a "picture" containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with nir swir mwir and lwir spectral regions typical applications include biological mineralogical defence and industrial measurementsthermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full lwir spectrum consequently chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements outdoor surveillance and uav applications{25]other imaging{edit]in infrared photography infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum digital cameras often use infrared blockers cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can "see" intense near-infrared appearing as a bright purple-white color this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near ir-bright areas (such as near a lamp) where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image there is also a technique called 't-ray' imaging which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques recently t-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopyreflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changestracking{edit]main article: infrared hominginfrared tracking also known as infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers" since infrared (ir) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies many objects such as people vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat and as such are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background{26]heating{edit]main article: infrared heatingthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (november 2013) (learn how and when to remove this template message)infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source for example it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants it may also be used in other heating applications such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing){27] infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque absorbent objects rather than the air around theminfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes eg curing of coatings forming of plastics annealing plastic welding and print drying in these applications infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heatingefficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the materialcooling{edit]main article: radiative coolinga variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems the lwir (8xe2x80x9315 xc2xb5m) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmospherecommunications{edit]ir data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants these devices usually conform to standards published by irda the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (leds) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam the beam is modulated ie switched on and off to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting) the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances infrared remote control protocols like rc-5 sirc are used to communicate with infraredfree space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabits compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable except for the radiation damage "since the eye cannot detect ir blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen"{28]infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems infrared light with a wavelength around 1330xc2xa0nm (least dispersion) or 1550xc2xa0nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard silica fibersir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the rias (remote infrared audible signage) project transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beamingspectroscopy{edit]infrared vibrational spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond a group of atoms in a molecule (eg ch2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole if an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light typically the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000xe2x80x93400xc2xa0cmxe2x88x921 the mid-infrared a spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example a wet sample will show a broad o-h absorption around 3200xc2xa0cmxe2x88x921)thin film metrology{edit]in the semiconductor industry infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer the index of refraction (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer dispersion equations the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension depth and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structuresmeteorology{edit]ir satellite picture taken 1315 z on 15th october 2006 a frontal system can be seen in the gulf of mexico with embedded cumulonimbus cloud shallower cumulus and stratocumulus can be seen off the eastern seaboardweather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types to calculate land and surface water temperatures and to locate ocean surface features the scanning is typically in the range 103xe2x80x93125xc2xa0xc2xb5m (ir4 and ir5 channels)high cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black one disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up however using the difference in brightness of the ir4 channel (103xe2x80x93115xc2xa0xc2xb5m) and the near-infrared channel (158xe2x80x93164xc2xa0xc2xb5m) low cloud can be distinguished producing a fog satellite picture the main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studiedthese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the gulf stream which are valuable to the shipping industry fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea even el nixc3xb1o phenomena can be spotted using color-digitized techniques the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired informationthe main water vapour

radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere these trends provide information on long-term changes in earth's climate it is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming together with solar radiationschematic of the greenhouse effecta pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor

objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components including mirrors lenses and solid state digital detectors for this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy to form an image the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources and the detectors are chilled using liquid heliumthe sensitivity of earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomythe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers cold dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected (in the visible light spectrum the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet)infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies which are often cloaked in gas and dust distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths so they are more readily observed in the infrared{8]infrared cleaning{edit]infrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red green and blue) the infrared channel in combination with the other channels is used to detect the location of scratches and dust once located those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting{29]art conservation and analysis{edit]the arnolfini portrait by jan van eyck national gallery londoninfrared reflectographyxc2xa0(fr; it; es) as called by art conservators{30] can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide this often reveals the artist's use of carbon black which shows up well in reflectograms as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between xe2x80x93 such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist this is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work in general the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version it also gives useful insights into working practices{31]among many other changes in the arnolfini portrait of 1434 (left) the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher and her eyes looked more to the front each of his feet was underdrawn in one position painted in another and then overpainted in a third these alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms{32]recent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the artist{33] notable examples are picasso's "woman ironing" and "blue room" where in both cases a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known todaysimilar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects especially very old written documents such as the dead sea scrolls the roman works in the villa of the papyri and the silk road texts found in the dunhuang caves{34] carbon black used in ink can show up extremely wellbiological systems{edit]main article: infrared sensing in snakesthermographic image of a snake eating a mousethe pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head there is uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection system{35]{36]other organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons (family pythonidae) some boas (family boidae) the common vampire bat (desmodus rotundus) a variety of jewel beetles (melanophila acuminata){37] darkly pigmented butterflies (pachliopta aristolochiae and troides rhadamantus plateni) and possibly blood-sucking bugs (triatoma infestans){38]although near-infrared vision (780xe2x80x931000xc2xa0nm) has long been deemed impossible due to noise in visual pigments{39] sensation of near-infrared light was reported in the common carp and in three cichlid species{39]{40]{41]{42]{43] fish use nir to capture prey{39] and for phototactic swimming orientation{43] nir sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during twilight{39] and in turbid surface waters{43]photobiomodulation{edit]near-infrared light or photobiomodulation is used for treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing there is some work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment{44] research projects include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase upregulation and other possible mechanisms{45]health hazard{edit]strong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be hazardous to the eyes resulting in damage or blindness to the user since the radiation is invisible special ir-proof goggles must be worn in such places{46]history of infrared science{edit]this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (july 2006) (learn how and when to remove this template message)the discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to william herschel the astronomer in the early 19th century herschel published his results in 1800 before the royal society of london herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared beyond the red part of the spectrum through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer he was surprised at the result and called them "calorific rays" the term 'infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century{47]{48]other important dates include:{17]infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by william herschel1737: xc3x89milie du chxc3xa2telet predicted what is today known as infrared radiation in dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu1835: macedonio melloni made the first thermopile ir detector1840: john herschel produces the first thermal image thermogram1860: gustav kirchhoff formulated the blackbody theorem e=j(tn){displaystyle e=j(tn)}1873: willoughby smith discovered the photoconductivity of selenium1878: samuel pierpont langley invents the first bolometer a device which is able to measure small temperature fluctuations and thus the power of far infrared sources1879: stefan-boltzmann law formulated empirically that the power radiated by a blackbody is proportional to t41880s  1890s: lord rayleigh and wilhelm wien solved part of the blackbody equation but both solutions diverged in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum this problem was called the "ultraviolet catastrophe and infrared catastrophe"1901: max planck published the blackbody equation and theorem he solved the problem by quantizing the allowable energy transitions1905: albert einstein developed the theory of the photoelectric effect1917: theodore case developed the thallous sulfide detector; british scientist built the first infra-red search and track (irst) device able to detect aircraft at a range of one mile (16xc2xa0km)1935: lead salts xe2x80x93 early missile guidance in world war ii1938: teau ta xe2x80x93 predicted that the pyroelectric effect could be used to detect infrared radiation1945: the zielgerxc3xa4t 1229 "vampir" infrared weapon system was introduced as the first portable infrared device for military applications1952: h welker grew synthetic insb crystals1950s: paul kruse (at honeywell) and texas instruments recorded infrared images1950s and 1960s: nomenclature and radiometric units defined by fred nicodemenus gj zissis and r clark; robert clark jones defined d1958: wd lawson (royal radar establishment in malvern) discovered ir detection properties of hgcdte1958: falcon and sidewinder missiles were developed using infrared technology1961: j cooper demonstrated pyroelectric detection1964: wg evans discovered infrared thermoreceptors in a pyrophile beetle{37]1965: first ir handbook; first commercial imagers (barnes agema {now part of flir systems inc}; richard hudson's landmark text; f4 tram flir by hughes; phenomenology pioneered by fred simmons and at stair; us army's night vision lab formed (now night vision and electronic sensors directorate (nvesd) and rachets develops detection recognition and identification modeling there1970: willard boyle and george e smith proposed ccd at bell labs for picture phone1972: common module program started by nvesd1978: infrared imaging astronomy came of age observatories planned irtf on mauna kea opened; 32 by 32 and 64 by 64 arrays produced using insb hgcdte and other materials2013: on february 14 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities{49]see also{edit]black-body radiationinfrared non-destructive testing of materialsinfrared solar cellsinfrared
