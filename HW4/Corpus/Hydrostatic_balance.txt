template message)in fluid mechanics a fluid is said to be in hydrostatic equilibrium or hydrostatic balance when it is at rest or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time this occurs when external forces such as gravity are balanced by a pressure gradient force{1] for instance the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing earth's atmosphere into a thin dense shell whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into spacehydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small solar system bodies and has other roles in astrophysics and planetary geology this qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a spheroid or ellipsoid shape where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid crust there are 31 observationally confirmed such objects (apart from the sun) sometimes called planemos{2] in the solar system seven more{3] that are virtually certain and a hundred or so more that are likely{3]contents1 mathematical consideration11 derivation from force summation12 derivation from navierxe2x80x93stokes equations13

highlighted volume of fluid is not moving the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwardsderivation from force summation{edit]newton's laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it this means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction this force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibriumthe fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements; by considering a single element the action of the fluid can be derivedthere are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure p of the fluid above it is from the definition of pressureftop=xe2x88x92ptopxe2x8bx85a{displaystyle f_{top}=-p_{top}cdot a}similarly the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards isfbottom=pbottomxe2x8bx85a{displaystyle f_{bottom}=p_{bottom}cdot a}finally the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards if the density is xcfx81 the volume is v and g the standard gravity then:fweight=xe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85v{displaystyle f_{weight}=-rho cdot gcdot v}the volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom times the heightxc2xa0xe2x80x94 the formula for finding the volume of a cubefweight=xe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85axe2x8bx85h{displaystyle f_{weight}=-rho cdot gcdot acdot h}by balancing these forces the total force on the fluid isxe2x88x91f=fbottom+ftop+fweight=pbottomxe2x8bx85axe2x88x92ptopxe2x8bx85axe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85axe2x8bx85h{displaystyle sum f=f_{bottom}+f_{top}+f_{weight}=p_{bottom}cdot a-p_{top}cdot a-rho cdot gcdot acdot h}this sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant dividing by a0=pbottomxe2x88x92ptopxe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85h{displaystyle 0=p_{bottom}-p_{top}-rho cdot gcdot h}orptopxe2x88x92pbottom=xe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85h{displaystyle p_{top}-p_{bottom}=-rho cdot gcdot h}ptop xe2x88x92 pbottom is a change in pressure and h is the height of the volume elementxe2x80x94a change in the distance above the ground by saying these changes are infinitesimally small the equation can be written in differential formdp=xe2x88x92xcfx81xe2x8bx85gxe2x8bx85dh{displaystyle dp=-rho cdot gcdot dh}density changes with pressure and gravity changes with height so the equation would be:dp=xe2x88x92xcfx81(p)xe2x8bx85g(h)xe2x8bx85dh{displaystyle dp=-rho (p)cdot g(h)cdot dh}derivation from navierxe2x80x93stokes equations{edit]note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional navierxe2x80x93stokes equations for the equilibrium situation whereu=v=xe2x88x82pxe2x88x82x=xe2x88x82pxe2x88x82y=0{displaystyle u=v={frac {partial p}{partial x}}={frac {partial p}{partial y}}=0}then the only non-trivial equation is the z{displaystyle z}-equation which now readsxe2x88x82pxe2x88x82z+xcfx81g=0{displaystyle {frac {partial p}{partial z}}+rho g=0}thus hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the navierxe2x80x93stokes equationsderivation from general relativity{edit]by plugging the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluidtxcexbcxcexbd=(xcfx81cxe2x88x922+p)uxcexbcuxcexbd+pgxcexbcxcexbd{displaystyle t^{mu u }=(rho c^{-2}+p)u^{mu }u^{u }+pg^{mu u }}into the einstein field

conditionxe2x88x87xcexbctxcexbcxcexbd=0{displaystyle abla _{mu }t^{mu u }=0}one can derive the tolmanxe2x80x93oppenheimerxe2x80x93volkoff equation for the structure of a static spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:dpdr=xe2x88x92gm(r)xcfx81(r)r2(1+p(r)xcfx81(r)c2)(1+4xcfx80r3p(r)m(r)c2)(1xe2x88x922gm(r)rc2)xe2x88x921{displaystyle {frac {dp}{dr}}=-{frac {gm(r)rho (r)}{r^{2}}}left(1+{frac {p(r)}{rho (r)c^{2}}}right)left(1+{frac {4pi r^{3}p(r)}{m(r)c^{2}}}right)left(1-{frac {2gm(r)}{rc^{2}}}right)^{-1}}in practice xcexa1 and xcfx81 are related by an equation of state of the form f(xcexa1xcfx81)=0 with f specific to makeup of the star m(r) is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density xcfx81(r) with the largest sphere having radius r:m(r)=4xcfx80xe2x88xab0rdrxe2x80xb2rxe2x80xb22xcfx81(rxe2x80xb2){displaystyle m(r)=4pi int _{0}^{r}dr'r'^{2}rho (r')}per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit we let cxe2x86x92xe2x88x9e so that the factor(1+p(r)xcfx81(r)c2)(1+4xcfx80r3p(r)m(r)c2)(1xe2x88x922gm(r)rc2)xe2x88x921xe2x86x921{displaystyle left(1+{frac {p(r)}{rho (r)c^{2}}}right)left(1+{frac {4pi r^{3}p(r)}{m(r)c^{2}}}right)left(1-{frac {2gm(r)}{rc^{2}}}right)^{-1}rightarrow 1}therefore in the nonrelativistic limit the tolmanxe2x80x93oppenheimerxe2x80x93volkoff equation reduces to newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:dpdr=xe2x88x92gm(r)xcfx81(r)r2=xe2x88x92g(r)xcfx81(r)xe2x9fxb6dp=xe2x88x92xcfx81(h)g(h)dh{displaystyle {frac {dp}{dr}}=-{frac {gm(r)rho (r)}{r^{2}}}=-g(r)rho (r)longrightarrow dp=-rho (h)g(h)dh}(we have made the trivial notation change h=r and have used f(xcexa1xcfx81)=0 to express xcfx81 in terms of p){4] a similar equation can be computed for rotating axially symmetric stars which in its gauge independent form reads:xe2x88x82ipp+xcfx81xe2x88x92xe2x88x82ilnxe2x81xa1ut+utuxcfx95xe2x88x82iuxcfx95ut=0{displaystyle {frac {partial _{i}p}{p+rho }}-partial _{i}ln u^{t}+u_{t}u^{phi }partial _{i}{frac {u_{phi }}{u_{t}}}=0}unlike the tov equilibrium equation these are two equations (for instance if as usual when treating stars one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates (trxcexb8xcfx95){displaystyle (trheta phi )} the index i runs for the coordinates r and xcexb8{displaystyle heta })applications{edit]fluids{edit]the hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to hydrostatics and the principles of equilibrium of fluids a hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water hydrostatic balance allows the discovery of their specific gravitiesastrophysics{edit]in any given layer of a star there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward the isotropic gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible a rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an oblate spheroid up to a certain (critical) angular velocity an extreme example of this phenomenon is the star vega which has a rotation period of 125 hours consequently vega is about 20 larger at the equator than at the poles a star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but piriform or oviform with yet other shapes beyond that though shapes beyond scalene are not stable{5]if the star has a massive nearby companion object then tidal forces come into play as well distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid an example of this is beta lyraehydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the intracluster medium where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a cluster of galaxieswe can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the velocity dispersion of dark matter in clusters of galaxies only baryonic matter (or rather the collisions thereof) emits x-ray radiation the absolute x-ray luminosity per unit volume takes the form lx=xcex9b(tb)xcfx81b2{displaystyle {mathcal {l}}_{x}=lambda (t_{b})rho _{b}^{2}} where tb{displaystyle t_{b}} and xcfx81b{displaystyle rho _{b}} are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter and xcex9b(t){displaystyle lambda (t)} is some function of temperature and fundamental constants the baryonic density satisfies the above equation dp=xe2x88x92xcfx81gdr{displaystyle dp=-rho gdr}:pb(r+dr)xe2x88x92pb(r)=xe2x88x92drxcfx81b(r)gr2xe2x88xab0r4xcfx80r2xcfx81m(r)dr{displaystyle p_{b}(r+dr)-p_{b}(r)=-dr{frac {rho _{b}(r)g}{r^{2}}}int _{0}^{r}4pi r^{2}rho _{m}(r)dr}the integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster with r{displaystyle r} being the proper distance to the center of the cluster using the ideal gas lawpb=ktbxcfx81bmb{displaystyle p_{b}=kt_{b}rho _{b}m_{b}} (k{displaystyle k} is boltzmann's constant and mb{displaystyle m_{b}} is a characteristic mass

particles and their density xcfx81d=xcfx81mxe2x88x92xcfx81b{displaystyle rho _{d}=rho _{m}-rho _{b}} satisfies the non-linear differential

then calculate the velocity dispersion xcfx83d2{displaystyle sigma _{d}^{2}} of the dark matter which is given byxcfx83d2=ktdmd{displaystyle sigma _{d}^{2}={frac {kt_{d}}{m_{d}}}}the central density ratio xcfx81b(0)xcfx81m(0){displaystyle rho _{b}(0)rho _{m}(0)} is dependent on the redshift z{displaystyle z} of the cluster and is given byxcfx81b(0)xcfx81m(0)xe2x88x9d(1+z)2(xcexb8s)32{displaystyle rho _{b}(0)rho _{m}(0)propto (1+z)^{2}left({frac {heta }{s}}right)^{32}}where xcexb8{displaystyle heta } is the angular width of the cluster and s{displaystyle s} the proper distance to the cluster values for the ratio range from 11 to 14 for various surveys{6]planetary geology{edit]the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet dwarf planet or small solar system body according to the definition of planet adopted by the international astronomical union in 2006 one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a planemo) though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 vesta may also be differentiated sometimes the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid as is the case with earth however in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid also the dwarf planet haumea is scalene due to its rapid rotationit had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400xc2xa0km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium whereas those smaller than that are not icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects the smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon mimas at 397xc2xa0km whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid pallas at 532xc2xa0km (582xc2xa0xc3x97xc2xa0556xc2xa0xc3x97xc2xa0500xc2xa0xc2xb1xc2xa018xc2xa0km) however mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation the smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon rhea at 1528xc2xa0km whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon iapetus at 1470xc2xa0kmbecause the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger satellites like the moon and io) have irregular surfaces this definition evidently has some flexibility but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard has not yet been announced local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium for example the massive base of the tallest mountain on earth mauna kea has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium the amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid vesta which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 5726xc2xa0xc3x97xc2xa05572xc2xa0xc3x97xc2xa04464xc2xa0km){7]atmospherics{edit]in the atmosphere the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude this pressure difference causes an upward force called the pressure-gradient force the force of gravity balances this out keeping the atmosphere bound to earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitudesee also{edit]list of solar
