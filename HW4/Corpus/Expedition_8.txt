the spacewalkers wore russian orlan space suitsthis was the 52nd spacewalk devoted to space station assembly operations and maintenance bringing the cumulative total to 322 hours and 32 minutes it was the 27th based out of the station bringing the total to 155 hours and 17 minutesmissionspacewalkersstart (utc)end (utc)durationexpedition 8eva 1michael foalealexander kaleri26 february 200421:1727 february 200401:123 hours 55 minutesthis spacewalk was cut short due a cooling system malfunction in kaleri's spacesuit although the spacewalk ended early foale and kaleri were able to complete a number of their tasks the first task was the replacement of cassette containers that hold sample materials for an experiment studying the effect of long-duration exposure to the microgravity environment later foale replaced two similar cassettes housed on the outside of the zvezda service module a russian experiment named matryoshka was attached to the outer hull of zvezda which will provide data on radiation exposure to the human body during space flight the spacewalkers also removed one of the suitcase-sized devices associated with the japanese aerospace exploration agency's mpac-seeds experiment they relocated a second device this experiment was studying micro-meteor impacts and material exposure in the space environment this experiment was installed on the iss by expedition 3 spacewalkers 15 october 2001 the crew was not able to complete the removal of laser light retroreflector devices from the aft end of zvezda the reflectors were being studied as navigation devices for the european space agency's automated transfer vehicle which first flew to the iss in 2008 another task not included was work on a materials science experiment called kromka this experiment measured the amount of residue emitted from zvezda's jet thruster firingsimages{edit]2004 photo mosaic the himalayas with makalu and mount everest from the international space station expedition 8references{edit]xc2xa0this article incorporatesxc2xa0public domain material from websites or documents of the national aeronautics and space administrationexternal links{edit]wikimedia commons has media related to iss expedition 8expedition 8 photographyvteexpeditions to the international space stationsee also: {{manned iss flights}} {{unmanned iss flights}}2000xe2x80x932004expedition 123456789102005xe2x80x932009expedition 1112131415161718192021222010xe2x80x932014expedition 23242526272829303132333435363738394041422015xe2x80x93presentexpedition 43444546474849505152expedition 53 (current)planned5455 book category list portal retrieved from ""categories: expeditions to the international space station2003 in spaceflight2004 in spaceflighthidden categories: use dmy dates from july 2013articles lacking sources from may 2008all articles lacking sourceswikipedia articles incorporating text from nasause british english from august 2010 navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version in other projectswikimedia commons languagescatalxc3xa0xc4x8cexc5xa1tinadeutschespaxc3xb1olfranxc3xa7aisitalianonederlandsxe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9exd9xbexdax9axd8xaaxd9x88polskiportuguxc3xaasxd0xa0xd1x83xd1x81xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8xd0xb9slovenxc4x8dinasuomisvenskaxd0xa3xd0xbaxd1x80xd0xb0xd1x97xd0xbdxd1x81xd1x8cxd0xbaxd0xb0 edit links  this page was last edited on 18 august 2017 at 12:47text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
