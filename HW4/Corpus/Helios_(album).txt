was released on october 21 2013{7] it was released to radio on october 22 2013{1] on may 9 2014 the band announced on their twitter page that the second single of the album is "break your plans"{8]critical reception{edit]professional ratingsreview scoressourceratingallmusic{9]ccm magazine{10]popmatters{11]upon its release helios received generally mixed reviews from music critics kevin catchpole from popmatters gave the album six out of ten discs commenting that "the disappointing thing is how slight moments of innovation appear for fleeting seconds only then disappear into the ether it suggests a band that is capable of so much more if only it wanted to try"{11] andy argyrakis of ccm magazine rated the album three stars out of five remarking how the release contains "plenty of uplifting and contemplative lyrics" yet their "signature piano pop surfaces on occasion there seems to be a gravitation toward gang-styled choruses and massive electronic beats which sometimes succeed but periodically appear too derivative of today's top 40"{10]james christopher monger from allmusic gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars indicating how that "helios begins innocuously enough with 'hold my hand' a straight-up anthem generator-spawned arm-waver that pairs a safe circular entirely familiar chord progression with a melody that returns the favor (a description that applies to most if not all of the ten songs that follow) before unleashing the album's first single 'love don't die' a digitized boot-stomper that leans hard on the kings of leonblack keys side of the fray spectrum flirtations with disco ('give it away') and pure killers-cloned electro-pop ('hurricane') follow but the fray never sound as comfortable as they do when they're dishing out relatively generic yet undeniably impassioned slabs of springsteen train goo goo dolls and coldplay-inspired open-highway treacle like 'our last days' and 'wherever this goes'"{9]track
