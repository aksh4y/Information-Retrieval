cyclone gafilo) was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the south-west indian ocean and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2004 being unusually large and violent gafilo was the deadliest and most destructive cyclone of the 2003xe2x80x9304 season according to the em-dat international disaster database gafilo killed at least 363 people{1] the gafilo cyclone also caused about 250 million (2004 usd) damages in madagascar which makes it one of most devastating storms to hit the country on reliable recordforming south of diego garcia it intensified into a moderate tropical storm on 3 march one day later gafilo became a tropical cyclone and it ultimately intensified into a very intense tropical cyclone on 6 march prior to making landfall over madagascar early on the next day after crossing the island gafilo emerged into the mozambique channel and made landfall over madagascar again on 9 march after a three-day loop overland the system arrived at the indian ocean on 13 march and it transitioned into a subtropical depression on 14 marchcontents1 meteorological history2 impact21 madagascar22 other islands3 aftermath4 records5 see also6 notes7 references8 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea disturbance formed south of diego garcia on 29 february and mxc3xa9txc3xa9o-france la rxc3xa9union (mfr) upgraded the identified system within the monsoon trough to a tropical disturbance on the next day on 2 march although the centre was exposed due to moderate easterly vertical wind shear the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system which was situated north of a subtropical ridge based on improved organisation of deep convection and moderate poleward outflow{2] however its temporary acceleration on that day lessened vertical wind shear{3] as the centre became under organised deep convection on 3 march the system intensified into a tropical depression then a moderate tropical storm named gafilo by the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in mauritius shortly before mfr even upgraded gafilo to a severe tropical storm later when the system slowed down and tracked west-northwestwards along the northern periphery of a building subtropical ridge it reached category 1 strength on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale late on 3 march{4] the complete pattern of the cyclone from march 4 to march 8 as it moved through the south western indian ocean has been recorded by the trmm through its satellite imagery trmm (tropical rainfall measuring mission) is a joint mission between nasa and the japanese space agency jaxa{5]tropical cyclone gafilo on 3 marchalthough dry air significantly reduced deep convection on 4 march mfr upgraded gafilo to a tropical cyclone because of a banding eye when the system began to expand its clockwise circulation and track west-southwestwards{6] by dual outflow channels gafilo underwent rapid deepening and reached category 4 strength on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale on 5 march as mfr also upgraded gafilo to an intense tropical cyclone late on the same day{7] on 6 march besides warm sea surface temperature above 29xc2xa0xc2xb0c the atypical third outflow channel from the west made conditions for the cyclone more favourable{8] therefore mfr upgraded gafilo to a very intense tropical cyclone with a very well-defined circular and warm 20 nautical miles (37xc2xa0km; 23xc2xa0mi) diameter eye at 06z when it also reached category 5 strength on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale{9] at 12z gafilo attained its peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 125 knots (230xc2xa0kmh 145xc2xa0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 895xc2xa0hpa (264xc2xa0inhg) although microwave imagery showed that the eyewall replacement cycle had begun{10]shortly after slightly weakening due to land interaction gafilo made landfall in the vicinity of antalaha madagascar early on 7 march unlike other storms the overland depression just weakened gradually because of its unusually large circulation making the outer part still at sea{11] on that day gafilo tracked more southwestwards along the northwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the southeast{12] before noon on 8 march gafilo arrived at the mozambique channel as a moderate tropical storm whose strongest winds were located in the northern sector{13] on 9 march gafilo became almost stationary and then tracked southeastwards along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the east mfr upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm supported by observed data from malagasy stations at noon; however jtwc analysed that the storm became below category 1 strength on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale at the same time in their best track data{14]late on 9 march gafilo made landfall north of morombe madagascar and the system started to make a three-day clockwise loop over the south part of madagascar{11] for the system further weakened after landfall jtwc analysed that gafilo dissipated overland late on 11 march as well as mfr issued a final warning on the overland depression which began to track southeastwards early on 12 march surprisingly mfr began to issue warnings again on the completely disorganised system at noon on 12 march as the residual centre was expected to go back overseas late on the same day jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the overland remnants because of improved deep convection over the low-level circulation centre poleward outflow and weak vertical wind shear{15]early on 13 march gafilo arrived at the indian ocean as a tropical disturbance; jtwc cancelled a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system because of the less organised low-level circulation centre and moderate vertical wind shear{16] gafilo transferred into a subtropical depression south of la rxc3xa9union on 14 march when the deep convective activity was intensifying with better organisation of a small cluster above the low-level circulation centre due to good upper-level divergence and a warm sea surface temperature of 26xc2xa0xc2xb0c to 29xc2xa0xc2xb0c{17] after attaining minor peak intensity in its subtropical period late on 14 march gafilo began to track eastward and transitioned into an extratropical depression on 15 march owing to a building subtropical ridge located to the southwest the extratropical depression slowed down and turned northwestwards on 16 march{18] after slowly weakening the system completely dissipated on 18 marchimpact{edit]madagascar{edit]destroyed coastline of mahajanga madagascargafilo caused strong winds and torrential rainfall over madagascar a half of day after the first landfall hurricane-force winds were still observed near mahajanga late on 7 march when gafilo was reorganising in the mozambique channel 190xc2xa0mm (75xc2xa0in) of precipitation was recorded at maintirano on 9 march as well as 242xc2xa0mm (95xc2xa0in) was recorded at txc3xb4lanaro on the same day during its three-day loop overland gafilo brought 238xc2xa0mm (94xc2xa0in) at morondava on 11 march{11]as elita has already struck madagascar one month ago damage from gafilo became extremely devastating in the country the national rescue council in antananarivo reported 237 dead 181 missing 879 injured and 304000 homeless (among which 174000 in antalaha alone) more than 20000 homes were destroyed as well as 413 public buildings and 3400 schools were damaged including 1400 completely destroyed ones the united nations estimated that there were 700000 disaster-stricken 280000 of which needed urgent assistance{11]despite being located 300xc2xa0km (190xc2xa0mi) north of gafiloxe2x80x99s centre the shipwreck of the ferry xe2x80x98samsonxe2x80x99 still happened at night on 7 march offshore the northwestern port of mahajanga a narrow but strong band of gafilo caused very rough conditions at sea making the ferry undergo an engine failure and tip over almost instantaneously while the number of fatalities remains undetermined (120 people were officially onboard) only three people drifted ran aground and survived from the shipwreckthe ferry was heading to madagascar from the coromos islands{19]{20]in antalaha food prices shot up by 35 and the harbour was badly damaged and not operational roads and bridges connecting the city to the outlying villages were inaccessible as well as electricity water and telephone lines were cut{21] overall in madagascar the main damage caused by gafilo was the subsequent flooding of vast areas in the north northwest and southwest where extensive the flooding had caused serious damage to vanilla rice and banana crops in many places the crops were expected to be totally lost{11]moreover shrimp harvesting also suffered some of the concerned areas coincided with those affected by elita and stocks and resources had therefore been depleted in many areas in the absence of immediate response an increase in water borne diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea could have had an immediate occurrence while outbreaks of cholera were expected to be witnessed within the coming 6xe2x80x938 weeks{21]{22]other islands{edit]damage was minimal to other islands in the south-west indian ocean but precipitation was very heavy far from the centre of gafilo 393xc2xa0mm (155xc2xa0in) was recorded at la rxc3xa9union within 48 hours and 159xc2xa0mm (63xc2xa0in) was recorded at seychelles on 4 march situated 160xc2xa0km (99xc2xa0mi) south of gafilo ten-minute maximum sustained winds were 49 knots with a peak gust of 66 knots recorded at tromelin island during 7 and 8 march precipitation at mayotte was recorded between 100 and 275xc2xa0mm (39 and 108xc2xa0in){23]aftermath{edit]following the passage of gafilo the malagasy government passed inter-ministerial order 179392004 in september 2004 which cleared the way for export of new and existing stocks of rosewood as xe2x80x98salvagexe2x80x99 this created anarchy in the national parks in the sava region with loggers extracting a large amounts of rosewood and ebony grossly disproportionate to the amount of damage caused by the storm{24]{25] during this time marojejy national park reported that with the granting of export rights logging in the park had resumed{26] it was not until 2006 with the passing of inter-ministerial order 160302006 that the export ban was reinstated nearly two years after the storm but not before the exporters lobbied the government for an extension xe2x80x98following the grievances expressed by operatorsxe2x80x99 in october 2005 per memorandum 92305{25]{27] exports were also authorized following cyclones in 2006 and 2007 encouraging the stockpiling of large quantities of lumber in both legal depots and hidden caches around the ports of vohxc3xa9mar and antalaha{27]records{edit]with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 125 knots (230xc2xa0kmh 145xc2xa0mph (later equaled by bruce in 2013 and hellen in 2014 and surpassed by eunice in 2015 with 10-min sustained winds of 130 knots (240xc2xa0kmh 150xc2xa0mph) and fantala in 2016 with 10-min sustained winds of 135 knots (250xc2xa0kmh 155xc2xa0mph)) and an atmospheric pressure of 895xc2xa0hpa (264xc2xa0inhg) gafilo became the most intense tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean since reliable records in addition gafilo was the only tropical cyclone in the basin having the atmospheric pressure below 900xc2xa0hpa (27xc2xa0inhg) since chris-damia in 1982 gafilo made landfall over madagascar early on 7 march as a very intense tropical cyclone with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 120 knots (220xc2xa0kmh 140xc2xa0mph) and an atmospheric pressure of 905xc2xa0hpa (267xc2xa0inhg) becoming the strongest storm to make landfall over madagascar and even africa on
