seasonshurricane otto was the first tropical cyclone since hurricane cesarxe2x80x93douglas in 1996 to survive the crossover from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean forming late on novemberxc2xa020 in the southwestern caribbean sea otto was the fifteenth and final named storm seventh hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it quickly intensified into a strong tropical storm the next day and on novemberxc2xa023xe2x80x9324 rapidly strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane the first in the month of november since hurricane paloma in 2008 and the latest date an atlantic hurricane attained such intensity on record{1] otto made landfall in nicaragua at peak intensity on novemberxc2xa024 thus becoming the latest hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began{1] traveling along the nicaraguaxe2x80x93costa rica border the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging over the eastern pacific ocean becoming the final storm of the 2016 pacific hurricane season as well hostile environmental conditions inhibited reorganization and otto subsequently degenerated into an elongated trough on novemberxc2xa026the hurricane's unusually southern formation in the caribbean sea led to impacts in countries rarely affected by tropical cyclones in particular panama and costa rica suffered extensive damage the storm claimed at least 23xc2xa0lives: 10 in costa rica 9 in panama and 4 in nicaragua otto also dropped torrential rainfall across the affected regions; some areas received up towards a month's worth of rain in only a matter of a day which led to life-threatening flooding which in turn led to landslides after the storm had passed recovery efforts begun with the national mourning of the victims followed by clean-up efforts overall total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded us190xc2xa0millioncontents1 meteorological history2 preparations impact and

saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon novemberxc2xa012 the national hurricane center (nhc) first noted the potential for a low pressure area to develop in the southwestern caribbean sea assessing a low probability for tropical cyclone formation within five days{2] after a convectively coupled kelvin wave and several nearby tropical waves interacted with each other in the aforementioned area atmospheric pressure in that region began falling on novemberxc2xa014{3] resulting in a broad low pressure area forming north of colombia on november 15{1] the low moved slowly and erratically with a disorganized structure and light winds{4] disrupted by unfavorable upper-level conditions{5] on novemberxc2xa019 the convection increased and became better organized amid marginally favorable conditions{6] the hurricane hunters flew into the system on novemberxc2xa020 observing a well-defined circulation and the system became a tropical depression at 18:00xc2xa0utc that day{1]a series of microwave satellite images depicting the inner structure of hurricane otto as it traversed central america note that despite crossing land its eye remained largely intactthe nascent depression meandered over the southwestern caribbean sea its path to the north blocked by a ridge{7] thunderstorm activity continued to pulse over the center{8] and the inner core of convection became more organized the depression intensified into a tropical storm by 06:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa021 receiving the name otto{1] the storm had well-established outflow to the northeast fueled by warm water temperatures of around 84xc2xa0xc2xb0f (29xc2xa0xc2xb0c){9] after the convection organized into a central dense overcast otto became a strong tropical storm with 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) winds and maintained that intensity for about a day on november 23 the storm reached hurricane intensity and began a period of rapid intensification reaching category 2 intensity by 06:00xc2xa0utc the following day with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh){1] six hours later otto reached its peak intensity as a category 3 major hurricane with winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) becoming the latest major hurricane on record in the satellite era{1]{10] at 17:30xc2xa0utc otto made landfall over the indio maxc3xadz biological reserve in southeastern nicaragua roughly 12 miles (19xc2xa0km) northwest of the nicaraguaxe2x80x93costa rica border at peak intensity this marked the southernmost landfall of a hurricane in central america since reliable records began eclipsing hurricane irenexe2x80x93olivia of 1971 by 30 to 35 miles (50 to 55xc2xa0km){1]after landfall otto's structure remained well-organized as it moved roughly parallel to the costa rica-nicaraguan border although cloud tops warmed indicating diminishing convection{11] despite moving over land the hurricane's eye remained well-defined and intact as it traversed nicaragua and costa rica{1] otto was the first atlantic hurricane on record to have its eye cross over costa rica{10] and the first hurricane-force system to traverse the nation{1] around 03:30xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa025 the eye of otto emerged over the eastern pacific near the gulf of papagayo completing a rare crossover from the atlantic to eastern pacific basinxe2x80x94the first such occurrence in which an atlantic tropical cyclone retained its name after a change in nhc naming policy in 2000{1] concurrently the system weakened to a tropical storm continuing to move westwards due to the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north otto steadily weakened as it moved away from central america unfavorable environmental conditions hastened the system's demise and otto weakened to a tropical depression on novemberxc2xa026 soon thereafter the system degraded into a trough roughly 490xc2xa0mi (790xc2xa0km) south of salina cruz mexico the remnant system continued to produce scattered convection for a few more days before dissipating entirely{1]preparations impact and aftermath{edit]panama{edit]tropical storm otto intensifying to the north of panama on november 22in bocas del toro preparations were made even though otto was not expected to directly make landfall in the region several patients were evacuated from hospitals{12] the nation was put on "hurricane alert" according to panamanian president juan carlos varela in a press conference varela stated that up to 600 relief units had been prepared in advance classes were also suspended in all public and private schools nationwide{12]the outer bands of otto caused extensive damage in panama; at least nine people died in various incidents related to the storm high winds downed trees in panama city one of which fell on a car killing a child landslides claimed three lives two people drowned while trying to cross a swollen swift-moving river on the outskirts of panama city offshore the ship jessica sank with six crew; three perished while the other three were rescued after clinging to inflatable rafts{13]nicaragua{edit]a hurricane watch was issued for the coast of nicaragua on november 22{14] which was upgraded into a warning the next day{15] schools were closed for the coming days as otto approached and about 10000 were in the process of being evacuated{16] officials also feared that otto could damage the nation's coffee crops which were close to being able to fully harvest{16]rainfall across nicaragua generally amounted to 3 to 6xc2xa0in (76 to 152xc2xa0mm) in southern and southwestern portions of the country; a peak value of 635xc2xa0in (161xc2xa0mm) was observed in el castillo{1] throughout the country otto damaged 857xc2xa0houses eight schools and two health facilities the storm passage caused 11678xc2xa0people to stay in 152xc2xa0temporary shelters after the storm 248xc2xa0people remained in the shelters while their damaged houses were rebuilt otto damaged 1700xc2xa0m (5600xc2xa0ft) of power lines resulting in power and water outages officials deployed 12000xc2xa0people to help ensure public safety and rescue efforts{17] there were four deaths in nicaragua related to the hurricane with five others missing as of novemberxc2xa026{18]costa rica{edit]infrared satellite loop of hurricane otto making landfall as category 3 in nicaragua on november 24in costa rica the government declared red alert for the northern portion of the national territory and the southern pacific region about 6800 people were evacuated to safer locations{19] costa rica president luis guillermo solxc3xads also issued a state of emergency and advised all vehicles to stay off the roads and that hospitals in the most at-risk areas were having their patients transferred somewhere else{16] he also advised that the hurricane could damage the agriculture supply in the nationotto was the first hurricane to pass directly over costa rica since records began{1] in costa rica some areas near the border with nicaragua observed over a month's worth of rainfall;{20] three-day accumulations exceeded 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) in many areas the highest recorded total was 1211xc2xa0in (308xc2xa0mm) at the miravalles volcano{1] the national meteorological institute of costa rica reported that otto killed at least ten people in the country mostly from flash flooding and landsides{1] including six in upala three in bagaces and one in guayabo{21] costa rican president luis guillermo solis described the situation as "chaotic and unprecedented" with the worst effects in upala canton{22] authorities calculated at least xe2x82xa1106 billion colxc3xb3nes (us190xc2xa0million) in damages across the country including us68xc2xa0million in upala canton and another us34xc2xa0million in bagaces{23] the hurricane damaged 14xc2xa0water systems{17] the president declared three days of national mourning in the wake of the hurricane{21]{22] officials opened 38xc2xa0shelters that housed 3370xc2xa0people mostly in upala about 10000xc2xa0people required humanitarian assistance following the storm local red cross volunteers police officers and firefighters brought food and other supplies to the 42xc2xa0communities left isolated due to otto by novemberxc2xa029 roads were repaired and cleared in most areas{17]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdue to otto's significant impacts in central america especially in costa rica panama and nicaragua the name otto was retired at the wmo's hurricane committee on marchxc2xa026 2017 and replaced with owen for the 2022 season the name otto will
