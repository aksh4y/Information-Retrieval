2823xc2xa0inhg) low-pressure area{3] in light of this the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00xc2xa0utc that day with its center situated roughly 175xc2xa0mi (285xc2xa0km) east-northeast of barbados{2]a slow-moving system the depression steadily organized as it approached the lesser antilles observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa07 resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm it was also assigned the name beulah making it the second named storm of the 1967 season shortly after being named beulah clipped the southern coast of martinique and entered the eastern caribbean sea feeding off the warm waters of the caribbean the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa08 rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the storm's central pressure falling to 940xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2775xc2xa0inhg) the following day as it passed 100xc2xa0mi (160xc2xa0km) south of puerto rico{3] at this time winds were estimated to be at least 140xc2xa0mph (225xc2xa0kmh) ranking beulah as a categoryxc2xa04 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{2] upon reaching this strength weather radar imagery from san juan puerto rico showed that beulah featured a 15xc2xa0mi (24xc2xa0km) wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8xc2xa0mi (13xc2xa0km) thick{4]radar images of hurricane beulah from 21:30 utc on september 9 to 03:30 utc on september 10 depicting its eyewall replacement cycleduring the evening of septemberxc2xa09 beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the bahamas between it and the newly formed tropical storm doria{3] the powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape during this phase the inner-eye of beulah contracted to roughly 3xe2x80x934xc2xa0mi (5xe2x80x936xc2xa0km) in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area 28xc2xa0mi (45xc2xa0km) across the smaller eye soon dissipated and the larger one became the single dominant feature by the morning of septemberxc2xa010 the completion of this marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety{4] the aforementioned westward turn placed the dominican republic in the line of danger an area still reeling from the devastating effects of hurricane inez just one year prior fortunately the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the barahona peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened though still significant hurricane with estimated winds of 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh) around 18:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa011{3]{2]skirting the southern coast of haiti's tiburon peninsula beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of septemberxc2xa012 unseasonably strong wind shear associated with the jet stream resulting from an upper-level trough to the north and the cyclone's interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation by the time it had cleared haiti beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm with winds near 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh){3] its pressure had also risen by roughly 60xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 177xc2xa0inhg) to 1000xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2953xc2xa0inhg){2] originally seen as a threat to jamaica northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on septemberxc2xa013 the shear previously impeding organization abated on septemberxc2xa014 and a ridge re-established itself to beulah's north allowing the storm to resume a west-northwest to northwest track the upper-level changes led to a favorable environment for intensification and beulah regained hurricane strength by 12:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa014 while located about 425xc2xa0mi (685xc2xa0km) south-southeast of havana cuba{3]{2]{5]a composite satellite image on septemberxc2xa017 depicting hurricanes beulah (bottom) doria (middle) and chloe (top)moving through the climatologically favorable western caribbean{3] beulah quickly regained major hurricane status on septemberxc2xa015 with winds estimated at 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){2] the storm's pressure fell to 964xc2xa0mb (hpa; 2847xc2xa0inhg) on septemberxc2xa016 before some weakening took place beulah ultimately made landfall on cozumel island with winds of at least 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) later that day and struck the mainland yucatxc3xa1n peninsula hours later despite moving over land little weakening took place by the time the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico about 24xc2xa0hours later{3] the hurricane maintained its intensity throughout septemberxc2xa018 as it moved west-northwest to southern tamaulipas mexico{2] however on septemberxc2xa019 a pronounced phase of rapid intensification took place as beulah turned northwest to the rio grande valley region aircraft reconnaissance throughout the day found falling pressures and ultimately measured a value of 923xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2725xc2xa0inhg) around 18:00xc2xa0utc this was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded by aircraft at the time behind a 920xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2717xc2xa0inhg) measurement in hurricane hattie of 1961{3] beulah was estimated to have achieved its peak intensity shortly thereafter as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane with winds estimated at 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){2]regarded as the third-largest hurricane on record at the time{6] beulah moved along a slowing erratic and somewhat cycloidal path slight weakening ensued as it neared land and beulah ultimately made its final landfall south of brownsville texas near the mouth of the rio grande river around 13:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa020 no direct measurements exist at the core of the hurricane as it moved ashore; however based on a minimum pressure of 951xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2809xc2xa0inhg) in brownsville the hurricane likely struck land at an intensity below that value{3] a vessel anchored in the port of brownsville measured peak wind gusts of 136xc2xa0mph (219xc2xa0kmh) equivalent to a low-end categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{5]{6] according to the national hurricane center beulah struck as a categoryxc2xa03 and had a pressure of 950xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2805xc2xa0inhg) though a conclusive estimate awaits re-evaluation as part of the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project{7] once over land the hurricane slowly weakened as it remained relatively close to the coast winds dropped below hurricane-force on septemberxc2xa021 roughly 24xc2xa0hours after landfall the system subsequently stalled near alice texas before turning to the southwest{3] after diminishing to a tropical depression late on septemberxc2xa022{2] beulah's circulation finally dissipated over the mountainous terrain of nuevo lexc3xb3n mexico{3]preparations{edit]nimbus satellite image of hurricane beulah over the eastern caribbean on septemberxc2xa09hispaniola{edit]following beulah's rapid intensification on septemberxc2xa09 a hurricane watch was issued for the whole of hispaniola on septemberxc2xa09 with emphasis on a threat to the southern coast warnings were soon raised for areas between barahona and cabo engaxc3xb1o in the dominican republic{5]across the dominican republic an estimated 200000xc2xa0people evacuated from coastal areas{3]united states{edit]beginning on the afternoon of september 17 people were advised to remain off the beaches of padre mustang and st joseph islands immediate evacuation of port aransas and mustang padre and st joseph islands was advised on the morning of september 19 most residents and others on the islands evacuated including the personnel of padre island national seashore about 40 persons remained on the islands including about 20 at port aransas immediate evacuation of rockport and live oak and lamar peninsulas was advised in the evening of september 19 these areas and the towns of ingleside and aransas pass were nearly completely evacuated about 50 persons remained in rockport the evacuation of the university of corpus christi was advised on the morning of september 20 and corpus christi beach and parts of flour bluff were also evacuated during the storm there were 30000xc2xa0people in shelters in nueces and san patricio counties including 6000 in corpus christi{8]impact{edit]eastern caribbean{edit]rainfall from hurricane beulah in puerto ricoin the days preceding beulah a stationary trough over the lesser antilles produced several days of heavy rain and set the stage for significant flooding{3] on septemberxc2xa07 beulah brought torrential rains to the already saturated region with reports of more than 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) received by the weather bureau hardest hit were the french west indies especially martinique{9] during an 18xe2x80x91hour span 1185xc2xa0in (301xc2xa0mm) fell on the island severe flooding claimed 15xc2xa0lives on martinique and destroyed many homes{3]{10] parts of fort-de-france were inundated by 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) of water while the martinique international airport saw 1xc2xa0ft (030xc2xa0m) of flooding the banana crop sustained extensive losses{9]{10] across the island nearly 1000xc2xa0residents were left homeless including 400 in fort-de-france{11] damage on the island amounted to 45xc2xa0million{3] supplies of fresh water were severely limited for two days following the storm{11]heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides across st vincent blocking numerous roads and causing some damage two children were killed after a boulder dislodged by the rains crashed into their home{12] damage on st lucia reached 3xc2xa0million mainly stemming from the banana crop which was largely ruined{3] the periphery of the hurricane brought rainfall primarily to southwestern puerto rico where a maximum of 976 inches (248xc2xa0mm) fell at maricao{13] one person lost their life on the island and damage was a minimal 150000{3]owing to effective evacuations only two people lost their lives in the dominican republic the core of beulah impacted areas devastated by hurricane inez a year prior and left extensive damage in its wake{3] early reports indicated that more than 1000xc2xa0people were left homeless across the barahona peninsula{14] flash flooding affected the southern coasts of both the dominican republic and haiti{15]beulah had limited impact on jamaica as it brushed the island as a weak tropical storm{3] according to newspapers gale-force winds affected the nation though there were no reports of damage{16]mexico{edit]rainfall from hurricane beulah across mexico and texasstriking cozumel island and the yucatan peninsula on septemberxc2xa017 as categoryxc2xa02 hurricane beulah caused considerable damage and killed 11 people across the region wind gusts up to 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) severed communication lines downed power lines and felled trees{5] the puerto morelos lighthouse on the riviera maya was undermined by the storm;
