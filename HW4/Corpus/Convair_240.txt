produced by convair from 1947 to 1954 initially as a possible replacement of the ubiquitous douglas dc-3 featuring a more modern design with cabin pressurization the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in various civil and military variants although reduced in numbers through attrition the "convairliners" in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century{1]contents1 design and development2 operational history3 variants31 civil variants32 military variants4 operators41 civil operators411 africa412

see also8 references81 notes82 bibliography9 external linksdesign and development{edit]the design began its life in a requirement by american airlines for an airliner to replace its douglas dc-3s convair's original design the unpressurised model 110 was a twin-engine low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with 30 seats it was powered by pratt  whitney r-2800 double wasp radial engines and had a tricycle landing gear and a ventral airstair for passenger boarding{2] the prototype model 110 registration nx90653 first flew on july 8 1946{2] by this time american had changed its requirements to require pressurization and deemed the design too small the first prototype was used by convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947{3]a 1949-built convair 240 of swiss air lines at manchester england in march 1950to meet the requirements of airlines for a pressurized airliner convair produced a revised designxe2x80x94the model 240 this had a longer but thinner fuselage than the model 110 accommodating 40 passengers in the first pressurized twin-engined airliner{4] the 240 first flew on march 16 1947{5]the model 240 was followed by the model 340 that had a longer fuselage longer-span wings and more powerful engines the 340 first flew on october 5 1951{6] in 1954 in an attempt to compete with turboprop-powered airliners like the vickers viscount convair produced the model 440 metropolitan with more streamlined cowlings new engine exhausts and better soundproofing for the cabin{7] as the "super 240" evolved into the cv-340 and cv-440 the limit of piston-engine performance was reached and future development centered on conversion to turboprop power{1]operational history{edit]the first delivery of a production convairliner was to american on february 29 1948{5] a total of 75 were delivered to american with another 50 going to western airlines continental airlines pan american airways klm swissair sabena and trans australia airlines{8]two convair 580s of the aspen colorado-based aspen airways at stapleton international airport in denver us in 1986a cv-240 was the first private aircraft used in a united states presidential campaign in 1960 john f kennedy used a cv-240 named caroline (after his daughter) during his campaign this aircraft is now preserved in the national air and space museumafter aborted negotiations with twa and eastern for "super 240" orders the production of the 240 series was temporarily halted in response to a united inquiry convair redesigned the super 240 calling it the cv-340 united ordered 55 and more us orders came from braniff continental delta northeast and national other orders came from abroad and the cv-340 proved popular in south america the cv-340 earned an enviable reputation for reliability and profitability and was developed into the cv-440 metropolitan the final piston-engined variant of the "convairliners"{1]kelowna flightcraft air charter the major

operated the type from early 1953 until mid-1963 many cv-340 aircraft were converted to cv-440 standard{12]convair cv-440 metropolitancv-340 with improved soundproofing and an option for weather radar maximum weight rose to 49700xc2xa0lbs an optional increase from 44 to 52 passengers was facilitated by the replacement of the carry-on luggage area with two more rows of seats marked by the addition
