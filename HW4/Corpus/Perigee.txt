latin from greek and is cognate with apse{1] for elliptic orbits about a larger body there are two apsides named with the prefixes peri- (from xcfx80xcexb5xcfx81xcexaf (peri) meaning 'near') and ap- or apo- (from xe1xbcx80xcfx80(xcfx8c) (ap(xc3xb3)) meaning 'away from') added to a reference to the thing being orbitedfor a body orbiting the sun the point of least distance is the perihelion (xcbx8cpxc9x9brxc9xaaxcbx88hixcbx90lixc9x99n) and the point of greatest distance is the aphelion (xc3xa6pxcbx88hixcbx90lixc9x99n){2]the terms become periastron and apastron when discussing orbits around other starsfor any satellite of earth including the moon the point of least distance is the perigee (xcbx88pxc9x9brxc9xaadxcax92ixcbx90) and greatest distance the apogeefor objects in lunar orbit the point of least distance is the pericynthion (xcbx8cpxc9x9brxc9xaaxcbx88sxc9xaanxcexb8ixc9x99n) and the greatest distance the apocynthion (xcbx8cxc3xa6pxc9x99xcbx88sxc9xaanxcexb8ixc9x99n) perilune and apolune are also used{3]for any orbits around a center of mass there are the terms periapsis and apoapsis (or apapsis) pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternativesa straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse its greatest diameter for a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse when one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus however whether or not this is the case both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system's center of mass with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses historically in geocentric systems apsides were measured from the center of the earth however in the case of the moon the center of mass of the earthxe2x80x93moon system or earthxe2x80x93moon barycenter as the common focus of both the moon's and earth's orbits about each other is about 75 of the way from earth's center to its surfacein orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body (assuming a constant standard reference radius)contents1 mathematical formulae2 terminology21 terminology graph3 perihelion and aphelion of the earth4 planetary perihelion and aphelion5 see also6 references7

objects the '-gee' '-helion' and '-astron' and '-galacticon' forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix '-jove' is occasionally used for jupiter while '-saturnium' has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the '-gee' form is commonly used as a generic 'closest approach to planet' term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion (referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis) were used when referring to the moon{4] regarding black holes the term periapomelasma (from a greek root) was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before periaponigricon (from a latin) appeared in the scientific literature in 2002{5]terminology graph{edit]the following suffixes are added to peri- and apo- to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objectssolar

removed (january 2017) (learn how and when to remove this template message)for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earth's eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycleson a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22000 to 26000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession (this is closely related to the precession of the axis)currently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earth's center is about

express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so-called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 was about 282895xc2xb0 by the year 2010 this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283067xc2xb0{6]the dates and times
