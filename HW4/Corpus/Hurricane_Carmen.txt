peninsula belize louisiana texaspart of the 1974 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1974 atlantic hurricane season a destructive and widespread storm carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from africa toward the end of august the disturbance traveled westward spawning a tropical depression east of the lesser antilles on augustxc2xa029 the storm moved through the caribbean sea and in an environment conducive to intensification it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale carmen moved ashore on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula where despite striking a sparsely populated region it caused significant crop damage and killed several people before the storm's arrival officials had set up several evacuation centers and many residents had moved to higher groundupon entering the gulf of mexico carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the united states initially threatening the major city of new orleans it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern louisiana eventually dissipating over eastern texas on septemberxc2xa010 tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm and approximately 100000 residents left their homes and sought shelter damage was lighter than first feared but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses throughout its course the hurricane killed 8 people and caused 162xc2xa0million in damage due to the severity of the storm the name carmen was retired from the list of atlantic tropical cyclone namescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 yucatxc3xa1n peninsula32 united states4 see also5 references6 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of hurricane carmen can be traced to a weather disturbance over africa during the middle of augustxc2xa01974 the disturbance moved slowly westward with little convective activity initially although upon entering the atlantic ocean it spawned a tropical wave within the intertropical convergence zone the wave had intensified and broadened by augustxc2xa025 and it eventually split into two components the northernmost of which consolidated into an organized storm system{1] moving westward the system developed into a tropical depression on augustxc2xa029 more than 200xc2xa0mi (320xc2xa0km) east of guadeloupe{2] due to favorable outflow from an anticyclone nearby the depression gradually strengthened as it moved through the lesser antilles{3] it attained tropical storm status on august 30 south of puerto rico{2] and was named carmen by the national hurricane center{4] at first the storm's proximity to hispaniola prevented further strengthening{5] but by augustxc2xa031 it had managed to intensify into a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{2] as carmen passed south of jamaica an eye feature briefly appeared{6]on septemberxc2xa01 the hurricane began to rapidly deepen over warm waters of the caribbean sea; by 1800xc2xa0coordinated universal time (utc) it had strengthened to categoryxc2xa04 intensity{2] continuing westward the storm passed north of swan island later that day{3] early on septemberxc2xa02 a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery{7] carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction{8] and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 274xc2xa0inhg){2] atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker and carmen slowed to a drift{9] later on septemberxc2xa02 the hurricane made landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula; its northern jog spared belize city from a direct hit the storm's center passed a few miles north of chetumal quintana roo{2]the cyclone drifted inland deteriorating to a tropical storm on septemberxc2xa03{2] about a day later carmen emerged into the gulf of mexico where it nearly stalled turning northward the storm regained hurricane strength on septemberxc2xa05{2] carmen continued to strengthen and accelerated northward towards the united states gulf coast{3] reaching a forward speed of 12xc2xa0mph (19xc2xa0kmh); at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa07 it once again became a categoryxc2xa03 major hurricane{2] the storm reached its second peak intensity while located south of louisiana; although the wind speeds were identical to that of its initial peak the barometric pressure was slightly higher carmen weakened and veered westward before landfall ultimately striking south-central louisiana after moving ashore the hurricane quickly lost strength and late on septemberxc2xa09 degenerated into a tropical depression the depression moved westward and soon dissipated over eastern texas{2]preparations{edit]hurricane carmen in the gulf of mexico near landfall in louisianainitial reactions to the approaching hurricane in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula were regarded as calm by the united states media mexican officials declared an emergency alert by septemberxc2xa02 although they did not advise any evacuations meteorologists in the united states urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately{10] fearing significant loss of life and property the red cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in belize{10] the following day the mexican army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities mobile communication units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm's passage{11] many of the nearly 35000xc2xa0residents in and around the city of chetumal evacuated to higher ground{12]although it initially threatened the united states city of new orleans the hurricane turned west prior to making landfall and spared the area from severe damage{3] contrary to its actual path forecasters predicted the hurricane to execute an eastward swerve toward florida had the cyclone instead continued northward and traveled over lake pontchartrain low-lying areas could have suffered "catastrophic" flooding{13] over 100000xc2xa0residents of the gulf coast mostly in louisiana and mississippi evacuated in advance of the hurricane{14] causing heavy congestion on highways{13] about 60000xc2xa0people sought shelter in facilities across the new orleans region according to red cross officials{15]hurricane warnings were issued along the coast while coast guard personnel went door-to-door on grand isle urging residents to leave the area from there through the coast of southwestern florida small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas{16] offshore workers were removed from oil rigs{17] many mississippi citizens having experienced the destruction of hurricane camille just five years earlier quickly left their coastal homes{18]impact{edit]as a tropical depression and storm carmen produced moderate rainfall across puerto rico and the northern lesser antilles peaking at 591xc2xa0in (150xc2xa0mm) in jajome alto puerto rico{19] the storm spawned a tornado on puerto rico and triggered flash flooding which collectively left over 2xc2xa0million in damage{3] winds approaching gale force affected several islands{20] heavy rain fell on hispaniola as the storm progressed westward{21] and on jamaica the storm caused three drownings{22] high winds and heavy rainfall were reported there and in cuba{23] the hurricane damaged local reefs on the north shore of jamaica during its passage{24]following the storm the name carmen was retired from the annually rotating list of hurricane names{25] however due to a change in the naming scheme in 1979 it was not replaced by any particular name{26]yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{edit]radar image of hurricane carmen near landfall on september 2although carmen made landfall as a powerful categoryxc2xa04 hurricane it caused significantly less damage than anticipated because it struck a sparsely populated region however torrential rainfall from the storm inundated farmland across the region ruining rice crops the fishing industry also sustained major losses communication with the hardest hit regions was lost following carmen's passage; however early reports stated that at least five people were injured{11] several days later officials in mexico confirmed that three people had been killed by the storm the city of chetumal was described as a "disaster" and hundreds of people were left homeless{27] more than 5000xc2xa0people in the city lost their belongings as a result of the storm officials in the area estimated that damage in chetumal alone reached 8xc2xa0million (1974xc2xa0usd){28] throughout the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula hurricane carmen claimed four lives and wrought 10xc2xa0million (1974xc2xa0usd) in damage{29]following carmen's passage officials feared the worst for an area of 1000xc2xa0mi2 (2590xc2xa0km2) where communication was lost in belize a reconnaissance task force was sent out from belize city the day after carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm{30] one person was killed off the coast of belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by carmen three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm crop damage in the country was reportedly severe{31]united states{edit]carmen dropped moderate rainfall along its path though the heaviest rainfall occurred well to the east of the storm's center in southern alabama and the northern florida panhandle precipitation peaked at over 13xc2xa0in (330xc2xa0mm) in atmore alabama{19] winds gusted up to 86xc2xa0mph (138xc2xa0kmh) and along the coast tides ran as high as 6xc2xa0ft (18xc2xa0m) above normal{3] over northwestern louisiana winds ranged from 40 to 45xc2xa0mph (64 to 72xc2xa0kmh) and brought down several trees{32] in new orleans despite wind gusts to 72xc2xa0mph (116xc2xa0kmh) minimal damage was reported{33] the hurricane's effects in baton rouge were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees{34] because carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland it caused far less damage than initially feared{35] nonetheless tidal flooding from the gulf of mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe freshwater flooding was less extreme in total the storm inundated 2380500 acres (963400xc2xa0ha) of land in louisiana including 742300 acres (300400xc2xa0ha) in terrebonne parish and 590000 acres (240000xc2xa0ha) in plaquemines parish{36]{37]rainfall map of the gulf coastthe storm's greatest impact was the loss of sugar cane crops in louisiana an estimated 308000 acres (125000xc2xa0ha) of sugar cane in 16xc2xa0parishes was damaged and about 20xc2xa0percent was completely ruined{38] after a tour of the affected area then-governor edwin edwards estimated crop damage alone at 400xc2xa0million{39] although a more recent estimate placed total agricultural damage from the hurricane at 74xc2xa0million{36] the sugar cane crop was crucial to the country's sugar supplies rendering the losses "doubly bad"{39] and sugar futures rose drastically after the storm{40] other crops damaged by carmen included soybeans rice and cotton{36]tidal action along the coast affected the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies the sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants fish shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of hurricane carmen flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown several parks in louisiana sustained damage either from flooding or high winds; losses to grand island state park in particular totaled 114600 the oil and gas industry was also affected and its estimated 247xc2xa0million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities the storm diminished oil production by 14 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations{36] over 60000 electric cooperative customers lost power{41]the hurricane caused two fatalities in louisiana: a utility repairman who was electrocuted while working on power lines damaged by strong winds{39] and a motorist who was involved in a storm-related traffic accident{42] total monetary losses in the state was estimated 150 million{3] overall the hurricane spawned four confirmed tornadoes{43] one touched down near brandon mississippi destroying a barn and causing other damage{44] another struck kaplan louisiana injuring one person{45] the storm's effects in mississippi were described as minimal and were mainly confined to minor traffic accidents during bouts of heavy precipitation{46] light to moderate rainfall from the storm extended as far east as florida and georgia and as far west as oklahoma and texas{19]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of atlantic hurricaneslist of retired
