storm agni was a tropical cyclone of the 2004 north indian ocean cyclone season notable for its record proximity to the equator it was the second north indian ocean cyclone to receive a name after onil earlier in the year agni formed on novemberxc2xa028 well to the southwest of india in the arabian sea and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) estimated peak 1xc2xa0minute sustained winds of 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) while the india meteorological department (imd) estimated peak 3xc2xa0minute sustained winds of 100xc2xa0kmh (65xc2xa0mph); the imd is the official warning center for the north indian ocean after peaking it weakened due to wind shear dry air and cooler waters and the jtwc issued its final advisory on decemberxc2xa03 as it approached the coast of somalia the remnants of agni moved along the somalian coastline until dissipating on decemberxc2xa05contents1 meteorological history2 records naming and impact3 see also4 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical disturbance was observed on novemberxc2xa019 about 800xc2xa0km (500xc2xa0mi) southeast of colombo sri lanka in the bay of bengal{1] the disturbance tracked westward gradually organizing and prompting the jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert (tcfa) on novemberxc2xa022 after passing south of sri lanka it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone{2] the circulation associated with the system continued westward reorganizing on novemberxc2xa026 in the arabian sea{1] despite being located unusually close to the equator the disturbance maintained convection or thunderstorms which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation with low wind shear and diffluence aloft the jtwc remarked the system had a fair chance of developing{3]while the system was organizing the center crossed the equator to reach about 05xc2xb0xc2xa0s thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in the southern hemisphere this was unusual as the coriolis effect is nonexistent along the equatorxe2x80x94the coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity which provides the spin in a cyclone{1]{4] the jtwc later assessed the system as remaining in the northern hemisphere reaching as far south as 07xc2xb0xc2xa0n or about 80xc2xa0km (50xc2xa0mi) from the equator{5] after the circulation organized further beneath the convection the jtwc issued another tcfa at 0300xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa028{6] three hours later the agency classified the system as tropical cyclone 05a about 1300xc2xa0km (800xc2xa0mi) southwest of the southern tip of india{7] in a post-season analysis the jtwc estimated the cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier{5] at around the same time the imd classified it as a "low pressure area likely to become well marked"{8]upon being classified the tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under the influence of a ridge over india its outflow to the north and south became better defined although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear{9] early on novemberxc2xa029 the imd classified the system as a depression{10] and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm; a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) winds sustained for 3xc2xa0minutes{11] around that time the jtwc assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) sustained for 1xc2xa0minute along with gusts to 150xc2xa0kmh (90xc2xa0mph) late on novemberxc2xa029 the cyclone weakened slightly only to regain its peak intensity by novemberxc2xa030;{5] at that time it developed a banding eye and was located about 1500xc2xa0km (900xc2xa0mi) southeast of the coast of somalia{12] at 1200xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa030 the imd issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone naming it severe cyclonic storm agni and estimating peak winds at 100xc2xa0kmh (65xc2xa0mph); the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening{13] at its peak the cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985xc2xa0mbar{14]cyclone agni near peak intensityafter reaching peak intensity an increase in wind shear caused the eye to disappear{15] and the convection decreased significantly{16] on decemberxc2xa01 the imd estimated agni weakened to cyclonic storm status{17] around which time the center became exposed from the convection{18] the cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear the presence of dry air and cooler water temperatures{19] and by decemberxc2xa02 the imd downgraded agni to depression status which was its final warning on the system{20] as it approached the coast of somalia it turned westward due to the building of a ridge over saudi arabia{21] despite unfavorable conditions thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity{22] by late on decemberxc2xa03 agni weakened to below tropical storm status and the jtwc issued its final warning while the storm was about 450xc2xa0km (275xc2xa0mi) south-southeast of cape guardafuixe2x80x94the easternmost point of the horn of africa{23] the circulation became difficult to locate by early on decemberxc2xa04 by which time the system had little remaining convection{24] it turned southwestward and later to the south moving ashore on eastern somalia before dissipating on decemberxc2xa05 near ceel huur over water{5]records naming and impact{edit]according to rsmc new delhi cyclone agni developed into a depression at 15xc2xb0xc2xa0n which is the same latitude as where according to rsmc tokyo tropical storm vamei formed during december 2001{25]{26] however according to rsmc la reunion the precursor low to cyclone agni moved into the southern hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter-clockwise circulation{27]agni was the second storm in the north indian ocean to receive a name after the imd began tropical cyclone naming in the middle of 2004{28]as the cyclone was weak when it moved over somalia no casualties or significant damage was reported{5]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of near-equatorial
