college in the province of new york began as early as 1704 at which time colonel lewis morris wrote to the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts the missionary arm of the church of england persuading the society that new york city was an ideal community in which to establish a college{34] however it was not until the founding of the college of new jersey (the present princeton university) across the hudson river in new jersey that the city of new york seriously consider founding a college{34] in 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of new york to raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751 the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college{35]classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president dr samuel johnson{36] dr johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class which consisted of a mere eight students instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining trinity church located on what is now lower broadway in manhattan{37] the college was officially founded on october 31 1754 as king's college by royal charter of king george ii making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of new york and the fifth oldest in the united states{20]in 1763 dr johnson was succeeded in the presidency by myles cooper a graduate of the queen's college oxford and an ardent tory in the charged political climate of the american revolution his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777 alexander hamilton{38] the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776 and was catastrophic for the operation of king's college which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the continental army the suspension continued through the military occupation of new york city by british troops until their departure in 1783 the college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by american and then british forces{39]{40] loyalists were forced to abandon their king's college in new york which was seized by the rebels and renamed columbia college the loyalists led by bishop charles inglis fled to windsor nova scotia where they founded king's collegiate school{41]18th century{edit]the gothic revival law school building on the madison avenue campusafter the revolution the college turned to the state of new york in order to restore its vitality promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand{42] the legislature agreed to assist the college and on may 1 1784 it passed "an act for granting certain privileges to the college heretofore called king's college"{43] the act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of king's college and in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new republic the legislature stipulated that "the college within the city of new york heretofore called king's college be forever hereafter called and known by the name of columbia college"{43] a reference to columbia an alternative name for america the regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in february 1787 and appointed a revision committee which was headed by john jay and alexander hamilton in april of that same year a new charter was adopted for the college still in use today granting power to a private board of 24 trustees{44]on may 21 1787 william samuel johnson the son of dr samuel johnson was unanimously elected president of columbia college prior to serving at the university johnson had participated in the first continental congress and been chosen as a delegate to the constitutional convention{45] for a period in the 1790s with new york city as the federal and state capital and the country under successive federalist governments a revived columbia thrived under the auspices of federalists such as hamilton and jay both president george washington and vice president john adams attended the college's commencement on may 6 1789 as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the american revolution{46]the library at columbia university ca 190019th century to present{edit]low memorial libraryin november 1813 the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with the college of physicians and surgeons a new school created by the regents of new york forming columbia university college of physicians and surgeons{2] the college's enrollment structure and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned in 1857 the college moved from the king's college campus at park place to a primarily gothic revival campus on 49thxc2xa0street and madison avenue where it remained for the next forty years during the last half of the 19th century under the leadership of president fap barnard the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university{47] by this time the college's investments in new york real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school mainly owing to the city's expanding population{48] university president seth low moved the campus from 49thxc2xa0street to its present location a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of morningside heights{49] under the leadership of low's successor nicholas murray butler who served for over four decades columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research setting the "multiversity" model that later universities would adopt{20] prior to becoming the president of columbia university butler founded teachers college as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor with philanthropist grace hoadley dodge{50] teachers college came under the aegis of columbia university in 1893 and became the university's graduate school of education{51]research into the atom by faculty members john r dunning i i rabi enrico fermi and polykarp kusch placed columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the manhattan project{52] in 1928 seth low junior college was established by columbia university in order to mitigate the number of jewish applicants to columbia college{53] the college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the great depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into university extension{54] in 1947 the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the school of general studies in response to the return of gis after world war ii{55] in 1995 the school of general studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum{56] within the same year the division of special programsxe2x80x94later the school of continuing education and now the school of professional studiesxe2x80x94was established to reprise the former role of university extension{57] while the school of professional studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields{58]alma materin the aftermath of world war ii the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university and in response the school of international and public affairs was founded in 1946 drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science economics and history{59]during the 1960s columbia experienced large-scale student activism which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus the incident forced the resignation of columbia's president grayson kirk and the establishment of the university senate{60]{61]though several schools within the university had admitted women for years columbia college first admitted women in the fall of 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with barnard college the all-female institution affiliated with the university to merge the two schools{62] barnard college still remains affiliated with columbia and all barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both columbia university and barnard college{63]in the 1970s teachers college's departments ran joint phd programs with the university in the disciplines of psychology history and anthropology and all teachers college diplomas were conferred by columbia university{50] teachers college was soon established as the university's faculty of education and department of education{51]during the late 20th century the university underwent significant academic structural and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university for much of the 19th century the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in political science philosophy and pure science in 1979 these faculties were merged into the graduate school of arts and sciences{64] in 1991 the faculties of columbia college the school of general studies the graduate school of arts and sciences the school of the arts and the school of professional studies were merged into the faculty of arts and sciences leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools in 2010 the school of international and public affairs which was previously a part of the faculty of arts and sciences became an independent faculty{65]campus{edit]according to new york columbia university is the second largest landowner in new york city after the catholic church{66]morningside heights{edit]college walkthe majority of

1903 as a gift of mr  mrs robert goelet and was originally covered in golden leaf during the columbia university protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture but it has since been repaired{76] the small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many columbia legends the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian and that any subsequent columbia male who finds it will marry a barnard student given that barnard is a women's college{77]{78]"the steps" alternatively known as "low steps" or the

columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the pentagon's weapons research think-tank the institute for defense analyses (ida) students barricaded themselves inside low library hamilton hall and several other university buildings during the protests and new york city police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students{194]{195]the protests achieved two of their stated goals columbia disaffiliated from the ida and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead a popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by princeton university for the expansion of its athletic facilities but as jadwin gymnasium was already 50 complete by 1966 (when the columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct{196] at least 30 columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests many of the class of '68

investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in south africa a notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978 when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968 students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in south africa the committee against investment in south africa (caisa) and numerous student groups including the socialist action committee the black student organization and the gay students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of

campus{206] columbia students though turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the south lawn an estimated 2500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasionduring his speech ahmadinejad criticized israel's policies towards the palestinians; called for research on the historical accuracy of the holocaust; raised questions as to who initiated the 911 attacks; defended iran's nuclear power program criticizing the un's policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked us foreign policy in the middle east in response to a question about iran's treatment of women and homosexuals he asserted that women are respected in iran and that "in iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country in iran we do not have this phenomenon i don't know who told you this"{207]

that he did not favor reinstating columbia's rotc program because of the military's anti-gay policies in november 2008 columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite rotc back to campus and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue rotc lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration and did not include graduate students faculty or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point{citation needed]in april 2010 during admiral mike mullen's address at columbia president lee c bollinger stated that the rotc would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the don't ask don't tell policy were successful in february 2011 during one of three town-hall meetings on the rotc ban former army staff sergeant anthony maschek a purple heart recipient for injuries sustained during his service in iraq was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of
