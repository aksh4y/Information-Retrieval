like the cphc it took responsibility in 1970 but it is now folded into the nhcin this area the hurricane season lasts from june 1 through november 30 practically storms may form in the eastern pacific region (east or west of 140xc2xb0w) and move west possibly affecting hawaixe2x80x98i or in the western pacific basin and move west possibly affecting asia smaller islands may also be affected though this region is otherwise very sparsely populatedhurricane naming system{edit]further information: list of tropical cyclone namesnaming listlist 1list 2list 3list 4akoniakaalikaanaemaekekaeleelahonehenehukohalolaionaiolanaiopaiunekelikeonikikakilolalalinolanalokemokemelemakamalianolononanekinialaolanaoliwaomekaohopenapamapewapaliulanaupanaunalaulikawalewenewaliwalakathe central pacific hurricane center uses traditional hawaiian names for hurricanes that form within its regional sphere of jurisdiction it has formed four lists of names to choose from as soon as all the names are exhausted from the first list it moves on to the second then third then fourth then back to the first and so on unlike the name list in the atlantic and eastern pacific the names do not start at "a" every year four names have been retired iwa of 1982 iniki of 1992 paka of 1997 and ioke of 2006 they were replaced by io (which was later changed to iona) iolana pama and iopa respectively the next name to be used from the list is 'walaka'forecasting system{edit]since the 1990s the cphc has used the automated tropical cyclone forecasting system to create forecasts advisories and their associated graphicssee also{edit]tropical cyclones portalnational hurricane centerexternal links{edit]central pacific hurricane center retrieved from ""categories: national weather servicetropical cyclone meteorologypacific hurricanes1970 establishments in hawaiiregional specialized meteorological centresorganizations based in honoluluorganizations established in 1970 navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagesdeutschespaxc3xb1olfranxc3xa7aisnederlandsxe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9eportuguxc3xaassimple englishxd0xa3xd0xbaxd1x80xd0xb0xd1x97xd0xbdxd1x81xd1x8cxd0xbaxd0xb0xe4xb8xadxe6x96x87 edit links  this page was last edited on 9 october 2016 at 19:11text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
