of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin the season has been hyperactive{1] featuring 17 named storms tying it with 1936 as the fifth-most active season since records began in 1851 the season also features both the highest total accumulated cyclone energy (ace) and the highest number of major hurricanes since the 2005 season all ten of the season's hurricanes occurred consecutively the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era in addition it is the costliest season on record with a preliminary total of over 31651 billion (usd) in damages nearly all of which was due to three of the season's major hurricanes xe2x80x94 harvey irma and maria this season is also one of only six years on record to feature multiple categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes irma's landfalls on multiple caribbean islands and maria's landfall on dominica make 2017 the second season on record (after 2007) to feature two hurricanes making landfall at categoryxc2xa05 intensity in addition irma was the strongest hurricane ever recorded to form in the atlantic ocean outside of the gulf of mexico and caribbean sea{2] this season is the only season on record in which three hurricanes each had an ace of over 40: irma jose and mariathe season officially began on junexc2xa01 and will end on novemberxc2xa030 these dates historically describe the period of year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin and are adopted by convention however as shown by tropical storm arlene in april the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at other times of the year arlene made 2017 the third consecutive year to feature a pre-season storm in mid-june tropical storm bret struck the island of trinidad which is only rarely struck by tropical cyclones due to its low latitude a few days later tropical storm cindy struck the state of louisiana in late august hurricane harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 while also setting the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record as well as the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the us in early september hurricane irma a cape verde-type hurricane became the first category 5xc2xa0hurricane to impact the northern leeward islands on record and in terms of maximum sustained winds is tied with the 1935 labor day hurricane as the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the atlantic basin the season also featured the fastest-moving tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico (nate) the season also featured ophelia the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record which later impacted most of northern europe while extratropicalinitial predictions for the season anticipated that an el nixc3xb1o would develop lowering storm activity however the predicted el nixc3xb1o failed to develop with cool-neutral conditions developing instead later progressing to a la nixc3xb1a xe2x80x93 the second one in a row this led to forecasters upgrading their predicted totals with some later anticipating that the season could be the most active since 2010beginning in 2017 the national hurricane center (nhc) has the option to issue advisories and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48xc2xa0hours such systems are termed "potential tropical cyclones" advisories on these storms contain the same content including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings as advisories on active tropical cyclones{3] the first storm to receive this designation was potential tropical cyclone two which later developed into tropical storm bret east-southeast of the windward islands on junexc2xa018{4] in addition the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season meaning that the next tropical system would be designated with the following number even though potential tropical cyclones do not qualify as tropical cyclones this was first demonstrated with potential tropical cyclone ten which failed to develop into a tropical cyclonecontents1 seasonal forecasts11 pre-season outlooks12 mid-season outlooks2 seasonal summary3 systems31 tropical storm arlene32 tropical storm bret33 tropical storm cindy34

activity17106 junexe2x80x93november onlyxe2x80xa0 most recent of several such occurrences (see all)ahead of and during the season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms hurricanes and major (categoryxc2xa03 or higher on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale) hurricanes will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies include the tropical storm risk (tsr) consortium of the university college london the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) and colorado state university (csu) the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year{6] some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the dissipation of the 2014xe2x80x9316 el nixc3xb1o event on average an atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms six hurricanes and two major hurricanes with an accumulated cyclone energy (ace) index of between 66 and 103xc2xa0units{5]pre-season outlooks{edit]the first forecast for the year was issued by tsr on december 13 2016{6] they anticipated that the 2017 season would be a near-average season with a prediction of 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes they also predicted an ace index of around 101xc2xa0units{6] on december 14 csu released a qualitative discussion detailing five possible scenarios for the 2017 season taking into account the state of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the possibility of el nixc3xb1o developing during the season{21] tsr lowered their forecast numbers on april 5 2017 to 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes based on recent trends favoring the development of el nixc3xb1o{7] the next day csu released their prediction also predicting a total of 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes{8] on april 17 the weather company released their forecasts calling for 2017 to be a near-average season with a total of 12 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes{9] the next day on april 18 north carolina state university released their prediction also predicting a near-average season with a total of 11xe2x80x9315 named storms 4xe2x80x936 hurricanes and 1xe2x80x933 major hurricanes{10] on may 20 the weather company issued an updated forecast raising their numbers to 14 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes to account for tropical storm arlene as well as the decreasing chance of el nixc3xb1o forming during the season{11] on may 25 noaa released their prediction citing a 70 chance of an above average season due to "a weak or nonexistent el nixc3xb1o" calling for 11xe2x80x9317 named storms 5xe2x80x939 hurricanes and 2xe2x80x934 major hurricanes{12] on may 26 tsr updated its prediction to around the same numbers as its december 2016 prediction with only a minor change in the expected ace index amount to 98xc2xa0units{13]mid-season outlooks{edit]csu updated their forecast on june 1 to include 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include tropical storm arlene{14] it was based on the current status of the north atlantic oscillation which was showing signs of leaning towards a negative phase favoring a warmer tropical atlantic; and the chances of el nixc3xb1o forming were significantly lower however they stressed on the uncertainty that the el nixc3xb1oxe2x80x93southern oscillation could be in a warm-neutral phase or weak el nixc3xb1o conditions by the peak of the season{14] on the same day the united kingdom met office (ukmo) released its forecast of a very slightly above-average season it predicted 13 named storms with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 10 and 16 and 8 hurricanes with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 6 and 10 it also predicted an ace index of 145 with a 70 chance that the index would be between 92 and 198{15] on july 4 tsr released their fourth forecast for the season increasing their predicted numbers to 17 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes due to the fact that el nixc3xb1o conditions would no longer develop by the peak of the season and the warming of sea-surface temperatures across the basin additionally they predicted a revised ace index of 116xc2xa0units{16] during august 9 noaa released their final outlook for the season raising their predictions to 14xe2x80x9319 named storms though retaining 5xe2x80x939 hurricanes and 2xe2x80x935 major hurricanes they also stated that the season had the potential to be extremely active possibly the most active since 2010{20]seasonal

land at the timethe atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2017 although activity began earlier for the third consecutive year since 2015 roughly a month before the official start the first storm arlene developed on april 19 in the northern atlantic ocean it was the first named storm to develop in the month of april since ana in 2003 in june two more tropical storms developed: bret which affected areas in the southeastern caribbean sea including trinidad and tobago and cindy which formed in the gulf of mexico less than a day after bret had developed in july a tropical depression developed in the main development region (mdr) the second tropical cyclone to develop in the mdr before the month of august after bret and was followed by tropical storm don at the end of that month a cold front stalled over the gulf of mexico and portions of the southeastern united states spawning tropical depression six which quickly developed into tropical storm emily{22]august featured the season's first hurricane franklin which formed in the bay of campeche a few days after franklin dissipated tropical storm gert formed northeast of the bahamas eventually becoming a hurricane at a high latitude over the western atlantic on august 17 tropical storm harvey formed east of the windward islands before opening up into a wave over the central caribbean three days later harvey then regenerated into a tropical depression over the southwestern gulf of mexico on august 23 and rapidly strengthened into a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane before making landfall near rockport texas late on august 25 harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 the first categoryxc2xa04 hurricane to make landfall in texas since carla in 1961 and the first categoryxc2xa04 hurricane landfall in the contiguous united states since charley in 2004{22]most intense atlantichurricane seasons(since 1850){nb

became the first year since 1998 in which six hurricanes have formed in a row{25] on september 17 maria became a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane threatening the same areas devastated by hurricane irma when lee intensified into a major hurricane on september 27 it became the first time in seven years that five major hurricanes formed activity briefly paused as september came to a close{citation

nicaragua nate strengthened to a hurricane on october 7 and made two landfalls in the united states as a category 1 hurricane - the first near the mouth of the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana late on october 7 and the second near biloxi mississippi early october 8 as nate became a post-tropical cyclone on october 9 tropical depression seventeen formed in the eastern subtropical atlantic strengthening into tropical storm ophelia that same day ophelia became a hurricane two days later marking the first time since 1893 that 10 consecutive named storms strengthened into hurricanes on october 14 ophelia unexpectedly strengthened into a major hurricane becoming the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record after this the basin went quiet for some time late in the month tropical storm philippe formed south of cuba tropical storm rina developed in the central atlantic in early november and did not impact any land areas{citation needed]the accumulated cyclone energy (ace) index for the 2017 atlantic hurricane season as of 09:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa09 is 22312xc2xa0units{nb 2] which is one of the highest values on record for an atlantic hurricane season as well as the most since 2005 and more than double the 1981xe2x80x932010 full-season median of 92 units ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39xc2xa0mph (63xc2xa0kmh) which is tropical storm strength with an ace value under 4xc2xa0units following the dissipation of emily 2017 set the record for lowest ace produced by a season's first five named storms{26] despite that the 2017 season hosted the storm with the third-highest ace value (hurricane irma at 666 units) and is one of only four seasons (including 1966 2003 and 2004) to have at least two hurricanes with an ace value over 40 and the only season to have had three{27] 2017 also hosted the day with the most ace produced (september 8) and currently has the fourth highest ace value of any atlantic season since 1950{22] september also generated the highest ace value for any month in the atlantic surpassing

from the surrounding environment and gradually losing its frontal characteristics deep convection formed in bands north and east of the center by 00:00xc2xa0utc on aprilxc2xa019 leading to the formation of a subtropical depression despite an unfavorable environment with ocean temperatures near 20xc2xa0xc2xb0c (68xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and moderate wind shear convection coalesced near the center and allowed the subtropical depression to become fully tropical by 00:00xc2xa0utc on aprilxc2xa020 it intensified into tropical storm arlene six hours later after attaining peak winds of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) the storm began to rotate around a larger extratropical low the storm tracked into the cold sector of the cyclone causing arlene to lose tropical characteristics around 12:00xc2xa0utc on aprilxc2xa021 the post-tropical cyclone moved south and east before dissipating well west-southwest of the azores on aprilxc2xa022{29]upon its formation as a subtropical depression on aprilxc2xa019 arlene was the sixth known subtropical or tropical cyclone to form in the month of april in the atlantic basin; the other instances were ana in 2003 a subtropical storm in april 1992 and three tropical depressions in 1912 1915 and 1973 respectively when arlene became a tropical storm on aprilxc2xa020 this marked only the second such occurrence on record after ana in 2003{30]{nb 3] furthermore it had the lowest central pressure of any atlantic storm recorded in the month of april with a central pressure of 990xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2923xc2xa0inhg) again surpassing ana{32] additionally unrelated to arlene tropical storm adrian in the eastern pacific basin also formed before the corresponding hurricane season was set to officially begin being the earliest named storm in the eastern pacific proper this makes 2017 the second consecutive year after 2016 where the first storms in both basins were pre-season storms{33]tropical storm bret{edit]tropical

moved off the coast of africa on june 13 and was first monitored by the national hurricane center shortly afterwards{34] development however was expected to be slow due to its low latitude and relatively fast motion as it moved swiftly across the main development region of the atlantic ocean the disturbance began to gradually organize and the nhc raised development chances slightly on june 16{35] little change in organization occurred until june 18 at which point a burst of convection near the center of the disturbance prompted the nhc to designate the system as potential tropical cyclone two at 21:00xc2xa0utc this was the agency's first designation of a disturbance that had not yet developed into a tropical cyclone{36] the storm continued to organize as it accelerated towards venezuela and trinidad and tobago throughout the night with banding features becoming evident later on june 19 the system developed a closed low-level circulation and was upgraded to tropical storm bret at 21:00xc2xa0utc{37] one day later at 21:00xc2xa0utc on june 20 the last advisory on bret was issued following its degeneration into a tropical wave{38]according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university bret was the earliest storm to form in the main development region on record surpassing a record set by tropical storm ana in 1979{39] bret was also the lowest latitude named storm in the month of june since 1933 at 94xc2xb0n{40] in trinidad one person died after he slipped and fell while running across a makeshift bridge; the fatality is considered indirectly related to bret{41]{42] another fatality occurred in tobago after a man's house collapsed on him; he eventually succumbed to his injuries a week later{43]tropical storm cindy{edit]tropical

monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the northwestern caribbean sea on junexc2xa013{44] a large area of disturbed weather developed within the region three days later{45] and it slowly organized while entering the central gulf of mexico prompting the nhc to begin advisories on a potential tropical cyclone on junexc2xa019 the structure of the system was initially sprawling with tropical storm-force winds well displaced from a broad area of low pressure with embedded swirls{46] a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system around 18:00xc2xa0utc the following day was able to pinpoint a well-defined center indicating the formation of tropical storm cindy{47] despite the presence of dry air and strong wind shear the cyclone still managed to attain peak winds of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) before weakening on approach to the louisiana coastline{48] it made landfall between port arthur texas and cameron louisiana early on junexc2xa022 and weakened while progressing inland{49]a state of emergency was declared for biloxi mississippi in anticipation of flooding a ten-year-old boy died from injuries sustained during the storm in fort morgan alabama{50] a

africa{52] the disturbance was introduced as a potential contender for tropical cyclone formation two days later as environmental conditions were expected to favor slow organization{53] it began to show signs of organization over the central atlantic early on julyxc2xa03{54] but the chances for development began to decrease two days later as the system moved toward a more stable environment{55] having already acquired a well-defined circulation the development of a persistent mass of deep convection around 03:00xc2xa0utc the following day prompted the nhc to upgrade the wave to tropical depression four located about 1545xc2xa0miles (2485xc2xa0km) east of the lesser antilles{56] despite wind shear being low the nascent depression struggled to intensify due to a dry environment caused by a saharan air layer to its east causing the low-level circulation to weaken and resulting in the tropical depression degenerating into an open tropical wave late on the next day{57]tropical storm

a low-pressure trough over the central atlantic as having the potential to develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming days{58] the disturbance began to show signs of organization early on julyxc2xa017{59] and data from a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system confirmed the development of tropical storm don around 21:00xc2xa0utc that day{60] the storm's overall appearance improved over subsequent hours up until around 09:00 utc as a central dense overcast accompanied by significant clusters of lightning became pronounced{61] don attained its peak intensity at this time characterised by winds of approximately 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh){61] the next plane to investigate the cyclone a few hours later however found that the system's center had become less defined and that sustained wind speeds had decreased to about 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh){62] a combination of reconnaissance data and surface observations from the windward islands indicated that don opened up into a tropical wave around 03:00xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa019 as it entered the eastern caribbean sea{63]tropical storm emily{edit]tropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationjuly 31xc2xa0xe2x80x93 august

development of an area of low pressure over the next day on julyxc2xa030 any development was expected to be slow due to land proximity and marginal upper-level winds{64] contrary to predictions a rapid period of organization occurred over the next 24 hours and the system was deemed as tropical depression six at 09:00xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa031{65] strengthening into tropical storm emily just two hours later after attaining its peak intensity with winds of 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 1005xc2xa0mbar (297xc2xa0inhg){66] emily made landfall on anna maria island around 14:45xc2xa0utc weakening quickly ensued and later that day the circulation of emily became elongated as it was downgraded to a tropical depression{67] the increasingly disrupted system later moved off the first coast of florida into the western atlantic early the next day accelerating northeastwards before becoming embedded within a frontal zone early on augustxc2xa02{68]following the classification of tropical storm emily florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency for 31xc2xa0counties to ensure residents were provided with the necessary resources{69] the storm

brought heavy rain and strong winds to the united kingdom and ireland on the night of november 10 and into the following day{236]rina's formation in november made 2017 the first season since 2013 to feature a named storm in every month of the season (june through november) rina was only the sixth storm to be given the "r" name in atlantic history and is the first r name to be used twice the first being hurricane rina in 2011{citation needed] rina was also the first atlantic "r"-named storm that did not intensify into a hurricane{citation needed]other systems{edit]potential tropical cyclone ten

chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours{237] the system reached sustained wind speeds of 45 miles per hour and affected the east coast however the system did not acquire any more tropical characteristics and it began to undergo an extratropical transition consequently the nhc issued its last advisory on the system at 21:00 utc on august 29 declaring the system to be an extratropical low{238]storm names{edit]main articles: tropical cyclone naming history of tropical cyclone naming and list of historic tropical cyclone namesthe following list of names will be used for
