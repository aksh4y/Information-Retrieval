for example 401875xc2xb0alternatively the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used one degree is divided into 60 minutes (of arc) and one minute into 60 seconds (of arc) use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called dms notation these subdivisions also called the arcminute and arcsecond are respectively represented by a single and double prime for example 401875xc2xb0 = 40xc2xb0 11xe2x80xb2 15xe2x80xb3 or using quotation mark characters 40xc2xb0 11' 15" additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds componentthe older system of thirds fourths etc which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by al-kashi and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denoted{citation needed] by writing the roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript: 1i for a "prime" (minute of arc) 1ii for a second 1iii for a third 1iv for a fourth etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word "second" also refer to this system{citation needed]alternative units{edit]see also: measuring anglesa chart to convert between degrees and radiansin most mathematical work beyond practical geometry angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees this is for a variety of reasons; for example the trigonometric functions have simpler and more "natural" properties when their arguments are expressed in radians these considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360 one complete turn (360xc2xb0) is equal to 2xcfx80 radians so 180xc2xb0 is equal to xcfx80 radians or equivalently the degree is a mathematical constant: 1xc2xb0 = xe2x80x8axcfx80xe2x81x84180the turn (or revolution full circle full rotation cycle) is used in technology and science one turn is equal to 360xc2xb0with the invention of the metric system based on powers of ten there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal "degrees"{note 3] called grad or gon where the number in a right angle is equal to 100xc2xa0gon with 400xc2xa0gon in a full circle (1xc2xb0 = xe2x80x8a10xe2x81x849 gon) although that idea was abandoned by napoleon grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them decigrades (xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x844000) were used with french artillery sights in world war ian angular mil which is most used in military applications has at least three specific variants ranging from xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x846400 to xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x846000 it is approximately equal to one milliradian (c xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x846283) a mil measuring xe2x80x8a1xe2x81x846000 of a revolution originated in the imperial russian army where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units this may be seen on a lining plane (an early device for aiming indirect fire artillery) dating from about 1900 in the st petersburg museum of artilleryconversion of common anglesturnsradiansdegreesgradians (gons)000xc2xb00g124xcfx801215xc2xb016xc2xa023g112xcfx80630xc2xb033xc2xa013g110xcfx80536xc2xb040g18xcfx80445xc2xb050g12xcfx801c 573xc2xb0c 637g16xcfx80360xc2xb066xc2xa023g152xcfx80572xc2xb080g14xcfx80290xc2xb0100g132xcfx803120xc2xb0133xc2xa013g254xcfx805144xc2xb0160g12xcfx80180xc2xb0200g343xcfx802270xc2xb0300g12xcfx80360xc2xb0400gsee also{edit]compassgeographic coordinate systemgradianmeridian arcsquare degreesquare minutesquare secondsteradiannotes{edit]^ the divisors of 360 are 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 18 20 24 30 36 40 45 60 72 90 120 180 and 360^ contrast this with the relatively unwieldy 2520 which is the least common multiple for every number from 1 to 10^ these new and decimal "degrees" must not be confused with decimal degreesreferences{edit]^ hpxc2xa048g series xe2x80x93 user's guide (ug) (8 ed) hewlett-packard december 1994 {1993] hp 00048-90126 (00048-90104) retrieved 2015-09-06xc2xa0^ hp 50g graphing calculator user's guide (ug) (1 ed) hewlett-packard 2006-04-01 hp f2229aa-90006 retrieved 2015-10-10xc2xa0^ hp prime graphing calculator user guide (ug) (pdf) (1 ed) hewlett-packard development company lp october 2014 hp 788996-001 retrieved 2015-10-13xc2xa0^ bureau international des poid et mesures (2006) "the international system of units (si)" (8 ed) archived from the original on 2009-10-01xc2xa0^ "degree" mathworldxc2xa0^ jeans james hopwood (1947) the growth of physical science pxc2xa07xc2xa0^ murnaghan francis dominic (1946) analytic geometry pxc2xa02xc2xa0^ rawlins dennis "on aristarchus" dio - the international journal of scientific historyxc2xa0^ toomer gerald j hipparchus and babylonian astronomyxc2xa0^ "2 (footnote 24)" aristarchos unbound: ancient vision  the hellenistic heliocentrists' colossal universe-scale  historians' colossal inversion of great  phony ancients  history-of-astronomy and the moon in retrograde!
