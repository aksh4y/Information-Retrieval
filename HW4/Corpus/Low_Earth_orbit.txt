hubble space telescope and iridium constellation orbits with the van allen radiation belts and the earth to scale{a] the moon's orbit is around 9 times larger than geostationary orbit{b] (in thexc2xa0svgxc2xa0file hover over an orbit or its label to highlight it; click to load its article)a low earth orbit (leo) is an orbit around earth with an altitude of 2000 kilometres (1200xc2xa0mi) or less and an orbital period of between about 84 and 127 minutes objects below approximately 160 kilometres (99xc2xa0mi) will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss due to atmospheric drag{1]{2]with the exception of the 24 astronauts who flew lunar flights in the apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972 all human spaceflights have taken place in leo or below the international space station conducts operations in leo the altitude record for a human spaceflight in leo was gemini 11 with an apogee of 13741 kilometres (8538xc2xa0mi) all crewed space stations to date as well as the majority of satellites have been in leocontents1 orbital characteristics2 use of leo21 examples3 space debris4 see also5 notes6 referencesorbital characteristics{edit]objects in leo encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere (approximately 80xe2x80x93500xc2xa0km up) or exosphere (approximately 500xc2xa0km and up) depending on orbit height due to atmospheric drag satellites do not usually orbit below 300xc2xa0km objects in leo orbit earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner van allen radiation beltgoce orbited at about 255 km and had an aerodynamic shape and ion thrusters to reduce and compensate for atmospheric dragthe mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low earth orbit is about 78xc2xa0kms but reduces with increased orbital altitude calculated for circular orbit of 200xc2xa0km it is 779xc2xa0kms and for 1500xc2xa0km it is 712xc2xa0kms{3] the delta-v needed to achieve low earth orbit starts around 94xc2xa0kms atmospheric and gravity drag associated with launch typically adds 13xe2x80x9318xc2xa0kms to the launch vehicle delta-v required to reach normal leo orbital velocity of around 78xc2xa0kms (28080xc2xa0kmh){4]equatorial low earth orbits (eleo) are a subset of leo these orbits with low inclination to the equator allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest delta-v requirement (ie fuel spend) of any orbit orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called polar orbitshigher orbits include medium earth orbit (meo) sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ico) and further above geostationary orbit (geo) orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulationuse of leo{edit]play mediaroughly half an orbit of the issalthough the earth's pull due to gravity in leo is not much less than on the surface of the earth people and objects in orbit experience weightlessness because they are in free falla low earth orbit is simplest and cheapest for satellite placement it provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag (latency) but satellites in leo will not be visible from any given point on the earth at all times{5]examples{edit]earth observation satellites and spy satellites use leo as they are able to see the surface of the earth more clearly as they are not so far away they are also able to traverse the surface of the earth a majority of artificial satellites are placed in leo{6] making one complete revolution around the earth in about 90 minutesthe international space station is in a leo about 400xc2xa0km (250xc2xa0mi) above earth's surface{7] and needs reboosting a few times a year due to orbital decaysince it requires less energy to place a satellite into a leo and the leo satellite needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission leo is used for many communication applications because these leo orbits are not geostationary a network (or "constellation") of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage (many communication satellites require geostationary orbits and move at the same angular velocity as the earth some communications satellites including the iridium phone system use leo)lower orbits also aid remote sensing satellites because of the added detail that can be gained remote sensing satellites can also take advantage of sun-synchronous leo orbits at an altitude of about 800xc2xa0km (500xc2xa0mi) and near polar inclination envisat is one example of an earth observation satellite that makes use of this particular type of leogoce orbited at about 255xc2xa0km (158xc2xa0mi) to measure earth's gravity fieldthe hubble space telescope orbits at about 540xc2xa0km (340xc2xa0mi) above earthspace debris{edit]the leo environment is becoming congested with space debris due to the frequency of object launches this has caused growing concern in recent years since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous and even deadly collisions can produce even more space debris in the process creating a domino effect something known as kessler syndrome the joint space operations center part of united states strategic command (formerly the united states space command) currently tracks more than 8500 objects larger than 10xc2xa0cm in leo{8] however a limited arecibo observatory study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters{9] which are too small to be visible from earth-based observatories{10]see also{edit]spaceflight portalastronomy portalsolar system portalspace portalvan allen radiation beltlist of orbitsmedium earth orbit (meo)high earth orbit (heo)highly elliptical
