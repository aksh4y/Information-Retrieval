see for instance andagoya colombia) but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest (as at palembang indonesia) or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain (as at sitiawan malaysia)(note the term aseasonal refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or ground water plant response (e g phenology) animal (feeding migration reproduction etc) and human activities (plant sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc) are tuned to this 'seasonality' indeed in tropical south america and central america the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called invierno or inverno though it could occur in the northern hemisphere summer; likewise the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called verano or verxc3xa3o and can occur in the northern hemisphere winter)tropical monsoon climate{edit]main article: tropical monsoon climatethis type of climate results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with rainfall less than 60xc2xa0mm but more than 125 the total annual precipitation{1]:200xe2x80x931:208cities featuring a tropical monsoon climate abidjan ivory coast (am) cairns queensland australia (am){2] chittagong bangladesh (am) coatzacoalcos mexico (am) conakry guinea (am) douala cameroon (am) freetown sierre leone (am) guanare venezuela (am) huxe1xbaxbf thxe1xbbxaba thixc3xaanxe2x80x93huxe1xbaxbf vietnam (am) jakarta indonesia (am) kochi india (am) libreville gabon (am) macapxc3xa1 amapxc3xa1 brazil (am) malxc3xa9 maldives (am) miami florida united states (am) monrovia liberia (am) port harcourt rivers state nigeria (am) puerto ayacucho venezuela (am) qionghai city china (am) san juan puerto rico (am) santo domingo dominican republic (am) yangon myanmar (am)tropical wet and dry or savanna climate{edit]main article: tropical savanna climateaw climates have a pronounced dry season with the driest month having precipitation less than 60xc2xa0mm and less than 125 of the total annual precipitation{1]:208xe2x80x9311examples abuja nigeria (aw) accra ghana (aw) asuncixc3xb3n paraguay (aw bordering on cfa) bamako mali (aw) bangkok thailand (aw) barquisimeto venezuela (aw) brasxc3xadlia brazil (aw) brazzaville republic of the congo (aw) cali colombia (aw) cancxc3xban mexico (aw) caracas venezuela (aw) cartagena colombia (aw) chennai tamil nadu india (aw) dar es salaam tanzania (aw) darwin northern territory australia (aw) dhaka bangladesh (aw) dili east timor (aw) guatemala city guatemala (aw) guayaquil ecuador (aw) havana cuba (aw bordering on am) ho chi minh city vietnam (aw) kano nigeria (aw) katherine northern territory australia (aw) kaohsiung taiwan (aw) key west florida united states (aw) kigali rwanda (aw) kingston jamaica (aw) kinshasa democratic republic of congo (aw) kolkata west bengal india (aw) kumasi ghana (aw) kupang indonesia (aw) lagos lagos state nigeria (aw) maputo mozambique (aw) mumbai maharashtra india (aw) naples florida united states (aw) panamxc3xa1 city panamxc3xa1 (aw) phnom penh cambodia (aw) port-au-prince haiti (aw) ribeirxc3xa3o preto sxc3xa3o paulo brazil (aw) rio de janeiro brazil (aw bordering on am) santa cruz de la sierra bolivia (aw) sanya hainan china (aw) veracruz veracruz mexico (aw) yaoundxc3xa9 cameroon (aw)most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the tropical zone from the low teens to the mid-20s latitudes but occasionally an inner-tropical location (eg san marcos antioquia colombia) also qualifies actually the caribbean coast eastward from the gulf of urabxc3xa1 on the colombiaxe2x80x93panamxc3xa1 border to the orinoco river delta on the atlantic ocean (about 4000xc2xa0km) have long dry periods (the extreme is the bsh climate (see below) characterised by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the guajira and coro western venezuela the northernmost peninsulas in south america which receive <300xc2xa0mm total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months)this condition extends to the lesser antilles and greater antilles forming the circum-caribbean dry belt the length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward);

descent (positive values) is more diffusebecause of the effect of sun angle on climate most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the tropical rain belt or intertropical convergence zone (itcz) a portion of the hadley cell the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall; areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with geographical variations and in some areas (india) is heavily influenced by local large-scale monsoonssee also{edit]tropical ecologytropical vegetationtropicsreferences{edit]^ a b mcknight tom l;
