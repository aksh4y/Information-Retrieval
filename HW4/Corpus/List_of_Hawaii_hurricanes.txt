b'list of hawaii hurricanes - wikipedia list of hawaii hurricanesfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchcategory 4 hurricane iniki hawaii's most notable hurricanea hawaiian hurricane is a tropical cyclone that forms in the pacific ocean and affects the hawaiian islands hawaii lies in the central pacific where about four or five tropical cyclones appear each year although as many as fifteen have occurred such as in the 2015 season; rarely do these storms actually affect hawaii tropical cyclone records were not kept before the 1950s earlier windstorms that struck hawaii were not labeled as hurricanes{1]contents1 list of tropical cyclones11 prexe2x80x93195012 1950s13 1960s14 1970s15 1980s16 1990s17 2000s18 2010s2 monthly statistics and landfalls3 deadliest storms4 hawaii's apparent immunity to most hurricanes5 see also6 references7 external linkslist of tropical cyclones{edit]tracks of all the tropical cyclones to affect hawaixcaxbbi since 1949this list contains every tropical cyclone that had a somewhat notable effect on the state of hawaixcaxbbiprexe2x80x931950{edit]september 1843: the earliest report of a tropical cyclone that could have affected hawaixcaxbbi was made in 1843 on september 23 a german ship recorded a cyclone (known later as the "cyclone of the lark") near 17xc2xb0n and 141xc2xb0w no further records are available but extrapolation of its forward movement predicted that it would make landfall on the southern coast of the big island of hawaixcaxbbi{2]august 1871: excerpts from a honolulu newsletter known as the hawaiian gazette described an august weather event that at least resembled a tropical cyclone quotes from captains and civilians describe a severe windstorm that ravaged the islands for several hours damage is unrecorded{2]november 1874: in november a possible tropical cyclone may have dropped over 20 inches (510xc2xa0mm) of rain on honolulu and southerly gales destroyed 23 homes and damaged at least 50{2]december 1902xe2x80x9303: a low pressure system (known later as "the froc cyclone") that took a path similar to that of a tropical cyclone passed through kaulakahi channel in late december 1902 no records of unusual weather were recorded so the storm was likely still forming as it crossed hawaixcaxbbi{3]october 1906: in october a tropical cyclone passed about 60 miles (97xc2xa0km) south of south point heavy rains were recorded; "the heaviest in years" a little over 12 inches (300xc2xa0mm) fell in 4xc2xbdxc2xa0hours{3]november 1906: 90 miles (140xc2xa0km) south of honolulu on november 3 1906 a tropical cyclone was recognized the storm supposedly tracked northward passing through the kauai channel this cyclone must have been abnormally small or very weak because climatological records show no unusual rainfall wind surge or low pressure the storm dissipated near british columbia{3]august 1925: in august high seas and gusty winds were recorded in hawaixcaxbbi from a nearby tropical cyclone{3]august 1938: again in august a possible tropical cyclone produced heavy wind and rain in the state{3]1950s{edit]august 1950: hurricane hiki passed north of the islands bringing gale winds 68xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) winds were recorded in kauai additionally over 52xc2xa0inches (1321xc2xa0mm) of rain fell over 4xc2xa0days in kauai one person died from hiki{3]july 1957: hurricane kanoa after taking a long journey across the eastern pacific became a non-tropical circulation a few miles east of hawaixcaxbbi the remnants of kanoa brought welcomed rain{4]november 1957: hurricane nina was a category 1 hurricane that formed in november south of hawaixcaxbbi nina moved north and took a sharp turn to the west without actually striking the state nina's closest approach to land which was relatively far off the coast was only about 120 miles (190xc2xa0km) southwest of kauai nina caused about 100000 damage in kauai and dropped over 20 inches (510xc2xa0mm) of rain in 14xc2xa0hours nina set a record for the highest wind gust ever recorded in honolulu: 82 miles per hour (132xc2xa0kmh) nina killed four people throughout the islands{4]august 1958: on august 7 a tropical storm seemed to rapidly appear directly off the coast of hilo it moved across the islands dropping considerable rainfall and causing about 500000 of damage before dissipating{5]august 1959: hurricane dot was another powerful august arrival dot entered the central pacific as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane just south of hawaixcaxbbi on august 5 dot seemed to turn more northwest aiming it directly at kauai on the 6th dot began weakening and at its landfall in kauai dot was only a category 1 hurricane despite being greatly weakened the hurricane brought gusts of over 100 miles per hour (160xc2xa0kmh) in some areas of the island palm trees snapped in half suggesting winds were locally over 125 miles per hour (201xc2xa0kmh) damages from dot cost no more than a few million dollars and rainfall was relatively light; around 4 inches (100xc2xa0mm) no dot-related deaths were recorded{6]1960s{edit]september 1963: tropical storm irah crossed the islands as a tropical depression bringing 36 miles per hour (58xc2xa0kmh) winds but caused little damage{7]august 1966: hurricane connie brought heavy rain to big island and maui without making landfall{8]1970s{edit]tropical storm maggieaugust 1970: tropical storm maggie passed just south of the big island dropping nearly 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) of rain{9]january 1971: although not having existed in the central pacific as a tropical cyclone the extratropical low that was tropical storm sarah in the west pacific passed over hawaixcaxbbi in mid january causing high winds and heavy rain{10]july 1971: hurricane denise dissipated before reaching hawaixcaxbbi but brought beneficial rain of over one inch to dry farms and sugarcane plantations denise's outer winds helped sheila scott while she was flying solo around the world and a boat named winward passage win the transpacific yacht race both were headed to honolulu{10]august 1972: hurricane diana dissipated a few miles off shore of the big island dropping over

power across the islands{13]1980s{edit]hurricane uleki near hawaii and peak strengthjuly 1982: hurricane daniel passed through the islands as a tropical depression causing little if any damage{14]november 1982: hurricane iwa was one of hawaii's most damaging hurricanes although it was only a category 1 storm it passed just miles west of kauai moving at a speed of nearly 50 miles per hour (80xc2xa0kmh) severe property damage was inflicted on the island; up to 7008250000000000000xe2x99xa0250xc2xa0million (a record for that time) iwa was the most damaging hurricane to ever hit hawaixcaxbbi until hurricane iniki took over the title 10xc2xa0years later{14]julyxe2x80x93august 1983: hurricane gil passed over northern hawaixcaxbbi as a tropical storm causing minor damage{15]october 1983: hurricane raymond took a path similar to gil's but as a depression causing no damage{15]july 1985: hurricane ignacio although missing the islands generated surf that measured from 10 to 15 feet (30 to 46xc2xa0m) causing damage to coastal roads and structures only light rain was reported{16]july 1986: waves caused by hurricane estelle caused 7006200000000000000xe2x99xa02xc2xa0million in damage when they destroyed five houses and damaged several others two people on oxcaxbbahu drowned in rough surf{17]august 1988: tropical storm gilma

180 xc2xb0 w) generally travel from east to west however some including hurricanes iwa (1982) and iniki (1992) track in a northerly directionthe islands of hawaii with kauai as the notable exception appear to be remarkably immune from direct hurricane hits the usgs states that "more commonly near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands"{31] this has also drawn media attention{32]{33] one notion is that hawaiixe2x80x99s volcanic peaks slow down or divert storms{34] a partial source of this idea may be the long list of hurricanes in the above paragraphs that dissipated into tropical storms or depressions upon approaching the islands satellite images of hurricane flossie's breakup when approaching hawaii island fueled this idea{35] another example may be hurricane felicia which dropped from category 4 down to a tropical depression with residual winds predicted at only 35 miles per hour (56xc2xa0kmh){36]snow on mauna loa and mauna kea after storm passes hawaii islandtropical storm flossie (not to be confused with hurricane flossie in 2007) provides still another example on july 28 2013 the storm appeared headed for a direct hit to the big island home to mauna kea and mauna loa both mountains rise to elevations in excess of 13000 feet above sea level and as flossie approached the island its track shifted abruptly overnight and assumed a more northerly alignment heading instead to the island of maui on july 29{37]wind data in particular supports the usgs assertion that hurricane damage has been low on all islands except for kauai data collected by the western regional climate center show no hurricane-strength winds on any hawaii islands with the exception of kauai{38] despite this data fema classified all of hawaii as being in a "wind-borne debris region"{39]{40]{41]before hurricane iniki in 1992 a standard homeowner's insurance policy with extended coverage provided hurricane coverage since iniki many insurance policies exclude hurricane and a separate hurricane policy is required to obtain hurricane coveragesee also{edit]central
