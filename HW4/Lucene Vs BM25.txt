Analyzing the top 5 results for each query generated by Lucene's simple analyzer and by BM25 respectively, it can be seen that the results are not the same.
While there is overlap between some results, there is a noticable difference between the results of both. Lucene makes gives max preference to the title of the documents in the corpus to generate its highest ranking documents while BM25 on the other hand makes use of term frequency of the query in the documents. BM25 thus generates a better result due to this key difference between the two. Of course this is not always the case. The corpus decides which technology would work better but in our case BM25 produces better results.
