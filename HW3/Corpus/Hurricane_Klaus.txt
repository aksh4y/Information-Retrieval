the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by tropical storm marco due to the damage caused by the storm the name klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone namescontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact4 retirement5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 27 it tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge becoming convectively active and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the cape verde islands on september 28 the organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression as it approached the lesser antilles it organized further and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into tropical depression thirteen on october 3 while located about 115xc2xa0miles (185xc2xa0kmh) east of dominica located in an area of weak steering currents the depression drifted to the northwest and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the national hurricane center designated it with the name klaus{1]upon becoming a tropical storm klaus was located in an area of 29xc2xa0mph (47xc2xa0kmh) of wind shear although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 831xc2xa0xc2xb0f (284xc2xa0xc2xb0c){2] tracking through a highly baroclinic environment{3] the storm became better organized and at 1200xc2xa0utc on october 5 klaus attained hurricane status about 30xc2xa0miles (50xc2xa0km) east of antigua; shortly thereafter it passed 12xc2xa0miles (19xc2xa0km) east of barbuda its closest point of approach to the lesser antilles klaus reached peak winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum central pressure of 9850xc2xa0mbar (2909xc2xa0inhg) though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear{1] at the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest however after weakening to a tropical storm on october 6 klaus turned westward{3]klaus continued tracking just north of the lesser antilles and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on october 8 to the north of puerto rico later that day convection redeveloped over the center and klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast bahamas; it briefly reached winds of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh){1] a low pressure area to its west over cuba had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface and on october 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system eventually becoming marco and klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on october 9 the remnant moisture continued to the northwest reaching the coast of south carolina by october 11{4]preparations{edit]shortly after klaus attained tropical storm status early on october 4 a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern leeward islands from saint martin to antigua which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally the government of france issued a tropical storm warning for guadeloupe a hurricane watch was issued for the virgin islands though it was dropped as klaus began to weaken{5] in guadeloupe officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas and also to avoid potentially flooded areas prior to its arrival schools were closed in martinique{6] sint maarten and antigua the vc bird international airport was closed during the passage of the hurricane{7]later in its duration the government of the bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern bahamas though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated{5] due to hurricane klaus space shuttle columbia's launch was delayedimpact{edit]hurricane klaus dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the lesser antilles potentially as high as 15xc2xa0inches (380xc2xa0mm); the hurricane affected many areas struck by hurricane hugo in the previous year on barbados flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few families to move to safer areas; lightning from the outskirts of the storm left a portion of the island without power{6] high winds and rainfall affected the island of saint lucia which destroyed about 15 of the nation's banana crop for the year; damage totaled about 1xc2xa0million (1990xc2xa0usd){8]the rainfall resulted in severe flooding on martinique which accrued to almost 10xc2xa0feet (3xc2xa0m) in some locations; two sisters drowned near saint-joseph after a bridge was washed away{6] several landslides were reported on the island{9] the passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems 750xc2xa0people evacuated their homes in le lamentin due to flooding{6] and a total of 1500xc2xa0residents were left homeless on the island{7] offshore rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel leaving its two passengers drifting on the boat for 25xc2xa0days before being rescued about 640xc2xa0miles (1035xc2xa0km) to the north-northwest of martinique{10] in all seven people were killed on the island{11]on dominica winds from the hurricane damaged power lines and downed trees in the northern portion of the island{6] high winds on antigua damaged a few roofs and also downed communications from two radio networks{7] the outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall on the united states virgin islands reaching about 125xc2xa0inches (32xc2xa0mm) on saint thomas; wind gusts peaked at 33xc2xa0mph (53xc2xa0kmh) on saint croix{12] moderate rainfall continued into the turks and caicos islands with grand turk reporting a total of 4xc2xa0inches (100xc2xa0mm) in 36xc2xa0hours{4]on the east coast of florida klaus produced 15xc2xa0foot (45xc2xa0m) waves and tides of 3xc2xa0feet (1xc2xa0m) above normal beach erosion was reported along the east coast due to persistent easterly winds{13] as the remnant moisture of klaus entered the southeastern united states it produced heavy rainfall between 10xe2x80x9315xc2xa0inches (250xe2x80x93380xc2xa0mm) of rainfall in south carolina with slightly lower totals in north carolina in south carolina the rainfall caused a dam to burst killing four people{4] about two days after the remnants of klaus entered the southeastern united states tropical storm marco made landfall on northwestern florida dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region{14]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdue to its impact on martinique the government of france requested the retirement of the name klaus; the world meteorological organization retired the name from the list of tropical cyclone names in the following year and replaced it with the name kyle{15]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of retired atlantic hurricane nameslist of north carolina hurricanes (1980xe2x80x93present)references{edit]^ a b c national hurricane center (1990) "hurricane klaus preliminary report" retrieved 2007-10-31xc2xa0^ mark demaria;
