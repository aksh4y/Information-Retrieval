the worst being philadelphia considering that kyle rote jr had joined the hurricane that season it must have been a disappointment in any case rote left the hurricane on a relief mission to cambodia and later retiredthe hurricane didn't do as well in what turned out to be their final season placing second in the division and again losing in the playoffs versus the edmonton drillers they won fourteen and lost eighteen in the expanded schedule and attendance fell to 5818 a match with only the atlanta chiefs and again philadelphia being the only teams with worse gates that was enough for the hurricane's owners (who were actually based in denver colorado) and the team folded in late 1980year-by-year{edit]yearleaguewlptsreg seasonplayoffsattendance1978nasl1020964th american conference central divisiondid not qualify77501979nasl2281871st american conference central divisionlost conference quarterfinal (philadelphia)62121979xe2x80x9380nasl indoordid not enter1980nasl14181302nd american conference central divisionlost 1st round (edmonton)5818external links{edit]houston hurricane on funwhileitlastednetreferences{edit]^ conway joe (january 30 2006) "can 1836 be a hit where other soccer teams have missed?" houston chronicle retrieved september 20 2014xc2xa0^ "nasl honors houston coach" salina journal salina kansas august 26 1979xc2xa0 access-date= requires url= (help)vtenorth american soccer league (1968xe2x80x9384)broadcastersussfcsaportalcontemporary naslseasonsusa 1967npsl 19671968196919701971 indoor19711972197319741975 indoor19751976 indoor1976197719781979 indoor19791979-80 indoor19801980-81 indoor19811981-82 indoor19821983 indoor19831983-84 indoor1984associatedcompetitionssoccer bowl (nasl championship)nasl indoor championshipclubsatlanta chiefsbaltimore baysbaltimore cometsboston beaconsboston minutemenboston roverscalgary boomerscalifornia surfchicago mustangschicago spurschicago stingcleveland stokerscaribous of coloradoconnecticut bicentennialsdallas tornadodenver dynamosdetroit cougarsdetroit expressedmonton drillersfort lauderdale strikersteam hawaiihouston hurricanehouston starsjacksonville tea menkansas city spurslas vegas quicksilverslos angeles aztecslos angeles wolvesmemphis roguesmiami torosminnesota kicksminnesota strikersmontreal manicmontreal olympiquenew england tea mennew york cosmosnew york generalsnew york skylinersoakland clippersoakland stompersphiladelphia spartansphiladelphia atomsphiladelphia furypittsburgh phantomsportland timbersrochester lancerssan antonio thundersan diego jawssan diego sockerssan diego torossan francisco golden gate galessan jose earthquakesseattle soundersst louis starstampa bay rowdiesteam americatoronto blizzardtoronto citytoronto falconstulsa roughnecksvancouver royalsvancouver whitecapswashington dartswashington diplomatswashington whipsthis article about a soccer club from texas is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding itvtethis houston-related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding itvte retrieved from ""categories: north american soccer league (1968xe2x80x9384)north american soccer league (1968xe2x80x9384) teamsdefunct soccer clubs in texassoccer clubs in houston1978 establishments in texas1980 disestablishments in texasassociation football clubs established in 1978association football clubs disestablished in 1980southern united states soccer club stubstexas sports team stubshouston stubshidden categories: pages using citations with accessdate and no urlarticles needing additional references from august 2014all articles needing additional referencespages using deprecated image syntaxfootball team templates which use american parameterall stub articles navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagesespaxc3xb1olitalianonederlandspolski edit links  this page was last edited on 2 october 2017 at 17:39text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
