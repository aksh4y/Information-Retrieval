is said to do work if when acting there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force for example when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement)work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to anotherthe term work was introduced in 1826 by the french mathematician gaspard-gustave coriolis{1]{2] as "weight lifted through a height" which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of

linksunits{edit]the si unit of work is the joule (j) which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a displacement of one metrethe dimensionally equivalent newton-metre (nxe2x8bx85m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre which is the measurement unit of torque usage of nxe2x8bx85m is discouraged by the si authority since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement or a measurement of work{3]non-si units of work include the erg the foot-pound the foot-poundal the kilowatt hour the litre-atmosphere and the horsepower-hour due to work having the same physical dimension as heat occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content such as therm btu and calorie are utilized as a measuring unitwork and energy{edit]the work w{displaystyle w} done by a constant force of magnitude f{displaystyle f} on a point that moves a displacement s{displaystyle s} in a straight line in the direction of the force is the productw=fs{displaystyle w=fs}for example if a force of 10 newtons (f{displaystyle f} = 10 n) acts along a point that travels 2 meters (s{displaystyle s} = 2 m) then it does the work w{displaystyle w} = (10 n)(2 m) = 20 n m = 20 j this is approximately the work done lifting a 1xc2xa0kg weight from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravity notice that the work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distancework is closely related to energy the work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body conversely a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant forcefrom newton's second law it can be shown that work on a free (no fields) rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body is equal to the change in kinetic energy ke{displaystyle ke} of the velocity and rotation of that bodyw=xcex94ke{displaystyle w=delta ke}the work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservative therefore work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field without change in velocity or rotation is equal to minus the change of potential energy pe{displaystyle pe} of the objectw=xe2x88x92xcex94pe{displaystyle w=-delta pe}these formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions and units of energy the workenergy principles discussed here are identical to electric workenergy principlesconstraint forces{edit]constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system constraining the object within a boundary (in the case of a slope plus gravity the object is stuck to the slope when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter') constraint forces ensure the velocity in the direction of the constraint is zero which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the systemif the system doesn't change in time{4] they eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force due to this force this only applies for a single particle system for example in an atwood machine the rope does work on each body but keeping always the net virtual work null there are however cases where this is not true{4]for example the centripetal force exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle this force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ballanother example is a book on a table if external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards the force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform workthe magnetic force on a charged particle is f = qv xc3x97 b where q is the charge v is the velocity of the particle and b is the magnetic field the result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors so f xe2x8axa5 v the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero so the work w = f xe2x8bx85 v = 0 and the magnetic force does not do work it can change the direction of motion but never change the speedmathematical calculation{edit]for moving objects the quantity of worktime (power) is calculated thus at any instant the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joulessecond or watts) is the scalar product of the force (a vector) and the velocity vector of the point of application this scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance by the fundamental theorem of calculus the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application{5]work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a displacement as the point moves it follows a curve x with a velocity v at each instant the small amount of work xcexb4w that occurs over an instant of time dt is calculated asxcexb4w=fxe2x8bx85ds=fxe2x8bx85vdt{displaystyle delta w=mathbf {f} cdot dmathbf {s} =mathbf {f} cdot mathbf {v} dt}where the f xe2x8bx85 v is the power over the instant dt the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the

{dmathbf {s} }{dt}}dt=int _{c}mathbf {f} cdot dmathbf {s} }where c is the trajectory from x(t1) to x(t2) this integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle and is therefore said to be path dependentif the force is always directed along this line and the magnitude of the force is f then this integral simplifies tow=xe2x88xabcfds{displaystyle w=int _{c}fds}where s is displacement along the line if f is constant in addition to being directed along the line then the integral simplifies further tow=xe2x88xabcfds=fxe2x88xabcds=fs{displaystyle w=int _{c}fds=fint _{c}ds=fs}where s is the displacement of the point along the linethis calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line followed by the particle in this case the dot product f xe2x8bx85 ds = f cos xcexb8 ds where xcexb8 is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement{5] that isw=xe2x88xabcfxe2x8bx85ds=fscosxe2x81xa1xcexb8{displaystyle w=int _{c}mathbf {f} cdot dmathbf {s} =fscos heta }in the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90xc2xb0 from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force) no work is done at all since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero thus no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal as all orbits are slightly elliptical) also no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifugework done by a variable force{edit]calculating the work as "force times straight path segment" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances as noted above if force is changing or if the body is moving along a curved path possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work (positive work when in the same direction and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity) this component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called scalar tangential component (fcosxe2x81xa1xcexb8{displaystyle scriptstyle fcos heta } where xcexb8{displaystyle scriptstyle heta } is the angle between the force and the velocity) and then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application pointif the force varies (eg compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done if the force is given by f(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is:w=xe2x88xababf(s)xe2x8bx85ds{displaystyle

of these forces may cancel but their effect on the body is the couple or torque t the work of the torque is calculated asdw=txe2x8bx85xcfx89xe2x86x92dt{displaystyle dw=mathbf {t} cdot {vec {omega

velocity xcfx89 that varies with time and is therefore said to be path dependentif the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction then it takes the formxcfx89xe2x86x92=xcfx95xcbx99s{displaystyle {vec {omega }}={dot {phi }}mathbf {s} }where xcfx86 is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector s in this case the work of the torque

trajectory xcfx86(t) and is therefore path-dependentif the torque t is aligned with the angular velocity vector so thatt=xcfx84s{displaystyle mathbf {t} =au mathbf {s} }and both the torque and angular velocity are constant then the work takes the form{6]w=xe2x88xabt1t2xcfx84xcfx95xcbx99dt=xcfx84(xcfx952xe2x88x92xcfx951){displaystyle w=int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}au {dot {phi }}dt=au (phi _{2}-phi _{1})}a force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever armthis result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude f being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance r as shown in the figure this force will act through the distance along the circular arc s = rxcfx86 so the work done isw=fs=frxcfx95{displaystyle

velocity vector contributes to the workwork and potential energy{edit]the scalar product of a force f and the velocity v of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application c = x(t) defines the work input to the system by the forcepath dependence{edit]therefore the work done by a force f on an object that travels along a curve c is given by the line integral:w=xe2x88xabcfxe2x8bx85dx=xe2x88xabt1t2fxe2x8bx85vdt{displaystyle w=int _{c}mathbf {f} cdot dmathbf {x} =int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}mathbf {f} cdot mathbf {v} dt}where dx(t) defines the trajectory c and v is the velocity along this trajectory in general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependentthe time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous powerdwdt=p(t)=fxe2x8bx85v{displaystyle {frac {dw}{dt}}=p(t)=mathbf {f} cdot mathbf {v} }path independence{edit]if the work for an applied force is independent of the path then the work done by the force is by the gradient theorem the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application such a force is said to be conservative this means that there is a potential function u(x) that can be evaluated at the two points x(t1) and x(t2) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points it is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential that

w=-abla u=-left({frac {partial u}{partial x}}{frac {partial u}{partial y}}{frac {partial u}{partial z}}right)=mathbf {f} }and the force f is said to be "derivable from a potential"{7]because the potential u defines a force f at every point x in space the set of forces is called a force field the power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work or potential in the direction of the velocity v of the body that isp(t)=xe2x88x92xe2x88x87uxe2x8bx85v=fxe2x8bx85v{displaystyle p(t)=-abla ucdot mathbf {v} =mathbf {f} cdot mathbf {v} }work by gravity{edit]gravity f = mg does work w = mgh along any descending pathin the absence of other forces gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object near earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is g = 98xc2xa0mxe2x8bx85sxe2x88x922 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is fg = mg it is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of

the workxe2x80x93energy principle begins with newtonxe2x80x99s second law of motion and the resultant force on a particle computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system{9]constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force this also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power the time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration the fact the workxe2x80x93energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies lagrangian mechanics{10]this section focuses on the workxe2x80x93energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics in more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device the thermal energy in a thermal system or the electrical energy in an electrical device work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to anotherderivation for a particle moving along a straight line{edit]in the case the resultant force f is constant in both magnitude and direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the particle is moving with constant acceleration a along a straight line{11] the relation between the

in the preceding rectilinear casederivation for a particle in constrained movement{edit]in particle dynamics a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of newton's second law of motion it is useful to notice that the resultant force used in newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle remarkably the work of a constraint force is zero therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the workxe2x80x93energy principleto
