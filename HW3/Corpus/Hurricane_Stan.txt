atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane stan was a rather weak but deadly tropical cyclone that affected areas of central america in early october 2005 the eighteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season stan formed from a tropical wave on octoberxc2xa01 after it had moved into the western caribbean sea the depression slowly intensified and reached tropical storm intensity the following day before subsequently making its first landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula traversing the peninsula the tropical storm weakened but was able to re-intensify once it entered the bay of campeche under favorable conditions for tropical development stan attained hurricane strength on octoberxc2xa04 and later reached peak intensity with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum barometric pressure of 977xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2885xc2xa0inhg) the hurricane maintained this intensity until landfall near punta roca partida mexico later the same day once over the mountainous terrain of mexico however stan quickly weakened and dissipated on octoberxc2xa05due to stan's position within a large area of convective activity and thunderstorms the hurricane's effects were far-reaching and widespread across central america flash floods generated by the hurricane caused severe crop losses particularly to coffee crops overall stan caused at least 1668xc2xa0deaths across six countries with many others unaccounted for most of these fatalities occurred in guatemala and were mostly caused by mudslides triggered by torrential rainfall the floods in guatemala destroyed entire towns and disrupted exportation of petroleum in mexico the heavy rains triggered additional mudslides and caused rivers to overflow flooding nearby villages despite being relatively far from stan as opposed to other countries el salvador was also severely affected by the hurricane the santa ana volcano erupted while stan was producing heavy rains in the country which contributed to the damage already wrought by mudslides transportation in the country was disrupted across the region stan caused 39xc2xa0billion in damages primarily due to torrential rainfallcontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 mexico32 honduras33 guatemala34 el salvador4 retirement5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalehurricane stan originated from a tropical wave that was first identified by the national hurricane center (nhc) off the west coast of africa on septemberxc2xa017 2005 traveling westward the wave remained weak barely being notable by septemberxc2xa022 convection began to increase; however wind shear in the region prevented this development from continuing the system entered the caribbean sea several days later a region with more favorable conditions for cyclonic development intermittent convection formed around the wave as it moved west-northwestward before the development maintained itself{1] on octoberxc2xa01 the system had become sufficiently organized for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression twenty{2] with the center of circulation situated roughly 135xc2xa0mi (215xc2xa0km) southeast of cozumel mexico{1]located to the south of a low to mid-level tropospheric ridge the depression tracked towards the west-northwest within a few hours of being warned upon the system further intensified into tropical storm stan{1] this followed the development of a strong convective banding feature to the southeast of the storm's center{3] around 1000xc2xa0utc (5xc2xa0am cdt) on octoberxc2xa02 stan made its first landfall near punta hualaxtoc mexico roughly 35xc2xa0mi (55xc2xa0km) south of tulum with winds of 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh){1] over the following 18xc2xa0hours the weak storm traversed the southern portion of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula upon entering the gulf of mexico on octoberxc2xa03 stan had weakened to a tropical depression;{1] however convection began to redevelop over the storm's center{4] allowing the system to re-attain tropical storm status{1]tropical rainfall measuring mission estimate of rainfall from hurricane stan; september 29xc2xa0xe2x80x93 october 5a strong area of high pressure over the western gulf of mexico forced the storm to turn southwestward back to the mexican coastline{1] increasingly deep cloud cover formed over the storm in response to a favorable environment over the bay of campeche late on octoberxc2xa03 forecasters at national hurricane center noted a statistical rapid intensity index indicating a 49 chance of stan undergoing rapid intensification before its final landfall{5] this intensification did take place within 12xc2xa0hours before the hurricane moved onshore overnight the structure of stan rapidly improved with a banding eye-feature developing within unusually deep convection with cloud-top temperatures measured at xe2x88x9290xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x92130xc2xa0xc2xb0f) by infrared satellites{6] following this development national hurricane center upgraded the storm to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale around 1200xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa04 stan made landfall near punta roca partida with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) the storm also attained its lowest barometric pressure of 977xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2885xc2xa0inhg)at this time not long after moving over the mountainous terrain of central mexico stan rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and fully dissipated early on octoberxc2xa05 over the state of oaxaca{1]preparations{edit]some 100000 inhabitants of the sierra de los tuxtlas region on the gulf coast were evacuated from their homes and incidents of mild flooding as well as wind damage (such as uprooted trees and roofs ripped off houses) were reported from coastal areas of veracruz including the port of veracruz boca del rxc3xado san andrxc3xa9s tuxtla santiago tuxtla minatitlxc3xa1n and coatzacoalcos as well as state capital xalapa further inland the armed forces evacuated the inhabitants of a dozen

mud slides and crop damage (particularly to the coffee crop which was close to harvest) over portions of mexico and central america including guatemala el salvador nicaragua honduras and costa rica most of the rainstorms were non-tropical in nature and impossible to relate to the hurricane; however the impact of the larger weather system can be considered as a wholehundreds were reported missing and were feared dead throughout the region one estimate put the death toll above 2000 in guatemala alone the final death toll will likely never be known due to the extensive decomposition of bodies in the mud note that only 80-100 of the deaths were estimated to have been as a result of stan; the rest were not caused by stan itself but were the result of the large system of non-tropical rains that had spawned the hurricane{8]most of the reported fatalities were as a result of the flooding and mudslides although eight of the deaths in nicaragua were as a result of a boat carrying migrants from ecuador and peru that ran ashore a large portion of the figure comes from one village alone as a mudslide completely destroyed the village of panabaj in guatemala's sololxc3xa1 departmentmexico{edit]as a tropical storm stan brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the yucatan peninsula flash flooding took place in several areas; however no loss of life was reported{9]hurricane stan making landfall in veracruzas the system progressed inland towards the sierra madre del sur to the west of the isthmus of tehuantepec the states of oaxaca and chiapas were affected with torrential rains areas of chiapas near the guatemalan border were hit hard particularly the coastal border town of tapachula in tapachula the river overflowed its banks and caused tremendous damage (including the destruction of all the bridges leading in and out of the town) meaning that it was only accessible through the air the state government reported that 33 rivers broke their banks and that an indeterminate number of homes upwards of 20 bridges and other infrastructure were smashed in the storm's wakesome areas in the sierra norte in the central state of puebla were also flooded three people died in a mudslide at xochiapulco hillin addition pemex evacuated 270 employees from its oil platforms in the gulf of mexico although no damage was reported and the plants were restartedthe ministry of the interior declared states of emergency in the worst hit municipalities of five states: chiapas hidalgo oaxaca puebla and veracruz according to mexican president vicente fox hurricane stan wrought roughly 20xc2xa0billion pesos (19xc2xa0billion usd) in damage throughout the country{10]honduras{edit]throughout honduras heavy rains produced by hurricane stan resulted in six fatalities and roughly 100xc2xa0million in losses{7]guatemala{edit]landslides affecting infrastructure crops and water sources in guatemalaby october 11 2005 at least 1500 people were confirmed to have died and up to 3000 were believed missing many communities were overwhelmed and the worst single incident appears to have occurred in panabaj an impoverished maya village in the highlands near lake atitlxc3xa1n in sololxc3xa1 department this volcanic lake was so overwhelmed by the torrential rains that many of the small mayan villages covering the shores experienced landslides from above some of the towns were so overwhelmed by the slides that the mayor has declared them graveyards and all people who are missing are counted as dead piedra grande a hamlet in the municipality of san pedro sacatepxc3xa9quez was also destroyed floods and mudslides obliterated the community of about 1400 people and it was feared that most or all of the population of the community lost their lives the government stated that it did not know what was going on in the southwest of the country and particularly in the san marcos department because a vital bridge was destroyed at el palmar quetzaltenango cutting the region off from the rest of the country there were reported petrol shortages including in quetzaltenangoel salvador{edit]the eruption of the santa ana volcano located near the capital san salvador on october 1 2005 compounded the problems which led to even more destructive floods and mudslides from stana state of emergency was declared according to the director of el salvador's national emergency centre 300 communities were affected by the floods with over 54000 people forced to flee their homes a state of emergency also was called for in guatemala by president xc3x93scar berger where 36559 people were reported in emergency shelters some looting was also reported a scene reminiscent of hurricane katrina five weeks previousa spokesman for the salvadoran red cross said that "the emergency is bigger than the rescue capacity we have floods everywhere bridges about to collapse landslides and dozens of roads blocked by mudslides" the pan-american highway was cut off by mudslides leading into the capital san salvador as well as several other roads 72 deaths were confirmed in el salvadorretirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane
