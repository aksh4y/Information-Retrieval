energetics (the science of energy) and "pure" "abstract" or "rigid" dynamics (the science of momentum) according to villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations and rigid dynamics by vector equations in this division the dimensions for dynamics are space time and mass and for energetics length time and mass (villamil 1928 pxc2xa09) this division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies eg:are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?in villamil's classification system dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2 whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2 therefore in villamil's system dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate and consequently must all be at zero kelvin the conservation of momentum is a consequence of this view however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (villamil pxc2xa096) in contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together and thus are free to vibrate and consequently can be at non-zero temperaturestheories of energetics{edit]ecological analysis of co2 in an ecosystemas a general statement of energy flows under transformation the principles of energetics include the first four laws of thermodynamics which seek a rigorous description however the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate if the ecologist howard t odum was right the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms which aims to account for the concept of energy quality and the evolution of the universe albert lehninger (1973 pxc2xa02) called these hierarchical orderings the successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological macrocosmodum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take energy hierarchy into account the first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of thermodynamics and are expanded upon in that articlesee also{edit]energy economicsindustrial ecologynatural capitaleconophysicssustainabilityenvironmental scienceecological economicsthermoeconomicsreferences{edit]s w angrist and l g helper (1973) order and chaos: laws of energy and entropy penguin australia pxc2xa034g helm (1898) die energetik leipzigm giampietro k mayumi and a sorman (dec 2011) the energetics of modern societies springer heidelbergh r hertz (1899) the principles of mechanics presented in a new form london: macmillan;
