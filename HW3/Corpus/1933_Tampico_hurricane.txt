however the system was very weak and the island reported east winds of only 12xc2xa0mph (19xc2xa0kmh) after entering the caribbean sea the depression intensified into a tropical storm on septemberxc2xa018 and a day later it became a hurricane on septemberxc2xa020 it passed to the south of jamaica while quickly strengthening at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa021 a ship in the eye reported a barometric pressure of 929xc2xa0mbar (274xc2xa0inhg) ordinarily the pressure reading would suggest winds of 153xc2xa0mph (246xc2xa0kmh); however observations from the ship indicated the hurricane was smaller than normal with a radius of maximum winds of 8xc2xa0mi (13xc2xa0km) as a result the peak winds were estimated at 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) or a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{3]after peaking in intensity the hurricane continued to the northwest early on septemberxc2xa022 it passed about 50xc2xa0mi (80xc2xa0km){nb 2] south of cozumel before making landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{3]{4] its landfall intensity was unknown; the atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2012 suggested that the storm could have retained categoryxc2xa05 status until landfall although local observations did not validate the theory in the original analysis of the season the landfall intensity was estimated at 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) as a compromise the 2012 reanalysis estimated the hurricane struck land with winds of 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) the cyclone rapidly weakened while crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and on septemberxc2xa023 it emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) it quickly reintensified into a hurricane while moving toward the northeast mexican coastline at around 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa025 the hurricane made its final landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas with winds of 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh); this was based on a ship in the eye reporting a pressure of 960xc2xa0mbar (28xc2xa0inhg) within 12xc2xa0hours the storm dissipated over land{3]impact{edit]while passing south of jamaica the hurricane produced high surf in kingston{4] heavy rains from the storm affected much of the island which disrupted travel and caused one mudslide{5] in cozumel offshore the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula winds reached 76xc2xa0mph (122xc2xa0kmh) from the southeast{3] there the hurricane destroyed a fishing pier and several houses{6] while the storm crossed the peninsula progreso yucatxc3xa1n reported east winds of 55xc2xa0mph (89xc2xa0kmh){3] offshore progreso the storm capsized a boat killing one person{6]before the hurricane made its final landfall the threat of heavy rainfall prompted evacuations around tampico{6] just 10xc2xa0days after another hurricane hit the same region{4] near tampico a ship reported winds of 81xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) and a station in tampico recorded winds of 53xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh){3] high winds cut power lines and blew off or heavily damaged the roofs of half of the city's houses{7]{8] a high accompanying storm surge washed away many people from their homes{7]{9] and several barges were washed away{8] the harbor was filled with debris after the storm rendering it unusable{10] portions of the city were flooded up to 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) deep{11] according to news reports the hurricane damaged about 75 of tampico{7] majority of the damage was to poorly constructed houses{8] although a large hospital in tampico was also destroyed{12] killing 87xc2xa0people{13] roads were blocked throughout the city and the river was closed to boating{8] the rail line was impacted which disrupted relief supplies from reaching the region{10] outside of the city the hurricane increased levels along the pxc3xa1nuco and tamesxc3xad rivers{11] which remained above flood stage for several days{14] west of tampico the hurricane flooded the entire city of cxc3xa1rdenas san luis potosxc3xad killing 20 and injuring 200xc2xa0people{8] in pxc3xa1nuco veracruz about 5000xc2xa0people were left homeless{10] in san luis potosxc3xad state 30xc2xa0people were killed when a dam burst heavy rainfall in monterrey caused rivers to flood damage spread as far as the west coast of mexico{12] throughout the country air travel was disrupted and several train lines were washed out{8] leaving three trains missing{12]initial news reports suggested a death toll of up to 5000xc2xa0people and the storm was considered "the greatest disaster in recent mexican history"{7] two days after the storm dissipated the death toll was set at 54 with 850xc2xa0people injured and potentially thousands that were buried{10] search and rescue teams dug through the debris of the tampico to find survivors and victims{15] in 1997 the national hurricane center listed the death toll between 184xe2x80x93200{16] and damage was estimated at 5xc2xa0million (1933xc2xa0usd){9]in the aftermath of the storm food and medical supplies rapidly diminished{10] after the storm dissipated doctors and nurses traveled to the city to assist in the aftermath while trains carried food and water{7] a train from monterrey to tampico carried food medicine and soldiers to assist in rebuilding but was delayed by ongoing flooding{14] military planes were utilized to transport aid{13] martial law was declared in tampico following the storm and officials imposed a 7 pm curfew uninjured citizens helped clear the roads president abelardo l rodrxc3xadguez asked the governors of the mexican states to send aid and for residents to send money to the bank of mexico{8] following the storm residents overcrowded the buildings that remained standing in tampico{17]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneshurricane deanhurricane emily (2005)hurricane gilbertnotes{edit]^ the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale was developed in 1971{1] and has been retroactively applied to the entirety of the atlantic hurricane database{2]^ the 1933 monthly weather review reported that the hurricane passed "about 40xc2xa0miles south of cozumel island"{4] and the 2012 atlantic hurricane reanalysis wrote that the "center passed about 10xc2xa0nmi farther south of cozumel than previously analyzed"{3]references{edit]^ jack williams (2005-05-17) "hurricane scale invented to communicate storm danger" usa today retrieved 2013-08-04xc2xa0^ chronological list of all continental united states hurricanes: 1851-2012 (report) hurricane research division june 2013 retrieved 2013-08-03xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g chris landsea;
