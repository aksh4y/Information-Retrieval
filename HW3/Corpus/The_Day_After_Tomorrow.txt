citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (march 2015) (learn how and when to remove this template message)the day after tomorrow was inspired by coast to coast am talk-radio host art bell and whitley strieber's book the coming global superstorm{3] and strieber wrote the film's novelization arnold federbush's 1978 novel ice! and douglas orgill and john gribbin's the sixth winter (published in 1979) have similar themes before and during the film's release members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing the possible effects of global warming although the film depicts effects of global warming predicted by scientists (such as rising sea levels more destructive storms and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns) it depicts their occurrence more rapidly and severely than what is considered scientifically plausible; the theory that a superstorm could create rapid worldwide climate change does not appear in the scientific literature{citation needed]to choose a studio writer michael wimer created an auction a copy of the script was sent to all major studios along with a term sheet they had 24 hours to decide whether to produce the movie with roland emmerich directing fox studios was the only studio to accept the terms{4]visual effects{edit]the day after tomorrow is well-known for its special effects and cgi the movie features 416 visual effects shots with nine effects houses and over 1000 artists working on the film for over a year to bring its disaster sequences to life{5]reception{edit]box office{edit]the film ranked 2 at the box office (behind shrek 2) over its four-day memorial day opening grossing 85807341 led the per-theater average with a four-day average of 25053 (compared to shrek 2's four-day average of 22633) at the end of its theatrical run the film grossed 186740799 domestically and 544272402 worldwide it was the second-highest opening-weekend film not to lead at the box office; inside out surpassed it in june 2015{1]critical reaction{edit]the day after tomorrow received mixed reviews from critics who praised its visual effects and criticized its writing and scientific inaccuracy review aggregator rotten tomatoes rated the film at 45 with an average rating of 53 out of 10 according to the website it is "a ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster"{6] roger ebert of the chicago sun-times described the film as "profoundly silly" but nonetheless said the film was effective and praised the special effects he gave it three stars out of four{7]awards and

jaegernominatedpolitical and scientific criticism{edit]emmerich did not deny that his casting of a weak president and the resemblance of vice-president kenneth welsh to dick cheney were intended to criticize the climate change policy of the george w bush administration{8] responding to claims of insensitivity in his inclusion of scenes of a devastated new york city less than three years after the september 11 attacks emmerich said that it was necessary to showcase the increased unity of people in the face of disaster because of the attacks{9]{10]{11]some scientists criticized the film's scientific aspects paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at harvard university daniel p schrag said "on the one hand i'm glad that there's a big-budget movie about something as critical as climate change on the other i'm concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke  we are indeed experimenting with the earth in a way that hasn't been done for millions of years but you're not going to see another ice age xe2x80x93 at least not like that"{8] j marshall shepherd a research meteorologist at the nasa goddard space flight center expressed a similar sentiment: "i'm heartened that there's a movie addressing real climate issues but as for the science of the movie i'd give it a d minus or an f and i'd be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda"{8] according to university of victoria climatologist andrew weaver "it's the towering inferno of climate science movies but i'm not losing any sleep over a new ice age because it's impossible"{8]patrick j michaels a former research professor of environmental science at the university of virginia who rejects the scientific consensus{12] on global warming called the film "propaganda" in a usa today editorial: "as a scientist i bristle when lies dressed up as 'science' are used to influence political discourse"{13] college instructor and retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz called the day after tomorrow "a cheap thrill ride which many weak-minded people will jump on and stay on for the rest of their lives" in a space daily editorial{14]when paleoclimatologist william hyde of duke university was asked on usenet if he would see the film he answered that he would not unless someone offered him 100{15] subscribers to the newsgroup took up the challenge and despite hyde's protests raised the 100{16] hyde's review on google groups criticized the film's depiction of weather which stopped at national borders; it was "to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery"{17]stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research an expert on thermohaline circulation and its effect on climate said after a talk with scriptwriter jeffrey nachmanoff at the film's berlin preview:"clearly this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary {and] the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license but the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right: humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes  luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades (ixe2x80x99d be just as surprised as jack hall if they did occur); at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century and the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the 'superstorm' depicted in the movie nevertheless a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences which we should avoid and even without events like ocean circulation changes climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action"{18]environmental activist and guardian columnist george monbiot called the day after tomorrow "a great movie and lousy science"{19]in 2008 yahoo! movies listed the day after tomorrow as one of its top-10 scientifically inaccurate films{20] it was criticized for depicting meteorological phenomena as occurring over the course of hours instead of decades or centuries{21] a 2015 washington post article reported on a paper published in nature scientific reports which indicated that global temperatures could drop relatively rapidly due to a temporary shutdown of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation caused by global warming{22]home media{edit] the film was released on vhs and dvd october 12 2004 and was released in high-definition video on blu-ray in north america on october 2 2007 and in the united kingdom on april 28 2008 in 1080p with a lossless
