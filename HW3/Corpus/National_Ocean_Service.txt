research scientific information and tools to help balance the nation's ecological social and economic goals the research and tools provided are central to addressing coastal issues raised in legislation and noaa's priorities{5] nccos was formed within the national ocean service (nos) in march 1999 as the focal point for coastal ocean science research areas and strategy were selected in response to federal legislation stakeholder input and in concert with scientific expertise and capabilities nccos has five centers with specific capabilities and research expertise in coastal and ocean issues three of the centers are dedicated research laboratories another conducts research through analyses of field data and one funds research with competitive grantscenter for coastal

following offices:marine chart divisionhydrographic surveys divisionnavigation services divisioncoast survey development laboffice for coastal management{edit]established in 2014 when noaa combined two offices: the coastal services center and the office of ocean and coastal resource management in addition to implementing specific initiatives a top priority for noaa's office for coastal management is to unify efforts to make communities more resilient many organizations are involved including the private sector nonprofits the scientific community and all levels of government the office for coastal management works to be a unifying force in these efforts providing unbiased noaa data and tools and providing opportunities for the community to come together to define common goals and find ways to work smarter by working together issues run the gamut from protecting endangered species to erosion to generating better building codes for storm-resistant buildings{7] the ocm has four programs:coastal zone management{edit]the national coastal zone management program comprehensively addresses the nationxe2x80x99s coastal issues through a voluntary partnership between the federal government and coastal and great lakes states and territories authorized by the coastal zone management act of 1972 the program provides the basis for protecting restoring and responsibly developing our nationxe2x80x99s diverse coastal communities and resources currently 34 coastal states participate while state partners must follow basic requirements the program also gives states the flexibility to design unique programs that best address their coastal challenges and regulations by leveraging both federal and state expertise and resources the program strengthens the capabilities of each to address coastal issues{19]coral reef conservation program (crcp){edit]noaa's coral reef conservation program (crcp) is a cross-cutting program that brings together expertise from a wide array of noaa programs and offices in strong partnership with coral reef managers the crcp works to reduce harm to and restore the health of coral reefs including deep-water corals by addressing priority national threats and local management priorities through conservation activities the crcp was established in 2000 to help fulfill noaa's responsibilities under the coral reef conservation act of 2000 (crca) and the presidential executive order 13089 on coral reef protection the goal of the crcp is to protect conserve and restore coral reef resources by maintaining healthy ecosystem function the primary objective of the crcp is to address strategic coral reef management needs in a targeted cost-effective and efficient manner crcp funds and equips reef conservation activities by noaa and its partners in the seven us states and jurisdictions containing coral reefs (american samoa the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands florida guam hawai`i puerto rico and the us virgin islands) uninhabited islands including the northwestern hawaiian islands and pacific remote island areas and internationally including the pacific freely associated states{20]digital

coast partnership whose members represent the websitexe2x80x99s primary user groups keeps the effort focused on customer needs{21]national estuarine research reserves{edit]the national estuarine research reserve system is a network of 28 coastal sites designated to protect and study estuarine systems established through the coastal zone management act the reserves represent a partnership program between noaa and the coastal states noaa provides funding and national guidance and each site is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university with input from local partners{22]office of national geodetic survey{edit]the office of national geodetic survey (ngs) provides the framework for all positioning activities in the nation the foundational elements - latitude longitude elevation shoreline information and their changes over time - contribute to informed decision making and impact a wide range of important activities including mapping and charting navigation flood risk determination transportation land use and ecosystem management ngs' authoritative spatial data models and tools are vital for the protection and management of natural and manmade resources and support the economic prosperity and environmental health of the nation{8] the ngs consists of six divisions:geodetic services: provides a direct relationship between ngs and its customers through the state advisor program geodetic equipment testing and evaluation product evaluation marketing distribution and various training programsspatial reference systems: maintains the continuously operating reference station (cors) network and plans coordinates and provides technical guidance for geodetic field projects and products required to preserve and develop the national

support this mandate erd provides 24-hour 7 day a week response to spill events find out more about erd's work with oil and chemical spills{27]assessment and restoration division{edit]the assessment and restoration division (ard) formerly coastal protection and restoration division (cprd) is responsible for evaluating and restoring coastal and estuarine habitats damaged by hazardous waste releases oil spills and vessel groundings to fully accomplish this mission ard joined with noaa's general counsel for natural resources and office of habitat conservation to create the damage assessment remediation and restoration program (darrp) this successful noaa partnership tackles the challenges of environmental damages to ensure marine natural resources are protected and restored the assessment and restoration division comprises noaa biologists toxicologists ecologists policy analysts information specialists attorneys geologists environmental engineers and economists together they help assess ecological risk and environmental and economic injury from contamination and ship groundings in particular ard has developed specific expertise in aquatic risk assessment techniques contaminated sediment issues and data interpretation{28]the ard publishes the screening quick reference tables (squirt cards) for rapid evaluation of water sediment and soil contamination{29]marine debris division{edit]since 2005 the noaa marine debris program has served as a centralized program within noaa coordinating strengthening and promoting marine debris activities within the agency and among its partners and the public the noaa marine debris program undertakes national and international efforts focused on researching reducing and preventing debris in the marine environment the program continues to support and work closely with various partners across the us to fulfill its mission{30]integrated ocean observing system program{edit]the integrated ocean observing system (ioos) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety enhance the economy and protect our environment integrated ocean information is now available in near real time as well as retrospectively easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms wave heights and sea level change
