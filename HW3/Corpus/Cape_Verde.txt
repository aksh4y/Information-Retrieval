spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central atlantic ocean located 570 kilometres (350xc2xa0mi) west of the cape verde peninsula in west africa the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4000 square kilometres (1500xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi)the cape verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century when portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands establishing the first european settlement in the tropics ideally located for the atlantic slave trade the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries attracting merchants privateers and pirates the end of slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration cape verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes incorporated as an overseas department of portugal in 1951 the islands continued to agitate for independence which was peacefully achieved in 1975since the early 1990s cape verde has been a stable representative democracy and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in africa lacking natural resources its developing economy is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment its population of around 512000 is mostly of mixed european north africanberber moorish and sub-saharan african heritage and predominantly roman catholic reflecting the legacy of portuguese rule a sizeable diaspora community exists across the world slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islandshistorically the name "cape verde" has been used in english for the archipelago and since independence in 1975 for the country in 2013 the cape verdean government determined that the portuguese designation cabo verde would henceforth be used for official purposes such as at the united nations even in english contexts cape verde is a member of the african unioncontents1 etymology2 history21 independence (1975)3 politics31 foreign relations32 military33 international

portuguese explorers had named that landmark as cabo verde a few years before they discovered the islands (verde is portuguese for "green")on 24 october 2013 the country's delegation announced at the united nations that the official name should no longer be translated into other languages instead of "cape verde" the designation "republic of cabo verde" is to be used{9]{11]history{edit]main article: history of cape verdeinsulae capitis viridis (1598) showing cape verdebefore the arrival of europeans the cape verde islands were uninhabited{12] the islands of the cape verde archipelago were discovered by genoese and portuguese navigators around 1456 according to portuguese official records{13] the first discoveries were made by genoa-born antxc3xb3nio de noli who was afterwards appointed governor of cape verde by portuguese king afonso v other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries in the cape verde archipelago are diogo gomes (who was with antxc3xb3nio de noli and claimed to have been the first to land on and name santiago island) diogo dias diogo afonso and the italian (venice-born) alvise cadamostoin 1462 portuguese settlers arrived at santiago and founded a settlement they called ribeira grande (now called cidade velha to avoid being confused with the town of ribeira grande on the santo antxc3xa3o island) ribeira grande was the first permanent european settlement in the tropics{14]a view of monte cara from mindeloin the 16th century the archipelago prospered from the atlantic slave trade{14] pirates occasionally attacked the portuguese settlements sir francis drake an english corsair privateering under a letter of marque granted by the english crown twice sacked the (then) capital ribeira grande in 1585 when it was a part of the iberian union{14] after a french attack in 1712 the town declined in importance relative to nearby praia which became the capital in 1770{14]decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis cape verde's early prosperity slowly vanished however the islands' position astride mid-atlantic shipping lanes made cape verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships because of its excellent harbour the city of mindelo located on the island of sxc3xa3o vicente became an important commercial centre during the 19th century{14] diplomat edmund roberts visited cape verde in 1832{15]grain ship "garthpool" wrecked at boavista cape verde in 1928with few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the portuguese the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters who nevertheless refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy in 1951 portugal changed cape verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing nationalism in 1956 amxc3xadlcar cabral and a group of fellow cape verdeans and guineans organised (in portuguese guinea) the clandestine african party for the independence of guinea and cape verde (paigc){14]it demanded improvement in economic social and political conditions in cape verde and portuguese guinea and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement moving its headquarters to conakry guinea in 1960 the paigc began an armed rebellion against portugal in 1961 acts of sabotage eventually grew into a war in portuguese guinea that pitted 10000 soviet bloc-supported paigc soldiers against 35000 portuguese and african troops{14]by 1972 the paigc controlled much of portuguese guinea despite the presence of the portuguese troops but the organization did not attempt to disrupt portuguese control in cape verde portuguese guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted de jure independence in 1974 a budding independence movementxc2xa0xe2x80x94 originally led by amxc3xadlcar cabral assassinated in 1973xc2xa0xe2x80x94 passed on to his half-brother luxc3xads cabral and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975independence (1975){edit]amxc3xadlcar cabral on a stamp of the former gdrfollowing the april 1974 revolution in portugal the paigc became an active political movement in cape verde in december 1974 the paigc and portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of portuguese and cape verdeans on 30 june 1975 cape verdeans elected a national assembly which received the instruments of independence from portugal on 5 july 1975{14] in the late 1970s and 1980s most african countries prohibited south african airways from overflights but cape verde allowed them and became a centre of activity for the airline's flights to europe and the united statesimmediately following the november 1980 coup in guinea-bissau relations between cape verde and guinea-bissau became strained cape verde abandoned its hope for unity with guinea-bissau and formed the african party for the independence of cape verde (paicv) problems have since been resolved and relations between the countries are good the paicv and its predecessor established a one-party system and ruled cape verde from independence until 1990{14]responding to growing pressure for pluralistic democracy the paicv called an emergency congress in february 1990 to discuss proposed constitutional changes to end one-party rule opposition groups came together to form the movement for democracy (mpd) in praia in april 1990 together they campaigned for the right to contest the presidential election scheduled for december 1990the one-party state was abolished 28 september 1990 and the first multi-party elections were held in january 1991 the mpd won a majority of the seats in the national assembly and mpd presidential candidate antxc3xb3nio mascarenhas monteiro defeated the paicv's candidate with 735 of the votes legislative elections in december 1995 increased the mpd majority in the national assembly the party won 50 of the national assembly's 72 seatsa february 1996 presidential election returned president monteiro to office legislative elections in january 2001 returned power to the paicv with the paicv holding 40 of the national assembly seats mpd 30 and party for democratic convergence (pcd) and

atlantic ocean approximately 570 kilometres (350xc2xa0mi) off the western coast of the african continent near senegal the gambia and mauritania and is part of the macaronesia ecoregion it lies between latitudes 14xc2xb0 and 18xc2xb0n and longitudes 22xc2xb0 and 26xc2xb0wthe country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands (nine inhabited) and eight islets{27] that constitute an area of 4033xc2xa0km2{27]the islands are spatially divided into two groups:the barlavento islands (windward islands): santo antxc3xa3o sxc3xa3o vicente santa luzia sxc3xa3o nicolau sal boa vista;{27] andthe sotavento islands (leeward): maio santiago fogo brava{27]the largest island both in size and population is santiago which hosts the nation's capital praia the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago{27]three of the cape verde islands sal boa vista and maio are fairly flat sandy and dry; the others are generally rockier with more vegetationphysical geography and geology{edit]geologically the islands covering a combined area of slightly over 4033 square kilometres (1557 square miles) are principally composed of igneous rocks with volcanic structures and pyroclastic debris comprising the majority of the archipelago's total volume the volcanic and plutonic rocks are distinctly basic; the archipelago is a soda-alkaline petrographic province with a petrologic succession similar to that found in other macaronesian islandsmagnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125xe2x80x93150 million years: the islands themselves date from 8 million (in the west) to 20 million years (in the east){28] the oldest exposed rocks occurred on maio and northern peninsula of santiago and are 128xe2x80x93131 million year old pillow lavas the first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early miocene and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes historical volcanism (within human settlement) has been restricted to the island of fogothe origin of the islands' volcanism has been attributed to a hotspot associated with bathymetric swell that formed the cape verde rise{29] the rise is one of the largest protuberances in the world's oceans rising 22 kilometres (14 miles) in a semi-circular region of 1200xc2xa0km2 associated with a rise of the geoid and elevated surface heat flow{28]most recently erupting in 2014 pico do fogo is the largest active volcano in the region it has a 8 kilometres (5 miles) diameter caldera whose rim is 1600 metres (5249 feet) altitude and an interior cone that rises to 2829 metres (9281 feet) above sea level the caldera resulted from subsidence following the partial evacuation (eruption) of the magma chamber along a cylindrical column from within magma chamber (at a depth of 8 kilometres (5 miles))extensive salt flats are found on sal and maio{27] on santiago santo antxc3xa3o and sxc3xa3o nicolau arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains{27] ocean cliffs have been formed by catastrophic debris landslides{30]according to the president of nauru cape verde has been ranked the eighth most endangered nation due to flooding from climate change{31]geography of cape verdethe beach of calhau

grande valley in santiagoclimate{edit]further information: geography of cape verde xc2xa7xc2xa0climatecape verde's climate is milder than that of the african mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands and cold atlantic currents produce an arid atmosphere around the archipelago conversely the islands do not receive the upwellings (cold streams) that affect the west african coast so the air temperature is cooler than in senegal but the sea is warmer because the orographic relief of some islands such as santiago with steep mountains cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants rocks soil logs moss etc on the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands exclusively in mountainous areas like santo antxc3xa3o island the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest and laurel forest as this vegetation{27] average daily high temperatures range from 26xc2xa0xc2xb0c (79xc2xa0xc2xb0f) in february to 31xc2xa0xc2xb0c (878xc2xa0xc2xb0f) in september{32] cape verde is part of the sahelian arid belt with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby west africa{27] it rains irregularly between august and october with frequent brief heavy downpours{27] a desert is usually defined as terrain that receives less than 250xc2xa0mm (98xc2xa0in) of annual rainfall sal's
