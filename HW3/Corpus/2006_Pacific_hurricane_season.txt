national hurricane center (nhc) area of warning responsibility which is east of 140xc2xb0w and one storm formed between 140xc2xb0w and the international date line which is under the jurisdiction of the central pacific hurricane center (cphc) of the 19xc2xa0total storms eleven became hurricanes of which six attained major hurricane status within the nhc portion of the basin the season officially began on may 15 and in the cphc portion it started on june 1; the season officially ended on november 30 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern pacific basinthe strongest storm of the season was hurricane ioke which reached category 5 status on the saffir-simpson scale in the central pacific ocean; ioke passed near johnston atoll and later wake island where it caused heavy damage but no deaths the deadliest storm of the season was hurricane john which killed six people after striking the baja california peninsula and the costliest storm was hurricane lane which caused 203xc2xa0million in damage in southwestern mexico (2006xc2xa0usd 241xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd)seasonal activity began on may 27 when tropical storm aletta formed off the southwest coast of mexico no storms formed in june though the season became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season as well as tropical storm emilia during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane three storms developed in october including hurricane paul and two formed in november; this marked the second time on record after 1961 when more than one tropical storm

pacific hurricane seasons the pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995 which generally increased wind shear across the basin noaa predicted a below-normal level of activity in the eastern pacific with 12xe2x80x9316xc2xa0named storms of which 6xe2x80x938 were expected to become hurricanes and 1xe2x80x933 expected to become major hurricanes{3] the central pacific hurricane center's area of responsibility was also expected to be below average with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area{4] they expected that neither el nixc3xb1o nor la nixc3xb1a would affect conditions significantly{3]on may 15 the hurricane season began in the eastern pacific basin which is the area of the northern pacific ocean east of 140xc2xb0w{5] on june 1 the season began in the central pacific warning zone (between 140xc2xb0w and the international dateline); however no storms occurred in the region until july{6]seasonal summary{edit]main article: timeline of the 2006 pacific hurricane seasonno tropical storms developed in june in the basin which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month since 1966 there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in june these being 1969 2004 and 2007{7] after such an inactive month the tropics became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane{8] by that time however el nixc3xb1o conditions became established across the pacific{9] which is known to enhance pacific hurricane activity{3]three storms developed in october including hurricane paul {8] tropical activity within the basin in novemberxc2xa02006 was the most active on record based on the accumulated cyclone energy (ace) index three tropical cyclones formed of which two became tropical storms; only two other seasons on record 1961 and 2015 produced two tropical storms in the month of november{10] in addition mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006 none on the atlantic coast and all along the pacific coast{11] one hit baja california peninsula while the others made landfall on the mainland{12]an extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central pacific ocean in late october it drifted over unusually warm waters up to 36xc2xa0xc2xb0f (2xc2xa0xc2xb0c) above normal and gradually developed convection near the center by november 2 quikscat satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) about 900xc2xa0mi (1450xc2xa0km) west of oregon the system also developed an eye and an eyewall the cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened and dissipated on november 4 nasa considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm however as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization it was not named operationally the united states navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance numbered

a tropical storm with 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds{14] while named tropical cyclones in may are infrequent events aletta marked the seventh consecutive year to have a named cyclone form in may{15] the storm moved toward the guerrero coast in southwestern mexico prompting the mexican government to issue tropical storm watches between punta maldonado and zihuatanejo{16] aletta then became stationary over the guerrero and oaxaca coastlines but it later turned to the west and dissipated on mayxc2xa030{14]aletta produced moderate rainfall across mexico including a 24-hour rainfall

as it approached the coast of southwestern mexico; however shear persisted over the system and it weakened before dissipating on junexc2xa04{17]despite never becoming a named storm heavy rain occurred including a total of 1913xc2xa0inches (486xc2xa0mm) measured in a 48xe2x80x91hour period in acapulco{18] mudslides and flash flooding were reported{17] forcing 72xc2xa0people from their homes{19] no

depression it moved west-northwestward for its entire duration quickly intensifying into a tropical storm and hurricane a clear well-defined eye developed and bud became the first major hurricane of the season on julyxc2xa013 the hurricane attained peak winds of 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) although cooler waters and stable air caused a marked weakening trend by julyxc2xa015 bud weakened to tropical depression status and the next day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area{20] the remnants of bud produced light rainfall across hawaii{21]hurricane carlotta{edit]category

and moved across the atlantic ocean without development on julyxc2xa09 while crossing central america into the eastern north pacific ocean thunderstorm activity increased and the system organized into tropical depression four-e early on julyxc2xa012 about 290xc2xa0mi (465xc2xa0km) south of zihuatanejo guerrero{22] the large depression moved quickly to the west-northwest to the south of a ridge over northwestern mexico and its outer rainbands moved across the coast rainfall totals were less than 1xc2xa0inch (25xc2xa0mm){22] the depression intensified into tropical storm carlotta just six hours after forming{22] by late on julyxc2xa012 the storm developed banding features{23] and early on julyxc2xa013 carlotta attained hurricane status about 430xc2xa0mi (700xc2xa0km) south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula{22]as carlotta intensified the system became more compact and it reached peak winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) on julyxc2xa013{22] an eye formed in the center and the hurricane was briefly forecast to attain major hurricane status or a categoryxc2xa03 on the saffir-simpson scale{24] however carlotta weakened due to increased wind shear from hurricane bud to its west{22] and the eye and convection deteriorated{25] carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status late on julyxc2xa014 although a decrease in shear allowed it to reintensify into a hurricane this was short-lived as the center moved into the area of cooler waters and carlotta again weakened to tropical storm status{22] late on julyxc2xa015 the circulation became separated from the convection{26] and carlotta weakened to tropical depression status on julyxc2xa016 and the next day generated into a remnant low the circulation continued generally westward dissipating on julyxc2xa020 about 1500xc2xa0mi (2400xc2xa0km) east of the hawaiian islands{22]hurricane daniel{edit]category 4xc2xa0hurricanexc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationjuly 16xc2xa0xe2x80x93 july 26peak

peninsula and quickly increased in convective activity and organization becoming a tropical depression the system continued to organize and was designated as a tropical storm the next day on julyxc2xa018 daniel attained hurricane status and two days later underwent rapid intensification; it reached major hurricane status and was later upgraded further to categoryxc2xa04 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale its peak intensity was 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh){27] the hurricane underwent eyewall replacement cycles which are internal mechanisms that occur in most intense hurricanes daniel later became an annular hurricane which allowed it to maintain categoryxc2xa04 status for longer than it otherwise would have{28]it crossed over into the central pacific early on julyxc2xa024 and was predicted to affect hawaii as a tropical storm; however daniel encountered weak steering currents in the open ocean causing it to slow down considerably{27] it rapidly degenerated to a tropical depression on julyxc2xa025 and the cphc issued its last advisory on julyxc2xa026 while the storm was still well to the east of hawaii its remnants later moved across the hawaiian islands{27] dropping heavy rainfall and causing flooding{9] west wailuaiki on maui recorded 387xc2xa0inches (98xc2xa0mm) in one day which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane{21]tropical storm emilia{edit]tropical stormxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationjuly 21xc2xa0xe2x80x93 july 28peak intensity65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) (1-min)xc2xa0 990xc2xa0mbarxc2xa0(hpa)main article: tropical storm emilia (2006)the origins of emilia were from a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on julyxc2xa021 a short distance off the coast of acapulco it moved generally north-northwestward reaching tropical storm status on julyxc2xa022 and passing about 175xc2xa0mi (280xc2xa0km) southwest of manzanillo colima{29] an eyewall began to form that day{30] and emilia reached peak winds of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh){29] it briefly weakened due to wind shear although restrengthening occurred as the storm turned toward the baja california peninsula on julyxc2xa026 emilia again reached peak winds of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) and shortly thereafter it passed about 60xc2xa0mi (95xc2xa0km) southwest of the southern tip of baja california it weakened as it turned into cooler waters first to tropical depression status on julyxc2xa027 and then to a convective-less remnant low on julyxc2xa028 the remnants dissipated on julyxc2xa031 about 495xc2xa0mi (800xc2xa0km) west-southwest of san diego california{29]in southwestern mexico emilia produced tropical storm force winds along the coastline rainfall in the southern portion of the baja california peninsula caused minor flooding and gusty winds caused damage to buildings and power lines{29] moisture from emilia reached the southwestern united states thunderstorms and rainfall occurred across arizona causing flooding{31] in southern california the storm dropped light rainfall which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire{32]tropical storm fabio{edit]tropical

(1580xc2xa0km) southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula six hours later the depression was upgraded to tropical storm fabio it moved westward due to a ridge to its north and on augustxc2xa01 fabio reached peak winds of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) later the storm began weakening due to increased wind shear and dry air on augustxc2xa03 fabio deteriorated to tropical depression status and later that day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants continued westward moving across hawaii on augustxc2xa07{33]although fabio did not impact land its remnants produced heavy rainfall in hawaii in a 24-hour period 289xc2xa0inches (73xc2xa0mm) of rainfall was recorded at glenwood on the island of hawaii; this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island however the heaviest precipitation fell on mount waixcaxbbalexcaxbbale on kauai where 1508xc2xa0inches (383xc2xa0mm) fell in 24xc2xa0hours; this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state{34] the heavy rainfall flooded the hanalei river which forced the closure of the kuhio highway when a bridge was inundated{33] on oahu the rainfall caused ponding on roadways and flooding along streams one flooded stream stranded 24xc2xa0hikers along a trail all of whom required rescue by helicopter{35]tropical storm gilma{edit]tropical

the atlantic without developing on julyxc2xa025 it entered the eastern pacific gradually developing an area of organized convection despite marginally favorable upper-level winds the system organized enough to be declared a tropical depression on augustxc2xa01 several hundred miles southwest of acapulco mexico{36] initially the depression tracked west-northwestward{8] despite wind shear in the area{37] the depression was upgraded to tropical storm gilma later on augustxc2xa01 the wind shear prevented further strengthening or organization and gilma weakened to a tropical depression early on augustxc2xa02{36] the depression turned westward{8] and gilma degenerated into a remnant low by augustxc2xa04{36]hurricane hector{edit]category 2xc2xa0hurricanexc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationaugust

crossed central america into the northeastern pacific ocean on augustxc2xa010 convection gradually increased and a broad low pressure area developed about 375xc2xa0miles (605xc2xa0km) south of acapulco mexico on augustxc2xa013 the system continued to become organized and it developed into a tropical depression around 1800xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa015 about 650xc2xa0mi (1045xc2xa0km) south-southwest of the southern tip of baja california it moved west-northwestward located south of a ridge that extended westward from northern mexico westward into the pacific the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm hector early on augustxc2xa016{38] hector was able to steadily strengthen reaching hurricane status at 0600xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa017 it is estimated that hector reached its peak intensity of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) at 0600xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa018 while centered about 1035xc2xa0mi (1665xc2xa0km) southwest of the southern tip of baja california{8]hector remained a category 2 hurricane for about 24xc2xa0hours{8] shortly thereafter it encountered cooler waters and westerly shear{39] and hector steadily weakened until becoming a tropical storm by augustxc2xa020 shortly thereafter the storm reached a weakness in the subtropical ridge which caused it to move slowly to the northwest by augustxc2xa021 deep convection was confined to the northeast portion of the circulation{40] the shear was not strong enough to completely weaken the tropical cyclone and hector remained a tropical storm with 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) winds for about 24xc2xa0hours{38] after the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated on augustxc2xa022 the cyclone turned westward in response to the low-level easterly wind flow{41] hector weakened to a tropical depression at 0000xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa023 and to a remnant low sixxc2xa0hours later the remnant circulation of hector dissipated on augustxc2xa024 about 750xc2xa0mi (1210xc2xa0km) east of

crossing over johnston atoll two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening and ioke attained categoryxc2xa05 status on august 25xc2xa0before crossing the international date line at the time its barometric pressure was estimated at 915xc2xa0mbar thus becoming the strongest hurricane on record in the central pacific{9] as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on augustxc2xa031 it passed near wake island with winds of 155xc2xa0mph (249xc2xa0kmh) ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by septemberxc2xa06 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone{43] by then the cyclone had lasted 19xc2xa0days reaching the equivalent of category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale three times{9] the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into alaska{44]ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of 12xc2xa0people stayed in a hurricane-proof bunker on johnston atoll during the hurricane's passage; the crew estimated winds reached over 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island's bird population{9]{45] the hurricane left moderate damage on wake island totaling 88xc2xa0million (2006xc2xa0usd) which resulted from blown off roofs and damaged buildings although the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island the first full-scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in 1967{46]{47]{48] later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the alaskan coastline causing beach erosion{49]hurricane ileana{edit]category

major hurricane a day after that ileana reached its peak intensity of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) before beginning a slow weakening phase on augustxc2xa024 when it encountered cooler waters ileana weakened a tropical depression on the morning of augustxc2xa027 and quickly degenerated into a remnant low dissipating on augustxc2xa029{50] as ileana was heading north along the mexican coastline

categoryxc2xa04 on augustxc2xa030{53] hours later the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle{54] and subsequently weakened to categoryxc2xa03 status as it paralleled the mexican

but restrengthened to a major hurricane shortly after it made landfall near the southern tip of the baja california peninsula as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on septemberxc2xa01{57] john continued northwestward along the eastern baja california peninsula weakening to tropical depression status by septemberxc2xa03 and dissipating on septemberxc2xa04 in the gulf of california{53]along the southwestern coast of mexico hurricane john produced heavy surf strong winds and heavy rainfall which flooded roads caused mudslides and downed trees{53]{58] along the baja california peninsula the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall with a 24-hour peak of 108xc2xa0inches (276xc2xa0mm) in los planes{59] the heavy rainfall caused flooding closed roads{60] and caused a dam to overflow{61] the winds

status for long partly due to its proximity to hurricane john{67] there was a possibility of a fujiwhara interaction between both systems causing kristy to weaken or perhaps be absorbed into the circulation of john{68] this did not occur however kristy weakened steadily after its peak intensity and looked to be close to dissipating but on septemberxc2xa03 and again on septemberxc2xa05

remnants of hurricane kristy although subsequent analysis confirmed they were two separate systems initially the depression was in an area of favorable conditions with little wind shear and warm waters{9] as a result the cphc predicted significant strengthening to at least hurricane status{74] instead a high pressure system to its north increased wind shear over the depression causing the convection to become removed from the center the depression weakened into a remnant low on septemberxc2xa020 never reaching tropical storm status{9]tropical depression three-c{edit]tropical

intertropical convergence zone extended across the central pacific ocean resembling an extension of the monsoon trough an area of disturbed weather formed well to the southwest of hawaii organizing slowly for several days late on octoberxc2xa013 after the development of a low-level circulation and persistent convection the cphc classified the system as tropical depression four-c about 750xc2xa0mi (1200xc2xa0km) southwest of honolulu hawaii upon being classified the depression was located in an unusual steering flow that caused it to track eastward due to the approach of an upper-level trough it was expected to dissipate quickly from wind shear although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an outflow channel which might allow strengthening{83] on octoberxc2xa014 strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center and the system degenerated into a remnant low{9]the remnant circulation continued slowly eastward dissipating on octoberxc2xa016 concurrently the convection tracked northeastward ahead of the upper-level trough which contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding on the island of hawaii on octoberxc2xa017{9] the

of tropical depression eighteen-e were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of africa on octoberxc2xa07 it briefly spawned a low-pressure area as the wave continued westward without development on octoberxc2xa020 the wave entered the pacific ocean developing an area of thunderstorms about four days later by 1200xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa026 a tropical depression formed about 155xc2xa0mi (260xc2xa0km) south of manzanillo{90] initially tropical depression eighteen-e was located in an area of light wind shear and the nhc anticipated further organization and strengthening to near hurricane status{91] the tropical depression initially maintained a steady westward motion away from the mexican coastline due to a ridge north of the cyclone{91] by octoberxc2xa017 convection had decreased and the depression was not forecast to intensify as much{92] possibly due to intrusion of dry air the circulation became exposed from the thunderstorms and having weakened it turned to a southward drift{93] by 0000xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa028 the system had weakened to a non-convective remnant low which dissipated the following day{90]tropical storm rosa{edit]tropical

environmental conditions appeared favorable{95] although wind shear removed the convection from the circulation{96] throughout its duration the storm maintained a northwest track through a weakness in a subtropical ridge{97] by novemberxc2xa09 a new area of convection persisted near the center{98] and a banding feature formed{97] despite the shear the depression was upgraded to tropical storm rosa although the shear prevented intensification beyond its peak of 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh){94] rosa remained a tropical storm for only 18xc2xa0hours becoming a tropical depression early on novemberxc2xa010 and dissipating later that day{94] rosa was the first tropical storm in the basin to develop during november since 2000 and was also the first tropical depression to form in the month since 2002's tropical depression sixteen-e no impact was reported from the storm{94]tropical depression twenty-e{edit]tropical depressionxc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationnovember 11xc2xa0xe2x80x93 november

its duration the depression never completely separated from the intertropical convergence zone{99] when the nhc issued its first advisory on the depression the agency predicted slight intensification to tropical storm status and for the depression to last at least two days this was due to a forecast of gradually increasing wind shear after the first 24xc2xa0hours{100] instead the circulation became very elongated; it is estimated the cyclone degenerated into a trough by late on novemberxc2xa011{99]hurricane sergio{edit]category 2xc2xa0hurricanexc2xa0(sshws)xc2xa0durationnovember

intensified as it tracked southeastward reaching peak winds of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) on novemberxc2xa015 subsequently it began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north

produced light rainfall along the coast of mexico though its effects were minimal{102] the formation of sergio marked the 2006 season as the most active in 12xc2xa0years and the second season in which more than one tropical storm formed in november after 1961 sergio set records for the month of november in the basin at the time it was considered the strongest hurricane to form in the month; although it has since dropped to third after sandra from 2015 and kenneth from 2011 it is however still considered the longest-lived november pacific tropical cyclone with a duration of seven

over the northeast pacific ocean and began to strengthen by october 31 the storm had acquired tropical characteristics including an eye convection and a warmer-than-average core the system reached peak intensity on november 1 before slowly weakening and looping towards the pacific northwest the system made landfall in washington state on november 3 before rapidly weakening and dissipating on the next day during the duration of the storm the system was known as storm 91c (or invest 91c) the storm's true nature still remains controversial among meteorologists today due to disputes over the storm's exact structure and whether or not it had obtained tropical or subtropical characteristics because the storm was not within the area of responsibility of the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center the storm was never assigned a namestorm names{edit]the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast pacific in 2006{103] this is the same
