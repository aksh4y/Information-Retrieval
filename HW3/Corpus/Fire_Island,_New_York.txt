(249xc2xa0km2){2]historical modifications{edit]the physical attributes of the island have changed over time and they continue to change at one point it stretched more than 60 miles (97xc2xa0km) from jones beach island to southamptonaround 1683 fire island inlet broke through separating it from jones beach island{4]the fire island inlet grew to 9 miles (14xc2xa0km) in width before receding the fire island lighthouse was built in 1858 right on the inlet but fire island's western terminus at democrat point has steadily moved west so that the lighthouse today is 6 miles (10xc2xa0km) from the inletfire island separated from southampton in a 1931 nor'easter when moriches inlet broke through however this was expected the inlet widened on september 21 1938 moriches inlet and efforts by local communities east of fire island to protect their beach front with jetties have led to an interruption in the longshore drift of sand going from east to west and is blamed for erosion of the fire island beachfront{5] between these major breaks there have been reports over the years of at least six inlets that broke through the island but have since disappearedetymology{edit]entrance to board the ferry to cherry grove fire islandthe origin of fire island's name is not certain it is believed its native american name was sictem hackey which translated to "land of the secatogues" the secatogues were a tribe in the area of the current town of islip it was part of what was also called the "seal islands"{6]the name of fire island first appeared on a deed in 1789{7]historian richard bayles suggested that the name derives from a misinterpretation or corruption of the dutch word vijf ("five") or in another version vier ("four") referring to the number of islands near the fire island inlet{8] at times histories have referred to it in the plural as "fire islands" because of the inlet breaksother versions say the island derived its name from fires built on the sea's edge by native americans or by pirates to lure unsuspecting ships into the sandbars some say it is how portions of the island look to be on fire from sea in autumn yet another version says it comes from the rash caused by poison ivy on the island{4]while the western portion of the island was referred to as fire island for many years the eastern portion was referred to as great south beach until 1920 when widespread development caused the whole land mass to be called fire island{7]history{edit]fire island lighthouse east of robert moses field 5settlement{edit]william "tangier" smith held title to the entire island in the 17th century under a royal patent from thomas dongan the remnants of smith's manor of st george are open to the public in shirley new yorkthe first large house was built in 1795 in cherry grove by jeremiah smith smith was said to have lured ships to their doom and killed the crews{9]{10]in the early 19th century when slavery was still legal in new york slave runners built stockades on the island by the fire island inletthe first fire island lighthouse was built in 1825 and was replaced by the current lighthouse in 1858in 1855 david ss sammis bought 120 acres (049xc2xa0km2) near the fire island lighthouse and built the surf hotel at what today is kismet sammis operated the hotel until 1892 when the state took it over in 1908 it became the first state park on long islandin 1868 archer and elizabeth perkinson bought the land around cherry grove and fire island pines they built a hotel in 1880in 1887 the coast guard established 11 manned lifesaving stations on the islandin 1892 troops were called out to suppress a potential riot at democrat point over a cholera panic{11]in 1908 ocean beach was established followed by saltaire in 1910in 1921 the perkinsons sold the land around cherry grove in small lots bungalows from the newly closed camp upton in yaphank were ferried over the great south bay to build the new community duffy's hotel was built in 1930the great hurricane of 1938 devastated much of the island and made it appear undesirable to many however duffy's hotel remained relatively undamaged according to legend the gay population began to concentrate in cherry grove at duffy's hotel with christopher isherwood and w h auden dressed as dionysus and ganymede and carried aloft on a gilded litter by a group of singing followers{12] the gay influence was continued in the 1960s when male model john b whyte developed fire island pines the pines currently has some of the most expensive property on the island and accounts for two-thirds of the island's swimming pools{13]in 1964 robert moses built the captree causeway to the western end of the island{14] opponents fearing that this was the beginning of plans for the continuation of ocean parkway which would have run down the middle of the island organized and eventually stopped the parkwayin september 1964 lyndon johnson signed a bill creating fire island national seashore2009: beach renourishment{edit]a 2009 beach renourishment program was credited with saving the island from the full effects of hurricane sandy in 2012in the winter and spring of 2009 a beach renourishment project was undertaken on fire island with the cooperation of the national park service the us army corps of engineers the towns of brookhaven and islip and fire island residents the renourishment program involved dredging sand from an offshore borrow area pumping it onto the beach and shaping the sand into an approved beach face and dune template in front of the communities of corneille estates davis park dunewood fair harbor fire island pines fire island summer club lonelyville ocean bay park ocean beach saltaire and seaview fire islanders agreed to a significant property tax increase to help pay for the project which was estimated to cost between 23 and 25 million (6020 per housing unit) including the cost of environmental monitoring and was expected to add 1400000 cubic meters (1800000 cubic yards) of sand in front of the participating communities the towns of brookhaven and islip in which the communities are located issued bonds to pay for the project backed by the new taxes levied by community erosion control taxing districts2012: hurricane sandy{edit]the island was heavily damaged in the high tides associated with hurricane sandy in 2012 including three breaches around smith point county park on the sparsely populated east end of the island the biggest breach (and politically most difficult one to deal with because it is in a wilderness area) is at old inlet in the otis pike wilderness area just west of smith point county park old inlet is at the site of previous breaches (which have come and gone on their own) was 108 feet wide after the storm on the south end and 1171 feet on february 28 2013{15] officials have been debating whether to close the breach and let nature take its course as it has been flushing out the great south bay and improving water quality however residents of the bay front communities noted increased flooding after the storm this flooding was later found to be the result of several nor'easters and unrelated to the breaches{16] as of 2015{update] the breach remained open officials have moved to close the other two breaches which are on either side of moriches inletxe2x80x94one in cupsogue county park and the other one being in smith point county park{17]{18]{19]reports indicated that 80 percent of the homes particularly those on the east end were flooded and 90 homes were completely destroyed{20] the storm also tore away about 75 feet of the dune coastline but fire island was not hit as hard as other areas and most of the 4500 homes on the island survived even if damaged officials credited the dune replenishment program with helping to spare the island{21]landmarks and preserves{edit]panorama of fire island from the top of the fire island lighthouse (distorted
