young a writer for the late show with david letterman was brought in as a freelance writer to write the episode{4] the writers wanted to explore what made flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does{4] the original idea came from george meyer who had also wanted an episode about flanders' faith being tested{5] one of the key story points came from his friend jack handey a writer for saturday night live who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him but make very bad shoes likewise it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild flanders' house but do a bad job and provoke an outburst{5]writer john swartzwelder's animated likeness can be seen in a padded cell in reference to his reclusivenessa caricature of john swartzwelder can be seen shutting the door of a room in calmwood mental hospital{4] later in the episode during the scene where the townsfolk are welcoming ned back someone can be seen holding a sign that says "free john swartzwelder"{5] during the sequence where flanders yells at the town a man with a ponytail and wearing a white shirt who is a caricature of bob anderson can be seen{6]cultural references{edit]the scene at the beginning of the episode in which the people of springfield mob the kwik-e-mart is based on the events of the 1992 los angeles riots{4] todd is wearing a butthole surfers shirt; however the censors only allowed "buttho surfers"{4] jay sherman from the critic who had previously appeared in "a star is burns" can also be seen in the mental hospital repeatedly saying his catchphrase "it stinks"{4] the small door at the end of the hallway in flanders' rebuilt house echoes the improbably small hallway in the film willy wonka  the chocolate factory{4]reception{edit]in its original broadcast "hurricane neddy" finished 18th in ratings for the week of december 23xe2x80x9329 1996 with a nielsen rating of 87 equivalent to approximately 84 million viewing households it was the second-highest-rated show on the fox network that week following the x-files{7]marge's line "dear god this is marge simpson if you stop this hurricane and save our family we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends" was cited by journalist mark pinsky as an example of how "simpson family members are both defined and circumscribed by religion"{8] journalist ben rayner speculated that some fans whom he called "nerds" would want an explanation of "how barney fit through that tiny door to the 'master bedroom' in the rebuilt flanders family home"{9]references{edit]^ a b hurricane neddy bbccouk retrieved on march 27 2007^ a b "hurricane neddy" the simpsonscom retrieved on march 27 2007^ groening matt (1997) richmond ray; coffman
