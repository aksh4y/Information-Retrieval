peninsula mexico belizepart of the 2000 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane keith was an atlantic hurricane in october 2000 that caused extensive damage in central america especially in mexico and belize it was the fifteenth tropical cyclone eleventh named storm and seventh hurricane of the that year's atlantic hurricane season keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western caribbean sea on septemberxc2xa028 the depression gradually strengthened and became tropical storm keith on the following day as the storm tracked westward it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on septemberxc2xa030 shortly thereafter keith began to rapidly deepen and peaked as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane less than 24xc2xa0hours later keith then began to meander erratically offshore of belize which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction by late on octoberxc2xa02 keith made landfall in ambergris caye belize as a minimal hurricane it quickly weakened to a tropical storm before another landfall occurred near belize city early on the following day while moving inland over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula keith weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the gulf of mexico on octoberxc2xa04 once in the gulf of mexico keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and a hurricane on the following day by late on octoberxc2xa05 keith made its third and final landfall near tampico tamaulipas mexico as a moderately strong category 1 hurricane the storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24xc2xa0hours after landfallkeith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in central america which resulted in extensive flooding especially in belize and mexico in guatemala the storm flooded 10 towns and caused one fatality similarly one fatality also occurred in el salvador and at least 300xc2xa0people were affected by flooding in that country thirteen communities in nicaragua were completely isolated after keith made roads impassable twelve deaths were reported in nicaragua all of which were flood-related five people were presumed dead in honduras after an aircraft disappeared near roatxc3xa1n; one other fatality occurred due to flooding the storm brought torrential rainfall to belize with many areas reporting at least 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) of rain while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than 30 inches (760xc2xa0mm) in belize a village reported that only 12xc2xa0houses remained while elsewhere in the country at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged; several houses in belize city suffered minor roof damage at least 19xc2xa0people were killed in belize and damages totaled to 280xc2xa0million (2000xc2xa0usd) heavy rainfall also occurred in mexico especially in the states of nuevo lexc3xb3n and tamaulipas flooding from keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels throughout mexico at least 460xc2xa0houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred in addition one person drowned due to heavy rainfall damages incurred in associated with keith in mexico totaled to approximately 3659xc2xa0million (2000xc2xa0mxn 387xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd) overall keith was responsible for 68 deaths and 319 million (2000 usd) in damage{1]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 belize32 mexico33 elsewhere4 aftermath5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon septemberxc2xa016 2000 a tropical wave xe2x80x93 an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west xe2x80x93 exited the west coast of africa it moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear after moving across the caribbean sea a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on septemberxc2xa027{2] the next day a hurricane hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of 37xc2xa0mph (60xc2xa0kmh); upon receiving the data the national hurricane center (nhc) initiated advisories on tropical depression fifteen at 2100xc2xa0utc{3] the nhc later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier about 70xc2xa0mi (110xc2xa0km) north-northeast of cabo gracias a dios{2] upon forming the depression had good outflow although the convection was not as organized{3] with an anticyclone over the system the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest a motion caused by weak steering winds{4] late on septemberxc2xa028 the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it keith{2] after another hurricane hunters mission reported flight-level winds of 61xc2xa0mph (98xc2xa0kmh){5]hurricane keith near landfall in belize on october 1by the time keith became a tropical storm it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening{2] fueled by warm waters low wind shear and an organizing cloud pattern{5] there initially was uncertainty in the storm's future movement due to a ridge in the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments; three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward florida due to a trough while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west-northwest eventually reaching the bay of campeche{6] after continued strengthening keith became a hurricane on septemberxc2xa030 just 18xc2xa0hours after becoming a tropical storm{2] and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season{7] that day an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized{8] in a 13xe2x80x91hour period beginning at 1808xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa030 keith underwent explosive deepening as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly 3xc2xa0mbar (0089xc2xa0inhg) per hour{2] the nhc noted that keith experienced conditions "ideal for strengthening" with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{9] the hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern belize caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to tropical storm leslie forming over cuba{2] by early on octoberxc2xa01 keith had developed a well-defined eye about 20xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) in diameter with what the nhc described as a "spectacular appearance"{10] later that day hurricane hunters estimated a minimum pressure of 939xc2xa0mbar (277xc2xa0inhg) and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of 176xc2xa0mph (283xc2xa0kmh) based on the data the nhc estimated that keith attained peak winds of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) at 0700xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa01 while just offshore eastern belize this made it a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{2]shortly after keith reached peak intensity the eye had moved over portions of belize causing it to lose definition outflow became restricted and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear as a result keith began to weaken steadily on octoberxc2xa01{11] while remaining nearly stationary keith made a landfall on ambergris cay late on octoberxc2xa02 as a minimal hurricane shortly thereafter keith weakened into a tropical storm{2] and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant{12] at 0300xc2xa0utc the storm made its second landfall about 29xc2xa0mi (47xc2xa0km) north of belize city and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression{2] the building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west-northwest across the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{13] early on octoberxc2xa04 keith emerged into the bay of campeche{2] where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop{14] later that day it re-intensified into a tropical storm{2] with improved outflow and convective organization{15] on octoberxc2xa05 the hurricane hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status{16] keith intensified further that day until it made its final landfall 23xc2xa0mi (37xc2xa0km) north of tampico with winds of 90xc2xa0mph (150xc2xa0kmh){2] it rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern mexico{17] dissipating late on octoberxc2xa06{2]preparations{edit]on septemberxc2xa029 shortly after keith formed a hurricane watch was issued for the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula from chetumal to cabo catoche in quintana roo the next day as keith was nearing hurricane intensity the watch was upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the belize coastline from belize city to the mexican border at that time the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift hurricane warnings were issued for the belize coast with only about 24xc2xa0hours of lead time for the offshore islands the warnings for the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula were dropped as keith weakened{2]on octoberxc2xa02 the government of belize declared a state of emergency and activated the entire belize defence force due to the storm's threat{18] the airport in belize city was closed during keith's passage limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands{19] in corozal belize authorities evacuated the entire city of 10000xc2xa0people to numerous shelters in orange walk{20] officials were also ordered evacuations for belize city setting up shelters in belmopan{21] overall about 25000xc2xa0people evacuate or about 10 of belize's population{22] three hospitals were evacuated in the country{23] in a post-storm assessment residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity{24]in quintana roo 5000xc2xa0people from chetumal and surrounding low-lying areas were forced to evacuate to 30xc2xa0shelters{25]{26] offshore along a coral reef about 50xc2xa0fishermen stayed on a coral reef during the storm{25] in the bay of campeche pemex evacuated about 6300xc2xa0workers from its offshore oil platforms{27] officials in yucatxc3xa1n and veracruz declared states of emergency{18] when keith reached the gulf of mexico and began re-intensifying a hurricane warning was issued from tuxpan to matamoros in northeastern mexico with a tropical storm watch issued northward to port mansfield texas{2] about 3000xc2xa0residents in tamaulipas evacuated to 250xc2xa0shelters and in neighboring veracruz about 175xc2xa0people left their houses before the storm struck the threat of hurricane keith caused mexican authorities to close most ports along the gulf coast{28] and many schools in the area were closed{29]impact{edit]deaths by regionregiontotaldeathssourcebelize19{30]el

produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in central america belize bore the brunt of the storm with about 280xc2xa0million in damage and 19xc2xa0confirmed fatalities primarily related to flooding several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding including el salvador guatemala honduras mexico and nicaragua overall keith was responsible for 40xc2xa0deaths{2]{30] as well as approximately 319xc2xa0million in damage{1]{32]belize{edit]destruction to an airplane hangar in belizewhile keith was offshore from belize northerly winds blew water out of the bay of chetumal there were reports of people walking onto the temporarily dry bay floor despite the potential for the waters to return in the event of shifting winds at caye caulker the hurricane produced a 4xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) storm surge from the west winds were unofficially estimated to have reached 125xc2xa0mph (201xc2xa0kmh) in the offshore islands of belize wind gusts on the mainland reached 61xc2xa0mph (98xc2xa0kmh) at philip s w goldson international airport due to its slow motion keith dropped heavy rainfall amounting to over 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) in many parts of the country the highest recorded precipitation total was 3267 inches (830xc2xa0mm) at the international airport in belize city{2]the strong winds destroyed 130xc2xa0houses in belize{22] two hotel roofs were wrecked and the winds knocked down trees and power lines widespread areas of belize lost power and telephone service including belize city there the heavy rainfall flooded streets{26] reaching 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) deep{33] twenty homes were damaged to some degree in the capital while many more suffered minor roof damage{20] the rains flooded the first floor of the primary hospital in the city{34] causing severe damage{35] nationwide 11xc2xa0health facilities were damaged{36] elsewhere in the country the rains increased levels along rivers{18] including the belize river rio hondo and new river{37] the belize river rose for several days after the storm{38] reaching record levels of 21xc2xa0ft (66xc2xa0m) in width{37] which isolated 15xc2xa0villages{39] flooding covered northern highway and western highway as well as the primary bridge from belmopan to the rest of cayo district{40] residual floodwaters persisted due to the low-lying land of the country and poor drainage{41] floods contaminated water supply in the northern four districts{42] causing an e coli outbreak and food poisoning{43] in belize corozal and orange walk districts about 30 of the houses were severely damaged by flooding{42]damage was heaviest in the northern offshore islands and in the northern portion of the mainland{44] on the offshore islands downed trees and power lines blocked most roads{42] in caye caulker and san pedro keith damaged the roofs of about 90 of houses and damaged or destroyed 676xc2xa0houses{28] leaving 3279xc2xa0people homeless{42] about 50 of the houses in caye caulker were destroyed{35] with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm{45] in san pedro about 30 of houses{35] or at least 50 were wrecked{45] on ambergris caye four airplanes were destroyed{42] at turneffe atoll about 35 of the landmass was affected with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous tree branches snapped{46]five individuals died in maritime accidents involving at least one catamaran{2] there was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees killing four people on board{35] three people died on the offshore ambergris caye{47] overall 19xc2xa0people perished in the country{30] several injuries mainly from flying debris were reported in san pedro{1] and there were 142xc2xa0people who were injured in the storm{42] throughout the country approximately 3279xc2xa0homes were either damaged or destroyed{47] the damage total from keith was initially estimated at 200xc2xa0million about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage{48] about 75 of the crops in the country were damaged including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in october{47] the damage total was later estimated at 280xc2xa0million{1] most of it on the offshore ambergris cay and caye caulker{2]mexico{edit]damage totals in mexicoin thousands of mexican pesos year 2000 unadjusted for

additional 397xc2xa0million (2000xc2xa0mxn 42xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd) in indirect costs{32] while crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula keith dropped heavy rainfall including over 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) in campeche state{49] chetumal quintana roo reported 965xc2xa0in (245xc2xa0mm) of precipitation{2]when keith made its final landfall tampico reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 63xc2xa0mph (101xc2xa0kmh){2] the winds damaged billboards and some trees in the city and elsewhere along the coast keith knocked down trees and power lines{28] about 200000xc2xa0people in northeastern mexico lost power and 100000xc2xa0people were left without water{50] about 400xc2xa0houses were damaged in veracruz and many roads and bridges were destroyed{51] heavy rainfall occurred in the interior of northeastern mexico peaking at 2455xc2xa0in (624xc2xa0mm) in gonzxc3xa1lez tamaulipas{2] in a reporting station in the municipality of gxc3xb3mez farxc3xadas the pluviometer reported a 24-hour rain total of 1324 inches (336xc2xa0mm) and a storm total of 1844 inches (468xc2xa0mm) which broke the precipitation record for that location which counted with 35xc2xa0years of data{32] this rain also caused rivers to reach record levels as the sabinas river rose 1095xc2xa0m (359xc2xa0ft) on october 6 to a new historical peak and the guayalejo river rose 7746xc2xa0ft (2361xc2xa0m) slightly under the 1976 record this rainfall caused the las xc3x81nimas dam to catch 525000 acre feet (648000000xc2xa0m3) of water between october 5 and october 17; however some of this water had to be released as the upstream face of the dam was damaged by debris and had to be repaired overall the storm produced 1178xc2xa0million in damage (2000 mxn 124xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd) in the state{32]in nuevo lexc3xb3n the remnants of keith interacted with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall{49] reaching 1443xc2xa0in (367xc2xa0mm) in sabinas{2] the average precipitation in the state was 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm) and the deluge caused causing mudslides in several cities including san pedro guadalupe and escobedo high rainfall also caused flash flood in mountainous areas near monterrey forming swift river currents that rose up to 9000xc2xa0ftxc2xb3s (250xc2xa0mxc2xb3s) and dragged 130xc2xa0people into local rivers; however all were rescued the rivers also dragged 30 vehicles all of which were moderate to total losses the storm runoff caused the el cuchillo dam to receive 105000 acre feet (130000000xc2xa0m3) of water daily and the la boca dam to receive 810 acre feet (1000000xc2xa0m3) per hour about 13000xc2xa0residents lost power about 5000xc2xa0people were forced evacuated from several municipalities in the state including 2465 from monterrey and 1900 from rural areas at a cost of 400000 (2000 mxn){32]{32] the total damages in the state rose to 1156xc2xa0million (2000 mxn us122xc2xa0million in year 2000) with the damage to urban infrastructure being the most expensive portion of the damage with 442xc2xa0million (2000 mxn us46xc2xa0million in 2000) used to repair damage in eight municipalities; in particular san pedro garza garcxc3xada received approximately three quarters of the infrastructure damage with 308xc2xa0million (2000 mxn 33xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd) additionally about 460xc2xa0homes were damaged or destroyed and 300xc2xa0families had to be relocated to safer areas{32]hurricane keith making its final landfall in mexico with tropical storm olivia in the pacific on october 5in other states damage was lighter but still significant in sonora total damages rose to 644xc2xa0million (2000 mxn 68xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd); in chiapas 256xc2xa0million (2000 mxn 27xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd) of property damage were caused by the storm this brings up the total damage in mexico to 3659xc2xa0million (2000 mxn 387xc2xa0million 2000xc2xa0usd){32] in tabasco flooding damaged 7896xc2xa0houses{51] approximately 24000xc2xa0residents in the state were impacted by flooding at the capital city of villahermosa large rivers in the area overflowed flooding some streets however dikes and sandbags along the banks of the rivers prevented further flooding{52] overall about 46000xc2xa0people had to evacuate mexico due to the storm and its flooding{29] there was one fatality when a man in tampico was electrocuted by a downed power line{28] in xicotxc3xa9ncatl tamaulipas a swollen river killed a family of six when their house was flooded{53] overall keith killed 23xc2xa0people in mexico xe2x80x93 13 in veracruz 4 in puebla and 6 in tamaulipas there were six indirect deaths when a plane crashed while attempting to land in reynosa tamaulipas{31]elsewhere{edit]the outerbands of keith brought intermittent rainfall to several areas of cuba though the amounts were very light{54] while keith was organizing the storm drew moisture from the eastern pacific ocean across central america producing heavy rainfall{55] in guatemala the rains caused flooding in ten towns and inundated approximately 500xc2xa0farms in the melchor de mencos municipality with about 4 inches (100xc2xa0mm) of water{2] additionally one fatality was reported{56] governor of petxc3xa9n department adxc3xa1n regalado remarked that "many communities are cut off by flooded rivers"{52] in el salvador a 20-year-old man drowned in a river{57] and 200xc2xa0families had to evacuate after several houses were damaged or destroyed{58] rainfall in honduras forced over 200xc2xa0families to evacuate their houses one person died when a wall collapsed{59] and there were five other fatalities an aircraft disappeared near roatan island{2] a bridge along the pan-american highway between honduras and nicaragua was destroyed which had been rebuilt following hurricane mitch{58] additionally a government agency reported that as many as 80000xc2xa0people in southern honduras were left isolated{52]in nicaragua floods from the storm forced 3962xc2xa0people to evacuate their houses to 57xc2xa0shelters{60] many of which were schools{61] floods affected 11 of the 17xc2xa0departments of nicaragua which began receding on octoberxc2xa05 as keith exited the region the floods caused several landslides and covered roads which isolated communities{62] keith damaged 436xc2xa0houses in the country and destroyed another 160{38] there were 12xc2xa0fatalities due to the storm in nicaragua{2] one of whom a boy who was swept away by a fast moving flooded river northeast of managua{57] while another death occurred after a man drowned in lake managua a man in the western portions of the country died after stepping on a power lines which had fallen due to strong winds fifty communities were isolated with at least thirteen of them due to impassable roads{36] several neighborhoods in corinto flooded forcing the civil defense to evacuate 9xc2xa0families one house collapsed in los xc3x81ngeles though its ten occupant escape without injury after rainfall lashed in villanueva chinandega for six days the resultant flooding forced 300xc2xa0families evacuated while there was significant losses the corn beans and plantains crops an additional 20xc2xa0families left their homes due to flooding in poneloya about 15xc2xa0families in the port city of puerto sandino were evacuated after the el contrabando river overflowed another 18xc2xa0homes were flooded in the region of salinas grandes about 52xc2xa0fled troilo after at least 11xc2xa0homes flooded{63]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane nameson octoberxc2xa03 a belize ambassador issued an appeal to the international community for food and money due to the damage from keith{22] united nations development programme received 30000 from the government of norway to give immediate relief to the country of belize united nations children's fund also gave out 150000 for relief in areas not focused on by other relief groups{64] the peace corps the red cross and the united states navy black hawk helicopters worked together to deliver rice corn sugar salt cooking oil toilet paper and medications to about 700xc2xa0families in bermuda landings and adjacent isolated villages the american red cross donated about 28500 and 4080xc2xa0family hygiene kits{47] between october and november 2000 the national society distributed 5289xc2xa0food and hygiene parcels to 26293xc2xa0people in belize city orange walk and belmopan around that time the belize red cross society (brcs) distributed relief items to 4622xc2xa0victims in belize city the brcs also shipped two containers with kitchen sets and water buckets for 1600xc2xa0families donated by the german red cross{65] a donation account to help the relief effort titled hurricane keith relief fund was set up by the town of placencia in the local atlantic bank the belize consulate in california also set up a donation fundraiser placencia also delivered a boat full of donated food clothing and building supplies to the san pedro and caye caulker area{66]in the immediate aftermath officials enacted a curfew for belize city caye caulker and san pedro to curtail looting and the latter two areas were declared disaster areas the entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas{40] there were initial difficulties in determining the needs in the affected residents due to cut communications{45] the government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands{67] several emergency teams were sent to caye caulker and san pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after keith's occurrence the belize international airport was back online by the morning of october 4 only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area{66] by that time boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists{67] workers quickly restored power and water in belize city{43] in the days after the storm struck residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease{35] in orange walk and cayo district residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes{45]in nicaragua the united states ambassador declared a disaster which prompted various united nations departments to provide 25000 to the country{61]the name keith was retired in the spring of 2001 and will never again be used for a north atlantic hurricane{68] the name was replaced with kirk for the 2006 atlantic hurricane season{69] however since the name kirk was not used during the course of 2006 it was then first used during the 2012 atlantic hurricane seasonsee also{edit]tropical cyclones
