the appalachian mountains virginia is nicknamed the "old dominion" due to its status as the first english colonial possession established in mainland north america{8] and "mother of presidents" because eight us presidents were born there more than any other state the geography and climate of the commonwealth are shaped by the blue ridge mountains and the chesapeake bay which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna the capital of the commonwealth is richmond; virginia beach is the most populous city and fairfax county is the most populous political subdivision the commonwealth's estimated population as of 2017{update] is over 84 million{2]the area's history begins with several indigenous groups including the powhatan in 1607 the london company established the colony of virginia as the first permanent new world english colony slave labor and the land acquired from displaced native american tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy virginia was one of the 13 colonies in the american revolution and joined the confederacy in the american civil war during which richmond was made the confederate capital and virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of west virginia although the commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following reconstruction both major national parties are competitive in modern virginia{9]the virginia general assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the new world{10] the state government was ranked most effective by the pew center on the states in both 2005 and 2008{11] it is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally manages local roads and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the shenandoah valley; federal agencies in northern virginia including the headquarters of the us department of defense and central intelligence agency (cia); and military

virginiageographically and geologically virginia is divided into five regions from east to west: tidewater piedmont blue ridge mountains ridge and valley and cumberland plateau{12]virginia has a total area of 427742 square miles (1107847xc2xa0km2) including 318013 square miles (82365xc2xa0km2) of water making it the 35th-largest state by area{13] virginia is bordered by maryland and washington dc to the north and east; by the atlantic ocean to the east; by north carolina to the south; by tennessee to the southwest; by kentucky to the west; and by west virginia to the north and west virginia's boundary with maryland and washington dc extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the potomac river{14] the southern border is defined as the 36xc2xb0xc2xa030xe2x80xb2 parallel north though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes{15] the border with tennessee was not settled until 1893 when their dispute was brought to the us supreme court{16]geology and terrainthe chesapeake bay separates the contiguous portion of the commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of virginia's eastern shore the bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the susquehanna river and the james river{17] many of virginia's rivers flow into the chesapeake bay including the potomac rappahannock york and james which create three peninsulas in the bay{18]{19]deciduous and evergreen trees give the blue ridge mountains their distinct color{20]the tidewater is a coastal plain between the atlantic coast and the fall line it includes the eastern shore and major estuaries of chesapeake bay the piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the mesozoic era{21] the region known for its heavy clay soil includes the southwest mountains around charlottesville{22] the blue ridge mountains are a physiographic province of the appalachian mountains with the highest points in the state the tallest being mount rogers at 5729 feet (1746xc2xa0m){23] the ridge and valley region is west of the mountains and includes the great appalachian valley the region is carbonate rock based and includes massanutten mountain{24] the cumberland plateau and the cumberland mountains are in the southwest corner of virginia south of the allegheny plateau in this region rivers flow northwest with a dendritic drainage system into the ohio river basin{25]the virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity earthquakes are rarely above 45xc2xa0in magnitude because virginia is located away from the edges of the north american plate the largest earthquake at an estimated 59xc2xa0magnitude was in 1897 near blacksburg{26] a 58 magnitude earthquake struck central virginia on august 23 2011 near mineral the earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as toronto atlanta and florida{27]coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near mesozoic basins{28] over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources such as slate kyanite sand or gravel were also mined in virginia in 2012{29] the state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4000 caves ten of which are open for tourism{30] 35 million years ago a bolide impacted what is now eastern virginia the resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region{31]climatemain article: climate of virginiavirginia state-wide averagesclimate chart

vary from average lows of 26xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x923xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in january to average highs of 86xc2xa0xc2xb0f (30xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in july the atlantic ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the state influenced by the gulf stream coastal weather is subject to hurricanes most pronouncedly near the mouth of chesapeake bay{33] in spite of its position adjacent to the atlantic ocean even the coastal areas have a significant continental influence with quite large temperature differences between summer and winter particularly given the state climate's subtropical classification which is typical of states in the upper southvirginia has an annual average of 35xe2x80x9345 days of thunderstorm activity particularly in the western part of the state{34] and an average annual precipitation of 427 inches (108xc2xa0cm){33] cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls such as the blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of 2009xe2x80x932010 the interaction of these elements with the state's topography creates distinct microclimates in the shenandoah valley the mountainous southwest and the coastal plains{35] virginia averages seven tornadoes annually most f2 or lower on the fujita scale{36]in recent years the expansion of the southern suburbs of washington dc into northern virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas{37] in the american lung association's 2011 report 11 counties received failing grades for air quality with fairfax county having the worst in the state due to automobile pollution{38]{39] haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants{40]ecosystemsee also: list of endangered species in virginiaforests cover 65 of the state primarily with deciduous broad leaf trees in the western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of virginia{41] lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance with hickory and oak in the blue ridge{32] however since the early 1990s gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests{42] in the lowland tidewater and piedmont yellow pines tend to dominate with bald cypress wetland forests in the great dismal and nottoway swamps other common trees and plants include red bay wax myrtle dwarf palmetto tulip poplar mountain laurel milkweed daisies and many species of ferns the largest areas of wilderness are along the atlantic coast and in the western mountains where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in north america are found{32]{43] the atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the south atlantic pine forests and lower southeast coastal plain maritime flora the latter found primarily in eastern and central virginiawhite-tailed deer also known as virginia deer graze at big meadows in shenandoah national parkmammals include white-tailed deer black bear beaver bobcat coyote raccoon skunk groundhog virginia opossum gray fox red fox and eastern cottontail rabbit{44] other mammals include: nutria fox squirrel gray squirrel flying squirrel chipmunk brown bat and weasel birds include cardinals (the state bird) barred owls carolina chickadees red-tailed hawks ospreys brown pelicans quail seagulls bald eagles and wild turkeys virginia is also home to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker the peregrine falcon was reintroduced into shenandoah national park in the mid-1990s{45] walleye brook trout roanoke bass and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish{46] running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders{32] the chesapeake bay is host to many species including blue crabs clams oysters and rockfish (also known as striped bass){47]virginia has 30 national park service units such as great falls park and the appalachian trail and one national park the shenandoah national park{48] shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic skyline drive almost 40 of the park's area (79579xc2xa0acres322xc2xa0km2) has been designated as wilderness under the national wilderness preservation system{49] additionally there are 34 virginia state parks and 17 state forests run by the department of conservation and recreation and the department of forestry{41]{50] the chesapeake bay while not a national park is protected by both state and federal legislation and the jointly run chesapeake bay program which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed the great dismal swamp national wildlife refuge extends into north carolina as does the back bay national wildlife refuge which marks the beginning of the outer banks{51]historymain article: history of virginiathe story of pocahontas an ancestress of many of the first families of virginia was romanticized by later artists{52]"jamestown 2007" marked virginia's quadricentennial year celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the jamestown colony the celebrations highlighted contributions from native americans africans and europeans each of which had a significant part in shaping virginia's history{53]{54] warfare including among these groups has also had an important role virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the french and indian war the american revolution and the civil war to the cold war and the war on terrorism{55] stories about historic figures such as those surrounding pocahontas and john smith george washington's childhood or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period have also created potent myths of state history and have served as rationales for virginia's ideology{56]colonymain article: colony of virginiathe first people are estimated to have arrived in virginia over 12000xc2xa0years ago{57] by 5000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged and farming began by 900 ad by 1500 the algonquian peoples had founded towns such as werowocomoco in the tidewater region which they referred to as tsenacommacah the other major language groups in the area were the siouan to the west and the iroquoians who included the nottoway and meherrin to the north and south after 1570 the algonquians consolidated under chief powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network{58] powhatan controlled more than 30xc2xa0smaller tribes and over 150xc2xa0settlements who shared a common virginia algonquian language in 1607 the native tidewater population was between 13000 and 14000{59]several european expeditions including a group of spanish jesuits explored the chesapeake bay during the 16th century{60] in 1583 queen elizabeth i of england granted walter raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of spanish florida{61] in 1584 raleigh sent an expedition to the atlantic coast of north america{62] the name "virginia" may have been suggested then by raleigh or elizabeth perhaps noting her status as the "virgin queen" and may also be related to a native phrase "wingandacoa" or name "wingina"{63] initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from south carolina to maine plus the island of bermuda{64] later subsequent royal charters modified the colony's boundaries the london company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary charter of 1606 which granted land rights to this area the company financed the first permanent english settlement in the "new world" jamestown named for king james i it was founded in may 1607 by christopher newport{65] in 1619 colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the house of burgesses with the bankruptcy of the london company in 1624 the settlement was taken into royal authority as an english crown colony{66]williamsburg was virginia's capital from 1699 to 1780life in the colony was perilous and many died during the starving time in 1609 and the anglo-powhatan wars including the indian massacre of 1622 which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes{67] by 1624 only 3400xc2xa0of the 6000xc2xa0early settlers had survived{68] however european demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants{69] the headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to virginia{70] african workers were first imported to jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude the shift to a system of african slavery in virginia was propelled by the legal cases of john punch who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away{71] and of john casor who was claimed by anthony johnson as his servant for life in 1655{72] slavery first appears in virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662 when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status{73]tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to bacon's rebellion in 1676 by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80 of the population{74] rebels largely from the colony's frontier were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes and one result of the rebellion was the signing at middle plantation of the treaty of 1677 which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty middle plantation saw the founding of the college of william  mary in 1693 and was renamed williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699{75] in 1747 a group of virginian speculators formed the ohio company with the backing of the british crown to start english settlement and trade in the ohio country west of the appalachian mountains{76] france which claimed this area as part of their colony of new france viewed this as a threat and the ensuing french and indian war became part of the seven years' war (1756xe2x80x931763) a militia from several british colonies called the virginia regiment was led by then-lieutenant colonel george washington{77]statehood1851 painting of patrick henry's speech before the house of burgesses on the virginia resolves against the stamp act of 1765the british parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the french and indian war were deeply unpopular in the colonies in the house of burgesses opposition to taxation without representation was led by patrick henry and richard henry lee among others{78] virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the continental congress the following year{79] after the house of burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774 virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the virginia conventions on may 15 1776 the convention declared virginia's independence from the british empire and adopted george mason's virginia declaration of rights which was then included in a new constitution{80] another virginian thomas jefferson drew upon mason's work in drafting the national declaration of independence{81]when the american revolutionary war began george washington was selected to head the colonial army during the war the capital was moved to richmond at the urging of governor thomas jefferson who feared that williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to british attack{82] in 1781 the combined action of continental and french land and naval forces trapped the british army on the virginia peninsula where troops under george washington and comte de rochambeau defeated british general cornwallis in the siege of yorktown his surrender on october 19 1781 led to peace negotiations in paris and secured the independence of the colonies{83]virginians were instrumental in writing the united states constitution james madison drafted the virginia plan in 1787 and the bill of rights in 1789{81] virginia ratified the constitution on june 25 1788 the three-fifths compromise ensured that virginia with its large number of slaves initially had the largest bloc in the house of representatives together with the virginia dynasty of presidents this gave the commonwealth national importance in 1790 both virginia and maryland ceded territory to form the new district of columbia though the virginian area was retroceded in 1846{84] virginia is called "mother of states" because of its role in being carved into states like kentucky which became the 15th state in 1792 and for the numbers of american pioneers born in virginia{85]civil war and aftermathmain article: virginia in the american civil warunion soldiers before marye's heights fredericksburg in may 1863in addition to agriculture slave labor was increasingly used in mining shipbuilding and other industries{86] the execution of gabriel prosser in 1800 nat turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and john brown's raid on harpers ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy by 1860 almost half a million people roughly 31 of the total population of virginia were enslaved{87]{88] this division contributed to the start of the american civil warvirginia voted to secede from the united states on april 17 1861 after the battle of fort sumter and abraham lincoln's call for volunteers on april 24 virginia joined the confederate states of america which chose richmond as its capital{85] after the 1861 wheeling convention 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of west virginia which chose to remain loyal to the union virginian general robert e lee took command of the army of northern virginia in 1862 and led invasions into union territory ultimately becoming commander of all confederate forces during the war more battles were fought in virginia than anywhere else including bull run the seven days battles chancellorsville and the concluding battle of appomattox court house{89] after the capture of richmond in april 1865 the state capital was briefly moved to lynchburg{90] while the confederate leadership fled to danville{91] virginia was formally restored to the united states in 1870 due to the work of the committee of nine{92]during the post-war reconstruction era virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools and guaranteed political civil and voting rights{93] the populist readjuster party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white democratic party gained power after 1883{94] it passed segregationist jim crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the constitution of virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most african americans and many poor european americans{95] though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation african americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in virginia society{96]post-reconstructionmany pre-dreadnought and world war i-era warships were built in newport news including the uss virginianew economic forces also changed the commonwealth virginian james albert bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered on richmond in 1886 railroad magnate collis potter huntington founded newport news shipbuilding which was responsible for building six major world war i-era battleships for the us navy from 1907 to 1923{97] during the war german submarines like u-151 attacked ships outside the port{98] in 1926 dr war goodwin rector of williamsburg's bruton parish church began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of john d rockefeller jr{99] though their project like others in the state had to contend with the great depression and world war ii work continued as colonial williamsburg became a major tourist attraction{100]the virginia civil rights memorial was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregationprotests started by barbara rose johns in 1951 in farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit davis v county school board of prince edward county this case filed by richmond natives spottswood robinson and oliver hill was decided in 1954 with brown v board of education which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal" but in 1958 under the policy of "massive resistance" led by the influential segregationist senator harry f byrd and his byrd organization the commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding{101]the civil rights movement gained many participants in the 1960s it achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 in 1964 the united states supreme court ordered prince edward county and others to integrate schools{102] in 1967 the court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with loving v virginia from 1969 to 1971 state legislators under governor mills godwin rewrote the constitution after goals such as the repeal of jim crow laws had been achieved in 1989 douglas wilder became the first african american elected as governor in the united states{103]the cold war led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in northern virginia near washington dc and correlative population growth{104] the central intelligence agency in langley was involved in various cold war events including as the target of soviet espionage activities also among the federal developments was the pentagon built during world war ii as the headquarters for the department of defense it was one of the targets of the september 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was crashed into the building{105]cities and townsmain article: political subdivisions of virginiaxc2xa0vtelargest cities or towns in virginiasource:{106]ranknamecountypopvirginia

century virginia shifted from a largely rural politically southern and conservative state to a more urbanized pluralistic and politically moderate environment up until the 1970s virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the byrd organization{293] the legacy of slavery in the state effectively disfranchised african americans until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s{294] enfranchisement and immigration of other groups especially hispanics have placed growing importance on minority voting{295] while voters that identify as "white working-class" declined by three percent between 2008 and 2012{296] regional differences play a large part in virginia politics{297] rural southern and western areas moved to support the republican party in response to its "southern strategy" while urban and growing suburban areas including much of northern virginia form the democratic party base{298]{299] democratic support also persists in union-influenced roanoke in southwest virginia college towns such as charlottesville and blacksburg and the southeastern black belt region{300]political party strength in virginia has likewise been in flux in the 2007 state elections democrats regained control of the state senate and narrowed the republican majority in the house of delegates to eight seats{301] yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of republican bob mcdonnell as governor by a seventeen-point margin the election of a republican lieutenant governor and attorney general as well as republican gains of six seats in the house of delegates{302] in 2011 the republican caucus took over two-thirds (68xe2x80x9332) of the seats in the house of delegates and a majority of the senate based on the lieutenant governor bill bolling as

in wakefield{309]in federal elections since 2006 both parties have seen successes republican senator george allen lost close races in 2006 to democratic newcomer jim webb and again in 2012 to webb's replacement former governor tim kaine{310] in 2008 democrats won both united states senate seats; former governor mark warner was elected to replace retiring republican john warner{311] the state went

franchise{313] the reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state the proximity of teams in washington dc and north carolina and a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums{314]{315] however in recent years the city of virginia beach has proposed a new arena designed to lure a major league franchise norfolk is host to two minor league teams: the aaa norfolk tides and the echl's norfolk admirals the san francisco giants' aa team the richmond flying squirrels began play at the diamond in 2010 replacing the aaa richmond braves who relocated after 2008{316]

state symbolsthe state slogan "virginia is for lovers" was developed in 1968 and is featured on the state's welcome signsthe state nickname is its oldest symbol though it has never been made official by law virginia was given the title "dominion" by king charles ii of england at the time of the restoration because it had remained loyal to the crown during the english civil war and the present moniker "old dominion" is a reference to that title charles' supporters were called cavaliers and "the cavalier state" nickname was popularized after the american civil war to romanticize the antebellum period sports teams from the university of virginia are called the cavaliers{322] the other nickname "mother of presidents" is also historic as eight virginians have served as president of the united states including four of the first five{1]the state's motto sic semper tyrannis translates from latin as "thus always to tyrants" and is used on the state seal which is then used on the flag while the seal was designed in 1776 and the flag was first used in the 1830s both were made official in 1930{1] the majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century{323] the virginia reel is among the square dances classified as the state dance{12] in march 2015 after 20 years without a state song virginia received two: "our great virginia" (official traditional state song) and "sweet virginia breeze" (official popular state song){324] in 1940 virginia made "carry me back to old virginny" the state song but it was retired in 1997 and reclassified as the state song
