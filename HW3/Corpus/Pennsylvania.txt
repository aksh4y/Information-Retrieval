the dutch and the english claimed both sides of the delaware river as part of their colonial lands in america{20]{21]{22] the dutch were the first to take possession{22]by june 3 1631 the dutch had begun settling the delmarva peninsula by establishing the zwaanendael colony on the site of present-day lewes delaware{23] in 1638 sweden established the new sweden colony in the region of fort christina on the site of present-day wilmington delaware new sweden claimed and for the most part controlled the lower delaware river region (parts of present-day delaware new jersey and pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there{24]{25]penn's treaty with the indians by edward hickson march 12 1664 king charles ii of england gave james duke of york a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original virginia company of plymouth grant plus other lands this grant was in conflict with the dutch claim for new netherland which included parts of today's pennsylvania{26]on june 24 1664 the duke of york sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day new jersey to john berkeley and george carteret for a proprietary colony the land was not yet in british possession but the sale boxed in the portion of new netherland on the west side of the delaware river the british conquest of new netherland began on august 29 1664 when new amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on british ships in new york harbor{27]{28] this conquest continued and was completed in october 1664 when the british captured fort casimir in what today is new castle delawarejohn dickinsonthe peace of breda between england france and the netherlands confirmed the english conquest on july 21 1667{29]{30] although there were temporary reversionson september 12 1672 as part of the third anglo-dutch war the dutch re-conquered new york colonynew amsterdam the dutch established three county courts which went on to become original counties in present-day delaware and pennsylvania the one that later transferred to pennsylvania was upland{31] this was partially reversed on february 9 1674 when the treaty of westminster ended the third anglo-dutch war and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum the british retained the dutch counties with their dutch names{32] by june 11 1674 new york reasserted control over the outlying colonies including upland but the names started to be changed to british names by november 11 1674{33] upland was partitioned on november 12 1674 producing the general outline of the current border between pennsylvania and delaware{34]on february 28 1681 charles ii granted a land charter{35] to william penn to repay a debt of xc2xa316000{36] (around xc2xa32100000 in 2008 adjusting for retail inflation){37] owed to william's father admiral william penn this was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history{38] the king named it pennsylvania (literally "penn's woods") in honor of the admiral penn the son who wanted it to be called new wales and then sylvania (from the latin silva: "forest woods") was embarrassed at the change fearing that people would think he had named it after himself but king charles would not rename the grant{39] penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the new world: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction{38]a mapp of ye improved part of pensilvania in america divided into countyes townships and lottswhat had been upland on what became the pennsylvania side of the pennsylvania-delaware border was renamed as chester county when pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on march 4 1681{40]{41] the quaker leader william penn had signed a peace treaty with tammany leader of the delaware tribe beginning a long period of friendly relations between the quakers and the indians{42] additional treaties between quakers and other tribes followed the treaty of william penn was never violated{43]18th century{edit]between 1730 and when it was shut down by parliament with the currency act of 1764 the pennsylvania colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver the paper money was called colonial scrip the colony issued "bills of credit" which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution it was an interest-free proposition largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people it also promoted general employment and prosperity since the government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency benjamin franklin had a hand in creating this currency of which he said its utility was never to be disputed and it also met with the "cautious approval" of adam smith{44]james smith wrote that in 1763 "the indians again commenced hostilities and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of pennsylvania" further "this state was then a quaker government and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state"{45] the ensuing hostilities became known as pontiac's warpresident's house (philadelphia) the masters-penn mansion housed pennsylvania's governor in the early 1770s it later served as the presidential mansion of george washington and john adams 1790xe2x80x931800 while philadelphia was the temporary national capitalafter the stamp act congress of 1765 delegate john dickinson of philadelphia wrote the declaration of rights and grievances the congress was the first meeting of the thirteen colonies called at the request of the massachusetts assembly but only nine colonies sent delegates{46] dickinson then wrote letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the british colonies which were published in the pennsylvania chronicle between december 2 1767 and february 15 1768{47]when the founding fathers of the united states convened in philadelphia in 1774 12 colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress{48] the second continental congress which also met in philadelphia (in may 1775) drew up and signed the declaration of independence in philadelphia{49] but when that city was captured by the british the continental congress escaped westward meeting at the lancaster courthouse on saturday september 27 1777 and then to york there they and its primary author john dickinson drew up the articles of confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation later the constitution was written and philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new american nation{50] the constitution was drafted and signed at the pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall and the same building where the declaration of independence was signed{51]pennsylvania became the first large state and the second state to ratify the us constitution on december 12 1787{52] five days after delaware became the first at the time it was the most ethically and religiously diverse of the thirteen colonies because one-third of pennsylvaniaxe2x80x99s population spoke german the constitution was presented in german to include those citizens in the discussion reverend frederick muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the state's ratifying convention{53]dickinson college of carlisle was the first college founded in the united states established in 1773 the college was ratified five days after the treaty of paris on september 9 1783 the school was founded by benjamin rush and named after john dickinsonthe "hills capitol" used from 1821 until it burned down in 1897for half a century the commonwealth's general assembly (legislature) met at various places in the general philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in independence hall in philadelphia for 63 years{54] but it needed a more central location as for example the paxton boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware so in 1799 the general assembly moved to the lancaster courthouse{54] and finally in 1812 to harrisburg{54]19th century{edit]the general assembly met in the old dauphin county court house until december 1821{54] when the federal-style "hills capitol" (named for its builder stephen hills a lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient entrepreneurial son and namesake of john harris sr a yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore of the susquehanna river{55] the hills capitol burned down on february 2 1897 during a heavy snowstorm presumably because of a faulty flue{54] the general assembly met at grace methodist church on state street (still standing) until a new capitol could be built following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been "rigged" chicago architect henry ives cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building; however the legislature had little money to allocate to the project and a roughly finished somewhat industrial building (the cobb capitol) was completed the general assembly refused to occupy the building political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to pennsylvania architects and joseph miller huston of philadelphia was chosen to design the present pennsylvania state capitol that incorporated cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907{54]the new state capitol drew rave reviews{54] its dome was inspired by the domes of st peter's basilica in rome and the united states capitol{54] president theodore roosevelt called it "the most beautiful state capital in the nation" and said "it's the handsomest building i ever saw" at the dedication in 1989 the new york times praised it as "grand even awesome at moments but it is also a working building accessible to citizens  a building that connects with the reality of daily life"{54]james buchanan of franklin county the only bachelor president of the united states{56]

826 between 2000 and 2010 making it one of the largest increases in a state's hispanic population the significant growth of the hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from puerto rico which is a us territory but to a lesser extent from countries such as the dominican republic mexico and various central and south american nations as well as from the wave of hispanics leaving new york and new jersey for safer and more affordable living the asian population swelled by almost 60 which was fueled by indian vietnamese and chinese immigration as well the many asian transplants moving to philadelphia from new york the rapid growth of this community has given pennsylvania one of the largest asian populations in the nation by numerical values the black and african american population grew by 13 which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (new york new jersey ohio illinois and michigan)the white population declined by 07 a trend

pennsylvania's reported population of hispanics especially among the black race has markedly increased in recent years{73] the hispanic population is greatest in hazleton allentown reading lancaster york and around philadelphia it is not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness to self-identify minority status as of 2010 it is
