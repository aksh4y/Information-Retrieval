equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the "ton of tnt" is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4184 gigajoules{1] which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton (1000 kilograms or one megagram) of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energycontents1 kiloton and megaton2 historical derivation of

energy equal to 4184 terajoulesthe "megaton (of tnt)" is a unit of energy equal to 4184 petajoulesthe kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact{2]historical derivation of the value{edit]a gram of tnt releases 2673xe2x80x936702xc2xa0j (joules) upon explosion{3] the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184xc2xa0j{4] which is exactly one kilocaloriean explosive's energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686xc2xa0jg from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853xc2xa0jg{5]the measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724xc2xa0j{6]{clarification needed] but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculationsalternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared{7]{8]{9]{10]a kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 846 metres (278xc2xa0ft) on a sidegrams tntsymboltons
