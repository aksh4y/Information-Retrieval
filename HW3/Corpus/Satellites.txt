context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth's moonin 1957 the soviet union launched the world's first artificial satellite sputnik 1 since then about 6600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2013 estimate 3600 remained in orbit{1] of those about 1000 were operational;{2] while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit (at 20000xc2xa0km) and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36000xc2xa0km){3] a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids{4] and the sunsatellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known (overlapping) classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbita launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit)satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks

system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellitethe first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon{5]{6] the idea surfaced again in jules verne's the begum's fortune (1879)konstantin tsiolkovskyin 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky (1857xe2x80x931935) published exploring space using jet propulsion devices (in russian: xd0x98xd1x81xd1x81xd0xbbxd0xb5xd0xb4xd0xbexd0xb2xd0xb0xd0xbdxd0xb8xd0xb5 xd0xbcxd0xb8xd1x80xd0xbexd0xb2xd1x8bxd1x85

the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve thisin 1928 herman potoxc4x8dnik (1892xe2x80x931929) published his sole book the problem of space travel xe2x80x94 the rocket motor (german: das problem der befahrung des weltraums xe2x80x94 der raketen-motor) he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experimentsanimation depicting the orbits of gps satellites in medium earth orbitin a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke (1917xe2x80x932008) described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications{7] he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planetthe us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services{8]artificial satellites{edit]sputnik 1: the first artificial satellite to orbit earththe first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united statessputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1's success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold warsputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika{9]in may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated "a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century"{10] the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air force's project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the secretary of defense stated "i know of no american satellite program"{11] in february 1954 project rand released "scientific uses for a satellite vehicle" written by rr carhart{12] this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with "the scientific use of an artificial satellite" by hk kallmann and ww kellogg{13]in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year (1957xe2x80x9358) the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the us intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs: the army's which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civiliannavy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed: initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded; explorer 1 became the united states' first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958{14]in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites{15]early satellites were constructed as "one-off" designs with growth in geosynchronous (geo) satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station1u cubesat estcube-1 developed mainly by the students from the university of tartu carries out a tether deployment experiment in low earth orbitspace surveillance network{edit]main article: united states space surveillance networkthe united states space surveillance network (ssn) a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earth's orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earth's atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites (ie 560 satellites) the rest are space debris{16] the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missilesnon-military satellite services{edit]there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:{17]fixed satellite services{edit]fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth's surfacemobile satellite systems{edit]mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world andor other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems scientific research satellites (commercial and noncommercial){edit]scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data (eg remote sensing) amateur (ham) radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric researchtypes{edit]astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objectsbiosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentationcommunications satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits molniya orbits or low earth orbitsearth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc (see especially earth observing system)navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time"killer satellites" are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assetscrewed spacecraft (spaceships) are large satellites able to put humans into (and beyond) an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stationsminiaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes{18] new classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500xe2x80x93100xc2xa0kg) microsatellite (below 100xc2xa0kg) nanosatellite (below 10xc2xa0kg){citation needed]reconnaissance satellites are earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classifiedrecovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earthinternational space stationspace stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space a space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit for periods of weeks months or even yearstether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tetherweather satellites are primarily used to monitor earth's weather and climate{19]orbit types{edit]main article: list

global positioning system (gps) satellites and the red dotted line the orbit of the international space station (iss)the first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1459{20] artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricitythe commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit (leo) medium earth orbit (meo) and high earth orbit (heo) low earth orbit is any orbit below 2000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2000 and 35786xc2xa0km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35786xc2xa0kmcentric classifications{edit]geocentric orbit: an orbit around the

(specifically russia and the united states)tundra orbit: a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 634xc2xb0 and orbital period of one sidereal day (roughly 24 hours) such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planetsynchronous classifications{edit]synchronous orbit: an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period (earth's is: 23 hours 56 minutes 4091 seconds) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in

an orbit with an inclination of more than 90xc2xb0 or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitudehalo orbit and lissajous orbit: orbits "around" lagrangian pointssatellite subsystems{edit]the satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the "anatomy" of a typical satellite one discovers two modules{17] note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomyspacecraft bus or service module{edit]the bus module consists of the following subsystems:structural subsystem{edit]the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damagetelemetry subsystem{edit]the telemetry subsystem (aka command and data handling cdh) monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustmentspower subsystem{edit]the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earth's shadow nuclear power sources (radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program (1964xe2x80x931978){22]thermal control subsystem{edit]main article: spacecraft thermal controlthe thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (eg optical solar reflector)attitude and orbit control subsystem{edit]main articles: attitude control and spacecraft propulsionthe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators (reaction wheels thrusters) these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directionscommunication payload{edit]the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable ofxc2xa0:receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas)amplifying received radio signalssorting the input signals and directing the output signals through inputoutput signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas)end of life{edit]when satellites reach the end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch) satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009{23]instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit{24] as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch{25] in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level) the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78xc2xa0km with a range between 72 and 84xc2xa0km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95xc2xa0km{26]launch-capable countries{edit]main article: timeline of first orbital launches by nationalitythis list includes countries

they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming{107]{108] but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming{109]{110]also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively{citation
