hurricane seasonhurricane felix was the southernmost landfalling category 5 hurricane in the atlantic; surpassing hurricane edith of 1971 it was the sixth named storm second hurricane and second category 5 hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season felix formed from a tropical wave on august 31 passing through the southern windward islands on september 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status a day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane and early on september 3 it was upgraded to categoryxc2xa05xc2xa0status; by 2100xc2xa0utc the hurricane was downgraded to categoryxc2xa04 status but was upgraded to a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of september 4on september 4 felix made landfall just south of the border between nicaragua and honduras in the mosquito coast region as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane with 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) winds hurricane felix struck nicaragua on the same day as hurricane henriette struck the baja california peninsula in the eastern pacific ocean which marked the second recorded occurrence that a north atlantic hurricane and a pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day;{1] the previous occurrence was on august 23 1992 when hurricane andrew hit the bahamas on the same day hurricane lester hit mexico's baja california peninsula at least 133xc2xa0deaths are attributed to

the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 24 tracking westward at approximately 14xc2xa0mph (23xc2xa0kmh) with no associated deep convection and a weak low-level inverted-v curvature{2]{3] initially difficult to locate on satellites{4] the wave axis tracked through a moist environment{5] and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms by august 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the intertropical convergence zone{6] the wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection and on august 27 a 1012xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2988xc2xa0inhg) low pressure area developed about 830xc2xa0mi (1340xc2xa0km) west-southwest of praia cape verde{7] for the next several days the system failed to organize significantly;{8] however on august 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low{9] convection increased early the next day{10] and a hurricane hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low-level circulation; accordingly the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression six at 2100xc2xa0utc on august 31 while it was located about 180xc2xa0mi (295xc2xa0km) east-southeast of the southern windward islands{11]upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge resulting in a west-northwest motion the system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development{11] its deep convection consolidated very near the center and shortly after passing over the island of grenada the depression intensified into tropical storm felix early at around 0900xc2xa0utc on september 1{12] felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly-wound bands around the center{13] and by late on september 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery{14] based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft the national hurricane center estimated that felix attained hurricane status by early on september 2 while located about 155xc2xa0mi (250xc2xa0km) east-northeast of bonaire{15]hurricane felix rapidly intensifying south of hispaniola on september 2tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content felix quickly developed a well-defined eye a symmetric cloud structure and strong upper-level outflow;{16] consequently the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800xc2xa0utc on september 2 while located about 490xc2xa0mi (790xc2xa0km) southeast of kingston jamaica{17] rapid strengthening continued and later that day the hurricane attained categoryxc2xa04 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with the pressure dropping to 957xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2826xc2xa0inhg); this corresponded to a falling rate of 34xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 01xc2xa0inhg) per hour which the national hurricane center described as "one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed" a hurricane hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14xc2xa0mi (22xc2xa0km){18] a subsequent hurricane hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) with peak surface winds of 163xc2xa0mph (263xc2xa0kmh) reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall; surface winds of 189xc2xa0mph (306xc2xa0kmh) were found in its northeastern quadrant although the national hurricane center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds based on the observations it is estimated felix attained winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) by 0000xc2xa0utc on september 3 while located about 390xc2xa0mi (625xc2xa0km) southeast of kingston jamaica making felix a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale while investigating the hurricane hurricane hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel which forced the flight to abort the mission{19]continuing quickly westward the diameter of the eye decreased to 12xc2xa0mi (19xc2xa0km){20] and the national hurricane center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2743xc2xa0inhg) about seven hours after it reached categoryxc2xa05 status{2] initially felix was predicted to track west-northwestward striking belize before crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula;{20] however its path remained nearly due westward subsequently cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct{21] and by 1800xc2xa0utc on september 3 felix weakened to categoryxc2xa04 status with winds of 145xc2xa0mph (235xc2xa0kmh){22] on september 4 felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day{23] felix was upgraded to a categoryxc2xa05 for the second time at 1040xc2xa0utc{24] and made landfall in extreme north-eastern nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){25] by nine hours after moving ashore the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands although the winds rapidly decreased;{26] early on september 5 felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion{27] the system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern honduras and at 0900xc2xa0utc the national hurricane center issued the last advisory on felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area{28] the remnants of felix tracked west-northwestward over other portions of latin america and eventually dissipated over the mexican state of tabasco on september 7{2]preparations{edit]hurricane felix in the western caribbean sea nearing central america on september 3upon felix's becoming a tropical cyclone a tropical storm warning was issued for saint vincent and the grenadines tobago and grenada and its dependencies; a tropical storm watch was also issued for the northeastern venezuela coast from cumanxc3xa1 to pedernales including isla margarita as well as the abc islands{29] the national emergency management agency of tobago was fully activated with 79xc2xa0shelters opened on the island{30] coinciding with the upgrade of felix to tropical storm status the watch for the abc islands was upgraded to a tropical storm warning{31] a hurricane watch was added to the islands early on september 2{32] where several tourists attempted to leave by plane prior to the arrival of the storm{33] early on september 2 the government of jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the island{15] which was canceled as the hurricane passed far to its south{22] later on september 2 a tropical storm watch was issued for grand cayman{34] and the next day a tropical storm warning was put in place on providencia island{35] a hurricane watch was issued for the caribbean coast of guatemala and the entire coastline of belize at 1200xc2xa0utc on september 3{36]at 0300xc2xa0utc on september 3 the government of honduras issued a hurricane watch from limxc3xb3n to the hondurasnicaragua border{37] which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later at the same time a hurricane watch was extended westward to the hondurasguatemala border{38] and early on september 4 a tropical storm warning was put in place for the same region{39] officials ordered evacuations for citizens in low-lying areas near the coastline; by midday on september 3 around 300xc2xa0tourists evacuated from the bay islands department with an additional 400 preparing to leave by plane;{40] approximately 2000xc2xa0people were evacuated from coastal areas{41] by the time the hurricane made landfall about 20000xc2xa0people in honduras left for safer areas{42]at 1500xc2xa0utc on september 3 about 21xc2xa0hours before its final landfall the government of nicaragua issued a hurricane warning from puerto cabezas northward to the national border{43] about 12xc2xa0hours before landfall a tropical storm warning was issued from puerto cabezas southward to prinzapolka{39] prior to the arrival of the hurricane officials sent about 140000xc2xa0lbs (63000xc2xa0kg) of meals and emergency supplies to near the landfall location{44]impact{edit]caribbean islands{edit]felix passing arubaat around 1200xc2xa0utc on september 1 a wind gust of 46xc2xa0mph (74xc2xa0kmh) was recorded on barbados and around the same time a gust of 44xc2xa0mph (71xc2xa0kmh) was observed in saint vincent{45] the storm produced heavy rainfall across the windward islands on trinidad heavy precipitation caused mudslides and overflown rivers which destroyed some bridges; moderate winds damaged several buildings on the island damage on neighboring tobago was concentrated on its northern portion where several mudslides resulted from the rainfall;{46] monetary damage on tobago was estimated at 250000 (2007xc2xa0ttd; 40000xc2xa02007xc2xa0usd 462xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd){47] felix produced gusty winds on grenada which downed several power lines and destroyed the roofs of two houses; rough waves also broke several vessels from their anchors{33] in st lucia winds from the storm damaged the roof of a store in castries which collapsed and destroyed 12xc2xa0vehicles{46]in the abc islands the hurricane resulted in gusty winds and heavy rainfall however little damage was reported in bonaire; the precipitation left several homes submerged under water in curaxc3xa7ao in aruba the winds damaged one house and briefly left a northern town without power{40] hurricane felix produced strong winds and 10xc2xa0ft (3xc2xa0m) waves along the north coast of venezuela which left one person missing in puerto cabello{48]central america{edit]hurricane felix after its landfall in nicaragua on september 4early reports suggest severe damage in honduras and nicaragua after felix made landfall as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane in puerto cabezas nearly every structure sustained at least roof damage and many buildings were destroyed along the mosquito coast flooding and mudslides were reported destroying many houses and blocking highways the government of nicaragua declared the northern caribbean coast a disaster area{49] the miskito cays located about 43xc2xa0mi (69xc2xa0km) from bilwi on the northeast coast of nicaragua was among the strongest hit areas hurricane felix had not yet made landfall but reached maximum force when it passed over the miskito cays the winds of the hurricane with speeds of up to 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) destroyed the cays completely pillars that previously formed the base of the houses were the only remains on the cays{50]at least 133xc2xa0people were reported dead at least 130 of them were in nicaragua{51] while few details have been disclosed they include at least 25 dead miskito fishermen swept away a drowning death on a boat impact from a fallen tree and at least one indirect death caused by medical complications after birth{49] there were three deaths reported in honduras one of which was caused by a motor vehicle accident caused by heavy rain and landslides and two caused by flooding in the capital city of tegucigalpa{52] however hundreds of others were missing (mostly at sea) and communication was difficult to impossible in many areas some survivors were also found on the mosquito coast who were initially reported missing{53]according to official information at least 40000xc2xa0people were affected and 9000xc2xa0houses destroyed most of them in the nicaraguan city of bilwi (puerto cabezas) where a "state of disaster" was decreed by the government a total lack of supplies and services were also reported in the area the response was almost immediate help from venezuela cuba the united states and honduras was received and a lot of organizations such as the nicaraguan red cross the media and universities organized collections all over the country nicaraguan president daniel ortega visited bilwi on the day after the catastrophe and promised the reconstruction of houses to the people affected{54] damage in nicaragua totaled 134xc2xa0billion (2007xc2xa0nio; 7163xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd 827xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){55]{56]inland flooding was also reported in honduras particularly near tegucigalpa and in the northwestern regions where the ulua river and the chamelecon river overflowed into an agricultural area coastal flooding also damages the town of izabal in guatemala where 850xc2xa0people were evacuated{52] crop damage in honduras amounted to l6828xc2xa0million (2007xc2xa0hnl; 364xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd 42xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){57]aftermath{edit]after felix over 160000xc2xa0people were suffering as many communities were stranded due to the storm an appeal was given out by the united nations for over 48xc2xa0million (2007 usd 554xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in emergency aid to the hard-hit areas particularly in nicaragua{58] the appeal united states federal government delivered over 117xc2xa0million (2007 usd 135xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) in assistance{59] and the european union responded with a donation of xe2x82xac1xc2xa0million euros (136xc2xa0million 2007 usd 157xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){60] the united states agency for international development (usaid) and the office of foreign disaster
