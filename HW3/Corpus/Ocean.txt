of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere{2] on earth an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the world ocean these are in descending order by area the pacific atlantic indian southern (antarctic) and arctic oceans{3]{4] the word sea is often used interchangeably with "ocean" in american english but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land{5]saline water covers approximately 360000000xc2xa0km2 (140000000xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas with the ocean covering approximately 71 of earth's surface and 90 of the earth's biosphere{6] the ocean contains 97 of earth's water and oceanographers have stated that less than 5 of the world ocean has been explored{6] the total volume is approximately 135 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3700 meters (12100xc2xa0ft){7]{8]{9]as the world ocean is the principal component of earth's hydrosphere it is integral to life forms part of the carbon cycle and influences climate and weather patterns the world ocean is the habitat of 230000 known species but because much of it is unexplored the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger possibly over two million{10] the origin of earth's oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the hadean eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of lifeextraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds the only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of titan although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the solar system early in their geologic histories mars and venus are theorized to have had large water oceans the mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of venus compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably the ocean of europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of earth the solar system's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with

based on depth and biophysical conditionsoceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical zones defined by physical and biological conditions the pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance the photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200xc2xa0m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is therefore the most biodiverse because plants require photosynthesis life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200xc2xa0m) the pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagicthe pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature the mesopelagic is the uppermost region its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12xc2xa0xc2xb0c (54xc2xa0xc2xb0f) which in the tropics generally lies at 700xe2x80x931000 meters (2300xe2x80x933300xc2xa0ft) next is the bathypelagic lying between 10 and 4xc2xa0xc2xb0c (50 and 39xc2xa0xc2xb0f) typically between 700xe2x80x931000 meters (2300xe2x80x933300xc2xa0ft) and 2000xe2x80x934000 meters (6600xe2x80x9313100xc2xa0ft) lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic whose lower boundary lies at about 6000 meters (20000xc2xa0ft) the last zone includes the deep oceanic trench and is known as the hadalpelagic this lies between 6000xe2x80x9311000 meters (20000xe2x80x9336000xc2xa0ft) and is the deepest oceanic zonethe benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea the bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about 4000 meters (13000xc2xa0ft) the abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4000 and 6000xc2xa0m lastly the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone which is found in oceanic trenchesthe pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone the neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open waterin contrast the littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions it is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the regionthe ocean can be divided into three density zones: the surface zone the pycnocline and the deep zone the surface zone also called the mixed layer refers to the uppermost density zone of the ocean temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action the surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone the surface zone has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2 of the total volume of ocean water the surface zone usually ranges between depths of 500 feet (150xc2xa0m) to 3300 feet (1000xc2xa0m) below ocean surface but this can vary a great deal in some cases the surface zone can be entirely non-existent the surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude the transition to colder denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes the pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature the pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below the pycnocline represents approximately 18 of the total volume of ocean water the deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean the deep zone usually begins at depths below 3300 feet (1000xc2xa0m) in mid-latitudes the deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth the deep zone represents approximately 80 of the total volume of ocean water the deep zone contains relatively colder and stable waterif a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth it contains a thermocline the tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes polar waters which receive relatively little solar energy are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths below the thermocline water is very cold ranging from xe2x88x921xc2xa0xc2xb0c to 3xc2xa0xc2xb0c because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water the average temperature of the world ocean is 39xc2xa0xc2xb0c{citation needed] if a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth it contains a halocline if a zone undergoes a strong vertical chemistry gradient with depth it contains a chemoclinethe halocline often coincides with the thermocline and the combination produces a pronounced pycnoclineexplorationmap of large underwater features (1995 noaa)the deepest point in the ocean is the mariana trench located in the pacific ocean near the northern mariana islands its maximum depth has been estimated to be 10971 meters (35994xc2xa0ft) (plus or minus 11 meters; see the mariana trench article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth) the british naval vessel challenger ii surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the "challenger deep" in 1960 the trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench manned by a crew of two menoceanic maritime currentsoceanic surface currents (us army 1943)amphidromic points showing the direction of tides per incrementation periods along with resonating directions of wavelength movementsoceanic maritime currents have different origins tidal currents are in phase with the tide hence are quasiperiodic they may fomulate various knots in certain places{clarification needed] most notably around headlands non periodic currents have for origin the waves wind and different densitiesthe wind and waves create surface currents (designated as xc2xabxc2xa0drift currentsxc2xa0xc2xbb) these currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of stokes drift under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds)){36] the quasi permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves and in a lesser governing effect by the friction of the wind on the surface{37]this acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind accordingly when the sea depth increases the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed at a certain sea depth the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the ekman spiral the influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth these currents can considerably alter change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons if the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters) the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind becoming virtually homogeneous until the thermocline{38]in the deep however maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the salinity between water density massesin littoral zones breaking wave is so intense and the depth measurement so low that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knotsclimatea map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represent deep-water currents whereas red represent surface currentsocean currents greatly affect earth's climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the polar regions transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions winds may carry them inland surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation it plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions and thus in sea ice regulation changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on earth's energy budget in so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrationsfor a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under global warming see shutdown of thermohaline circulationit is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of western europe is so temperate an alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect and that europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics{39]{40]the antarctic circumpolar current encircles that continent influencing the area's

a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean on average longer than the oceanic mixing time then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean as a result because the

exomoons orbiting planets particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceansterrestrial planets will acquire water during their accretion some of which will be buried in the magma ocean but most of it will go into a steam atmosphere and when the atmosphere cools it will collapse on to the surface forming an ocean there will also be outgassing of water from the mantle as the magma solidifiesxe2x80x94this will happen even for planets with a low percentage of their mass composed of water so "super-earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly

fluids although not liquids do share various properties with liquids underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets uranus and neptune it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot
