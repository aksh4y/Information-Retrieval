the globethe original inhabitants of guam and the northern mariana islands were the chamorro people who are believed to be descendants of austronesian people originating from southeast asia as early as 2000 bc{13]:16the ancient chamorro society had four classes: chamorri (chiefs) matua (upper class) achaot (middle class) and mana'chang (lower class){13]:20xe2x80x9321 the matua were located in the coastal villages which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds whereas the mana'chang were located in the interior of the island matua and mana'chang rarely communicated with each other and matua often used achaot as intermediaries there were also "makxc3xa5hna" (similar to shamans) skilled in healing and medicine belief in spirits of ancient chamorros called "taotao mo'na" still persists as a remnant of pre-european culture their society was organized along matrilineal clans{13]:21latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the mariana islands; they are a recent development in pre-contact chamorro society the latte-stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built{13]:26 latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone called the haligi and with a capstone or txc3xa5sa made either from a large brain coral or limestone placed on top{13]:27xe2x80x9328 a possible source for these stones the rota latte stone quarry was discovered in 1925 on rota{13]:28magellan's travel to guam{edit]the first european to travel to guam was portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan sailing for the king of spain when he sighted the island on march 6 1521 during his fleet's circumnavigation of the globe{13]:41xe2x80x9342 when magellan arrived on guam he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas ("islands of the lateen sails") antonio pigafetta (one of magellan's original 18) said that the name was "island of sails" but he also writes that the inhabitants "entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on" including "the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship"{14]:129 "those people are poor but ingenious and very thievish on account of which we called those three islands islas de los ladrones ("islands of thieves")"{14]:131spanish colonization and the manila galleons{edit]despite magellan's visit guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26 1565 by general miguel lxc3xb3pez de legazpi{13]:46 from 1565 to 1815 guam and the northern mariana islands the only spanish outpost in the pacific ocean east of the philippines was an important resting stop for the manila galleons a fleet that covered the pacific trade route between acapulco and manila{13]:51 to protect these pacific fleets spain built several defensive structures that still stand today such as fort nuestra sexc3xb1ora de la soledad in umatac guam is the biggest single segment of micronesia the largest islands between the island of kyushu (japan) new guinea the philippines and the hawaiian islandsspanish colonization commenced on june 15 1668 with the arrival of diego luis de san vitores and pedro calungsod who established the first catholic church{13]:64 the islands were part of the spanish east indies governed from the philippines which were in turn part of the viceroyalty of new spain based in mexico city other reminders of colonial times include the old governor's palace in plaza de espaxc3xb1a and the spanish bridge both in hagatxc3xb1a guam's cathedral dulce nombre de maria was formally opened on february 2 1669 as was the royal college of san juan de letran{13]:68 guam along with the rest of the mariana and caroline islands were treated as part of spain's colony in the philippines while the island's chamorro culture has indigenous roots the cultures of both guam and the northern marianas have many similarities with spanish culture due to three centuries of spanish rule{5]internal conflicts{edit]intermittent warfare lasting from july 23 1670 until july 1695 plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693 and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688 reduced the chamorro population from 50000 to 10000 to less than 5000{13]:86 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forces{13]:68xe2x80x9374after his arrival in 1674 captain damian de esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as chochogo pepura tumon sidia-aty sagua nagan and ninca{13]:74xe2x80x9375 starting in june 1676 the first spanish governor of guam capt francisco de irrisarri y vinar controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions he also ordered the construction of schools roads and other infrastructure{13]:75xe2x80x9376 later capt jose de quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors he also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated father san vitores resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands eventually leading to the death of matapang hurao and aguarin{13]:77xe2x80x9378 quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to guam ordering the population to live in a few large villages{13]:78xe2x80x9379 these included jinapsan umatac pago agat and inarajan where he built a number of churches{13]:79 by july 1695 quiroga had completed the conquest of guam rota tinian and aguigan{13]:85expulsion of the jesuits{edit]on february 26 1767 charles iii of spain issued a decree confiscating the property of the jesuits and banishing them from spain and her possessions{13]:101 as a consequence the jesuit fathers on guam departed on november 2 1769 on the schooner nuestra sexc3xb1ora de guadalupe abandoning their churches rectories and ranches{13]:102xe2x80x93103the arrival of governor don mariano tobias on september 15 1771 brought agricultural reforms including making land available to the islanders for cultivation encouraged the development of cattle raising imported deer and water buffalo from manila donkeys and mules from acapulco established cotton mills and salt pans free public schools and the first guam militia{13]:107xe2x80x93109 later he was transferred to manila in june 1774{13]:113post-napoleonic era{edit]following the napoleonic wars many spanish colonies in the western hemisphere had become independent shifting the economic dependence of guam from mexico to the philippines{13]:144 don francisco ramon de villalobos who became governor in 1831 improved economic conditions including the promotion of rice cultivation and the establishment of a leper hospital{13]:148xe2x80x93149otto von kotzebue visited the island in november 1817{13]:127 and louis de freycinet in march 1819{13]:134 jules dumont d'urville made two visits the first in may 1828{13]:139 the island became a rest stop for whalers starting in 1823{13]:145a devastating typhoon struck the island on august 10 1848 followed by a severe earthquake on january 25 1849 which resulted in many refugees from the caroline islands victims of the resultant tsunami{13]:151 after a smallpox epidemic killed 3644 guamanians in 1856 carolinians and japanese were permitted to settle in the marianas{13]:157 guam received nineteen filipino prisoners after their failed 1872 cavite mutiny{13]:160spanishxe2x80x93american war and world war ii{edit]us marines laying machine gun fire on a japanese sniper nest during the liberation battle on guam (july 28 1944)after almost four centuries as part of the kingdom of spain and its 400 year old globe-girdling spanish empire the united states occupied the island following spain's defeat in the 1898 spanishxe2x80x93american war as part of the treaty of paris of 1898 guam was transferred to the united states navy control on december 23 1898 by executive order 108-a from 25th president william mckinley guam came to serve as a station for american merchant and warships traveling to and from the philippines (another american acquisition from spain) while the northern mariana islands were sold by spain to germany for part of its rapidly expanding german empire then following the german defeat in world war i (1914-1918) became a league of nations mandate in 1919 with the nearby empire of japan as the mandatory ("trustee") as a member nation of the victorious allies in the "great war"{5] a us navy yard was established at piti in 1899 and a united states marine corps barracks at sumay in 1901{15]:13 following the philippinexe2x80x93american war (also known as the philippine insurrection 1899-1902) rebel nationalist leaders emilio aguinaldo and apolinario mabini were exiled on guam in 1901 after their capture{16]:via marine seaplane unit was stationed in guam from 1921 to 1930 the first in the pacific{15]:13 pan american world airways established a seaplane base on the island for its trans-pacific san francisco-manila-hong kong route and the commercial pacific cable company had earlier built a telegraphtelephone station in 1903 for its trans-oceanic communication line{15]:15 during world war ii (1939-1945) guam was attacked and invaded by japan on monday december 8 1941 shortly after the attack on pearl harbor's american pacific fleet and navalair bases in hawaii hours before in addition japan made major military moves into southeast asia and the east indies islands of the south pacific ocean against the british and dutch colonies opening a new wider pacific phase in the second world warbattle of guam july 1944the northern mariana islands had become a league of nations mandate assigned to japan in 1919 pursuant to the treaty of versailles of 1919 it was the chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guam's chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them whereas having been administered by japan for over 30 years the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to the japanese governmentthe japanese occupation of guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months during this period the indigenous people of guam were subjected to forced labor family separation incarceration execution concentration camps and forced prostitution approximately one thousand people died during the occupation according to later congressional committee testimony in 2004 some historians estimate that war violence killed 10 of guam's then 20000 population{17]the united states returned and fought the battle of guam from july 21 to august 10 1944 to recapture the island from japanese military occupation more than 18000 japanese were killed as only 485 surrendered sergeant shoichi yokoi who surrendered in january 1972 appears to have been the last confirmed japanese holdout for 28 years in the forested back country on guam{18] the united states also captured and occupied the nearby northern marianas islandsnorth field was established in 1944 and was renamed for

and granted the people us citizenship the governor of guam was federally appointed until 1968 when the guam elective governor act provided for the office's popular election{19]:242 since guam is not a us state us citizens residing on guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a non-voting member{5] they do however get to vote for party delegates in presidential primaries{20]vietnam war and later{edit]see also: operation arc light and operation rolling thunderandersen air force base played a major role in the vietnam war the host unit was later

crashed into a hill killing 228 of the 254 people on board since 1974 about 124 historic sites in guam have been recognized under the us national register of historic places guam temporarily hosted 100000 vietnamese refugees in 1975 and 6600 kurdish refugees in 1996{15]:17in august 2017 north korea warned that it might launch mid-range ballistic missiles into waters within 18 to 24 miles of guam

of guamguam lies between 132xc2xb0n and 137xc2xb0n and between 1446xc2xb0e and 1450xc2xb0e and has an area of 212 square miles (549xc2xa0km2) making it the 32nd largest island of the united states it is the southernmost and largest island in the mariana island chain and is also the largest island in micronesia this island chain was created by the colliding pacific and philippine sea tectonic plates guam is the closest land mass to the mariana trench a deep subduction zone that lies beside the island chain to the east challenger deep the deepest surveyed point in the oceans is southwest of guam at 35797 feet (10911 meters) deep the highest point in guam is mount lamlam at an elevation of 1334 feet (407 meters){24]the island of guam is 30 miles (50xc2xa0km) long and 4 to 12 miles (6 to 19xc2xa0km) wide three-fourths the size of singapore the island experiences occasional earthquakes due to its location on the western edge of the pacific plate and near the philippine sea plate in recent years earthquakes with epicenters near guam have had magnitudes ranging from 50 to 87 unlike the anatahan volcano in the northern mariana islands guam is not volcanically active however due to its proximity to anatahan vog (ie volcanic smog) does occasionally affect guam{25]a coral table reef surrounds most of guam and the limestone plateau provides the source for most of the island's fresh water steep coastal cliffs dominate the north while the southern end of the island is mountainous with lower hills in between{1]climate{edit]guam experiences a tropical rainforest climate (kxc3xb6ppen af) xe2x80x93 though its driest month of march almost averages dry enough to qualify as a tropical monsoon climate xe2x80x93 moderated by seasonal easterly trade winds the weather is generally very warm with little seasonal temperature variation the mean high temperature is 86xc2xa0xc2xb0f or 30xc2xa0xc2xb0c and mean low is 76xc2xa0xc2xb0f (244xc2xa0xc2xb0c) with an average annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 of around 98 inches or 2490 millimetres temperatures rarely exceed 90xc2xa0xc2xb0f (322xc2xa0xc2xb0c) or fall below 70xc2xa0xc2xb0f (211xc2xa0xc2xb0c) the relative humidity commonly exceeds 84 percent at night throughout the year but the average monthly humidity hovers near 66 percent the dry season runs from december to june the remaining months (july to november) constitute the wet season the months of january and february are considered the coolest months of the year with overnight low temperatures of 70 to 75xc2xa0xc2xb0f (211 to 239xc2xa0xc2xb0c) and generally less oppressive humidity levels the highest temperature ever recorded in guam was 96xc2xa0xc2xb0f (356xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on april 18 1971 and april 1 1990 and the lowest temperature ever recorded was 65xc2xa0xc2xb0f (183xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on february 8 1973{26]guam is located in typhoon alley{27] and it is common for the island to be threatened by tropical storms and possible typhoons during the wet season the highest risk of typhoons is during august through october they can however occur year-round the most intense typhoon to pass over guam recently was super typhoon pongsona with sustained winds of 144 miles per hour (232xc2xa0kmh) gusts to 173 miles per hour (278xc2xa0kmh) which slammed guam on december 8 2002 leaving massive destruction the wettest month on recruit at guam airport has been august 1997 with 3849 inches (9776xc2xa0mm) and the driest february 2015 with 015 inches (38xc2xa0mm) the wettest calendar year has been 1976 with 13170 inches (33452xc2xa0mm) and the driest 1998 with 5788 inches (14702xc2xa0mm) the most rainfall in a single day occurred on 15 october 1953 when 1548 inches or 3932 millimetres fellsince super typhoon pamela in 1976 wooden structures have been largely replaced by concrete structures{28]{29] during the 1980s wooden utility poles began to be replaced by typhoon-resistant concrete and steel poles after the local government

guam and other territories of the spanish east indies most notably the philippinesdue to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance language and canoe building may have been likepuntan dos amantes ("two lovers point") a national natural landmark{33] well known for its romantic associationstwo aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek chenchule' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society it is rooted in the core value of inafa'maolek historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote "in a chamorro sense the land and its produce belong to everyone inafa'maolek or interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro culturexc2xa0 inafa'maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves around it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights"the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect: from sniffing over the hands of the elders (called mangnginge in chamorro) the passing down of legends chants and courtship rituals to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide' canoe-making making of the belembaotuyan (a string musical instrument made from a gourd) fashioning of xc3xa5cho'

shell necklaces bracelets earrings belts and combs made from tortoise shells and spondylus)the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the us mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity{citation needed] while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro peoplesports{edit]pacific games{edit]guam hosted the pacific games in 1975 and 1999 at

association between the united states the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands and the republic of palau accorded the former entities of the trust territory of the pacific islands a political status of "free association" with the united states the compacts give citizens of these island nations generally no restrictions to reside in the united states (also its territories) and many were attracted to guam due to its proximity environmental and cultural familiarity over the years it was claimed by some in guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration{citation needed] over the years congress had appropriated "compact impact" aids to guam the northern mariana islands and hawaii and eventually this appropriation was written into each renewed compact some however continue to claim the compensation is not enough or that the distribution of actual compensation received is significantly disproportionate{citation needed]as of

privilege to speak to the house us citizens in guam vote in a straw poll for their choice in the us presidential general election but since guam has no votes in the electoral college the poll has no real effect however in sending delegates to the republican and democratic national conventions guam does have influence in the national presidential race these delegates are elected by local party conventions{5]political status{edit]in the 1980s and early 1990s there was a significant movement in favor of this us territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause (art iv sec 3 cl 2) of the us constitution other movements advocate us statehood for guam union with the state of hawaii or union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory or independence{42]in a 1982 plebiscite voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status{citation needed] the island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998 governor eddie baza calvo intended to include one during the island's november 2016 elections but it was delayed again{43]eddie baza calvo governor of guama commission on decolonization was established in 1997 to educate the people of guam about the various political status options in its relationship with the us: statehood free association and independence the group was dormant for some years in 2013 the commission began seeking funding to start a public education campaign there were few subsequent developments until late 2016 in early december 2016 the commission scheduled a series of education sessions in various villages about the current status of guam's relationship with the us and the self-determination options that might be considered{43] the commission's current executive director is edward alvarez and there are ten members the group is also expected to release position papers on independence and statehood but the contents have not yet been completed{44]the united nations is in favor of greater self-determination for guam and other such territories the un's special committee on decolonization has agreed to endorse the governor's education plan the commission's may 2016 report states: "with academics from the university of guam {the commission] was working to create and approve educational materials the office of the governor was collaborating closely with the commission" in developing educational materials for the public{45]the united states department of the interior had approved a 300000 grant for decolonization education edward alvarez told the united nations pacific regional seminar in may 2016 "we are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in {united states] policy to its non-self-governing territories

guam is currently viewed as a key military hub that will further allow us military power to be projected via sea and skythe us military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8600 marines and 9000 of their dependents to guam from okinawa japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase guam's population by 45 in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs{48] by 2012 these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents{49]with the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of us marines from okinawa japan to guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40 of the entire landmass of guamin january 2011 the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fy2011 indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning us marine corps service members and their families from okinawa to guam the transfer may be as late as 2020 in addition the defense authorization act cut approximately 320 million from the 2011 budget requestvillagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways many villagers serve in the military or are retired many active duty personnel and defense department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas the military and village communities have "adoption" programs where guam's population and military personnel stationed on guam perform community service projectstransportation and communications{edit]main articles: communications in guam and transportation in guamguam

and regular us postage stamps have been used ever since because guam is also part of the us postal system (postal abbreviation: gu zip code range: 96910xe2x80x9396932) mail to guam from the us mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required private shipping companies such as fedex ups and dhl however have no obligation to do so and do not regard guam as domesticthe speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two fourth-class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to "guam" instead of "usa" to avoid being routed the long way through the us mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from asia)the commercial port of guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line matson inc whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500000 customers throughout the micronesian region the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island's us department of defense installations andersen air force base and commander naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary forceguam is served by the antonio b won pat international airport which is a hub for united airlines the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction therefore the us customs and border protection only carries immigration (but not customs) functions since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantinehowever due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands no immigration check is performed traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point however does require a passportmost residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles the local government currently outsources the only public bus system (guam regional transit authority) and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locationsecology{edit]brown tree snake{edit]brown tree snakebelieved to be a stowaway on a us military transport near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake (boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands{51]{52]before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail (or ko'ko' bird in chamorro) and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction{53] according to many elders ko'ko' birds were common in guam before world war ii{54]other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rota{53]guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsong{55]{56]{1] {2] forest on guam swathed in spider webscoconut rhinoceros beetle{edit]coconut rhinoceros beetlean infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (crb) oryctes

the infestation was limited to tumon bay and faifai beach an area of approximately 900 acres (36xc2xa0km2) guam department of agriculture (gda) placed quarantine on all properties within the tumon area on october 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about 2500 acres (10xc2xa0km2) on october 25; approximately 05 miles (800xc2xa0m) radius in all directions from all known locations of crb infestation crb is native to southern asia and distributed throughout asia and the western pacific including sri lanka upolu samoa american samoa palau new britain west irian new ireland pak island

spanish introduced pigs dogs chickens the philippine deer (rusa mariannus) black francolins and carabao (a subspecies of water buffalo) which have cultural significance herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the us military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents{57]other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937 the giant african snail (an agricultural pest introduced during world warxc2xa0ii by japanese occupation troops) and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coquxc3xad that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten guam's tourism{58]guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax (native to the eastern coast of australia) has been present in guam since 1968 and rhinella marina (the cane toad) was brought to the island in 1937 the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri (native to mainland asia) microhyla pulchra (native to mainland asia) polypedates braueri (endemic to taiwan) eleutherodactylus planirostris (native to the caribbean) fejervarya cancrivora (the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan) and fejervarya limnocharis (native to southeast asia) have been in guam since 2003{59] many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asiaintroduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guam's native plants and animalsthreats to indigenous plants{edit]invading animal species are not the only threat to guam's native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of guam's economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of guam{60]during the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan brush (leucaena leucocephala) much of guam's foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947 the us military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905{61]in southern guam non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree (delonix regia) is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimatedwildfires{edit]guam's grasslandwildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the island's humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80 resulting from arson{62] poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and "barrens" have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (planting trees) have had little success in preserving natural habitats{63]aquatic preserves{edit]having previously experienced extensive dredging tumon bay is now a marine wildlife preserveefforts have been made to protect guam's coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations (since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important) in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists{64] before adopting us environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests{65]{66] tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats{67]harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle (chelonia mydas) was harvested legally on guam before august 1978 when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the hawksbill sea turtle (eretmochelys imbricata) has been on the endangered list since 1970 in an
