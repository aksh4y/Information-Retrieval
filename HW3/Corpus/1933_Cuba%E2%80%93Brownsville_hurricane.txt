this suggested winds of about 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) the hurricane turned more to the west on septemberxc2xa03 and as it approached southern texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated at 0400xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa05 the hurricane made its final landfall on south padre island in southern texas with winds estimated at 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) it quickly weakened over land as it crossed into northeastern mexico and the storm dissipated late on septemberxc2xa05{1]impact{edit]rainfall totals in south texasthroughout its path the hurricane killed at least 179xc2xa0people collectively in the turks and caicos islands cuba and south texas{2] it first affected the turks and caicos producing winds of 54xc2xa0mph (87xc2xa0kmh) on grand turk{3]before the hurricane struck cuba officials warned of the impending storm and military workers warned people to remain indoors{4] about 4000xc2xa0people evacuated the coastal town of isabela on three trains specifically run for the residents in havana business owners secured their properties in anticipation of the storm{5] most of the deaths from the hurricane occurred in northern cuba winds of over 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) affected the coastline and havana reported maximum winds of 94xc2xa0mph (151xc2xa0kmh){1] there the winds downed power lines and uprooted trees high waves flooded six blocks of the city with up to 4xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) of water entering the cellars of some homes{4] east of havana in cxc3xa1rdenas high waves destroyed the aqueduct while high winds severely damaged the local sugar industry a nearby coastal town 20xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) east of cxc3xa1rdenas was described as being "virtually leveled by the storm" in news reports{6] in cienfuegos along the southern coast the hurricane destroyed many ships and piers{4] high waves washed four ships ashore one of which damaged another ship{7] high winds destroyed hundreds of houses and damaged many others along the storm's path{8] about 100000xc2xa0people were left homeless many of whom lacking food or medical supplies{9] in the interior of the country the hurricane dropped rainfall that flooded rivers and towns{10] damage was estimated at 11xc2xa0million and a report published in 2003 indicated that there were about 70xc2xa0deaths in the country;{11] however newspaper accounts from shortly after the hurricane indicated there were around 100xc2xa0deaths{12] after the storm police officers were deployed to maintain order{4] officers shot and killed five people caught looting in havana although the deaths were not included in the overall death toll{13] officials deployed trucks to pick up wounded citizens{14]while the hurricane was over the bahamas late on augustxc2xa030 the united states weather bureau issued storm warnings for southern florida two days later the storm struck cuba and passed south of the state producing peak winds of 42xc2xa0mph (68xc2xa0kmh) in key west{3] the winds caused little damage; however high waves destroyed a sea wall and washed onto a coastal roadway high waves also sank a boat killing three people{15]three days before the hurricane made its final landfall officials at the weather bureau in brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the texas coast declaring that it was "uncertain where tropical storm in gulf will reach coast line but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on texas coast over week end" the early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the texas beaches on labor day weekend as a result an official at the corpus christi weather bureau office estimated that the warning "probably saved thousands of lives" early on septemberxc2xa04 about a day before landfall the weather bureau issued a hurricane warning from corpus christi to freeport and storm warnings for other locations along the texas coast when the storm's westward motion became more apparent the hurricane warning was dropped north of corpus christi and extended southward to brownsville{3] officials in corpus christi declared martial law before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas shelters opened in the city and many businesses closed{16]when the storm moved across the area winds were estimated at 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) in brownsville{3] with gusts to 125xc2xa0mph (201xc2xa0kmh){17] high tides were reported along the coast{15] and the storm surge reached 13xc2xa0ft (40xc2xa0m) near brownsville the tides flooded portions of corpus christi about 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) deep sinking boats and damaging piers storm-generated waves destroyed 20xc2xa0buildings in one settlement the storm destroyed the causeway from padre island to flour bluff and there were over 40xc2xa0breaches in the island{17] some up to a mile wide{16] the storm dropped heavy rainfall from southern texas through northeastern mexico{18] peaking at over 150xc2xa0in (380xc2xa0mm) at a station near mercedes; the total was one of four 24xe2x80x91hour precipitation records set by the storm{17] the rains from the storm and two previous hurricanes led to a large increase in tropical butterfly species across the area{18] throughout the rio grande valley the strong winds destroyed about 90 of the citrus crop{17] overall the hurricane left 169xc2xa0million in damage and 40xc2xa0deaths mostly in cameron county{15]{17] however none of the deaths were in brownsville or corpus christi which was credited to the advance warning{3] damage was less than expected in corpus christi and many business owners who lost revenue sent letters of outcry to the weather bureau headquarters; however the bureau determined that the evacuations and warnings were warranted given the storm's threat{16]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of texas hurricanes (1900xe2x80x9349)list of category 5 atlantic hurricanesnotes{edit]^ all damage totals are in 1933 united states dollars unless otherwise notedreferences{edit]^ a b c d chris landsea;
