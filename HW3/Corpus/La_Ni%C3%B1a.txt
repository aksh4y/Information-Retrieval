b'la nixc3xb1a - wikipedia la nixc3xb1afrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchfor the ship see nixc3xb1asea surface skin temperature anomalies in november 2007 showing la nixc3xb1a conditionsla nixc3xb1a (lxc9x91xcbx90xcbx88nixcbx90njxc9x99 spanish pronunciation:xc2xa0{la xcbx88nixc9xb2a]) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of el nixc3xb1o as part of the broader el nixc3xb1oxe2x80x93southern oscillation climate pattern the name la nixc3xb1a originates from spanish meaning "the little girl" analogous to el nixc3xb1o meaning "the little boy" it has also in the past been called anti-el nixc3xb1o{1] and el viejo (meaning "the old man"){2] during a period of la nixc3xb1a the sea surface temperature across the equatorial eastern central pacific ocean will be lower than normal by 3 to 5xc2xa0xc2xb0c in the united states an appearance of la nixc3xb1a persists for at least five months it has extensive effects on the weather in north america even affecting the atlantic and pacific hurricane seasonscontents1 definition2 occurrences3 impacts on the global climate4 regional impacts41 africa42 asia43 north america44 south america5 diversity6 see also7 references8 external linksdefinition{edit]la nixc3xb1a is the positive phase of the el nixc3xb1o southern oscillation and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean{3] however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la nixc3xb1a event which is tailored to their specific interests{4] for example the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nixc3xb1o 3 and 34 regions before declaring that a la nixc3xb1a event has started{5] however the japan meteorological agency declares that a la nixc3xb1a event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino3 region is more than 05xc2xa0xc2xb0c (090xc2xa0xc2xb0f) cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer{6]occurrences{edit]a timeline of all la nixc3xb1a episodes between 1900 and 2017{7]{8]there was a relatively strong la nixc3xb1a episode during 1988xe2x80x931989 la nixc3xb1a also formed in late 1983{9] in 1995 and a protracted la nixc3xb1a event that lasted from mid-1998 through early 2001 this was followed by a neutral period between 2001 and 2002 the la nixc3xb1a which developed in mid-2007 and lasted until almost 2009 was a moderate one the strength of la nixc3xb1a made the 2008 atlantic hurricane season one of the five most active since 1944; sixteen named storms had winds of at least 39 miles per hour (63xc2xa0kmh) eight of which became 74-mile-per-hour (119xc2xa0kmh) or greater hurricanes{10]a new la nixc3xb1a episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical pacific in mid-2010{11] and lasted until early 2011{12] it intensified again in mid-2011 and lasted until early 2012{13] this la nixc3xb1a combined with record-high ocean temperatures in the north-eastern indian ocean was a large factor in the 2010xe2x80x932011 queensland floods{14] and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in north america starting with the december 2010 north american blizzard the same la nixc3xb1a event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average severity that struck the midwestern and southern united states in the spring of 2011 and drought conditions in the south central states including texas oklahoma and arkansas{15] meanwhile a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in california in december 2010 with seven consecutive days of non-stop rainfall leading to one of the wettest decembers in over 120 years of records this is in contrast to the drier-than-normal conditions typically associated with la nixc3xb1a in california{16]in 2011 on a global scale la nixc3xb1a events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends as a result 2011 tied with 1997 for the eleventh-warmest year on record it was the second-coolest year of the 21st century to date and tied with the second-warmest year of the 20th century a relatively strong phase of la nixc3xb1a opened the year dissipated in the spring before re-emerging in october and lasted through the end of the year when compared to previous la nixc3xb1a years the 2011 global surface temperature was the warmest observed the 2011 globally-averaged precipitation over land was the second-wettest year on record behind 2010 precipitation varied greatly across the globe this la nixc3xb1a contributed to severe drought in east africa and to australia's third-wettest year in its 112-year period of records{17]la nixc3xb1as occurred in 1904 1908 1910 1916 1924 1928 1938 1949xe2x80x9351{18] 1954xe2x80x9356 1964 1970xe2x80x9372 1973xe2x80x9376 1983xe2x80x9385{9] 1988xe2x80x9389 1995xe2x80x9396 1998xe2x80x932001 2007xe2x80x9308 2010xe2x80x9312 and 2016xe2x80x9317{11]{19]{20]impacts on the global climate{edit]la nixc3xb1a impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others{21]regional impacts{edit]observations of la nixc3xb1a events since 1950 show that impacts associated with la nixc3xb1a events depend on what season it is{22] however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur{22]africa{edit]between 50000 and 100000 people died during the 2011 horn of africa drought{23]la nixc3xb1a results in wetter-than-normal conditions in southern africa from december to february and drier-than-normal conditions over equatorial east africa over the same period{24]asia{edit]during la nixc3xb1a years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china{25] in march 2008 la nixc3xb1a caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia by 2xc2xa0xc2xb0c it also caused heavy rains over malaysia the philippines and indonesia{26]north america{edit]regional impacts of la nixc3xb1ala nixc3xb1a causes mostly the opposite effects of el nixc3xb1o above-average precipitation across the northern midwest the northern rockies northern california and the pacific northwest's southern and eastern regions meanwhile precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states is below average{27] this also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the atlantic and fewer in the pacificthe synoptic condition for tehuantepecer winds is associated with high-pressure system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores-bermuda high pressure system wind magnitude is weaker during la nixc3xb1a years than el nixc3xb1o years due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during la nixc3xb1a winters{28] with its effects can last from a few hours to six days{29]in canada la nixc3xb1a will in general cause a cooler snowier winter such as the near-record-breaking amounts of snow recorded in la nixc3xb1a winter of 20072008 in eastern canada{30]{31]south america{edit]during a time of la nixc3xb1a drought plagues the coastal regions of peru and chile{32] from december to february northern brazil is wetter than normal{32] la nixc3xb1a causes higher than normal rainfall in the central andes which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the llanos de mojos of beni department bolivia such flooding is documented from 1853 1865 1872 1873 1886 1895 1896 1907 1921 1928 1929 and 1931{33]diversity{edit]map showing nixc3xb1o34 and other index regionsthe traditional la nixc3xb1a also called eastern pacific (ep) la nixc3xb1a{34] involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional la nixc3xb1a were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly (nixc3xb1o 1 and 2) is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific (nixc3xb1o 34){35] the phenomenon is called central pacific (cp) la nixc3xb1a{34] "dateline" la nixc3xb1a (because the anomaly arises near the dateline) or la nixc3xb1a "modoki" (modoki is japanese for "similar but different"){36]{37] there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid types{38]the effects of the cp la nixc3xb1a are different from those of the traditional ep la nixc3xb1axe2x80x94eg the recently discovered la nixc3xb1a leads to a rainfall increase over northwestern australia and northern murray-darling basin rather than over the east as in a conventional la nixc3xb1a{37] also la nixc3xb1a modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over bay of bengal but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the indian ocean overall with the arabian sea becoming severely non-conductive to tropical cyclone formation{39]{40]the recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming{41] however comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979 generally there is no scientific consensus on howif climate change may affect enso{42]there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this "new" enso a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction{43]{44] finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches{45]{46]{47]{48]{49] or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso{50]{51]recent years when la nixc3xb1a modoki events occurred include 1973xe2x80x9374 1975xe2x80x9376 1983xe2x80x9384 1988xe2x80x9389 1998xe2x80x9399
