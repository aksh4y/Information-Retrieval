but even then the falling precipitation must generally be something other than exclusively snowin the united states wintry mix generally refers to a mixture of freezing rain ice pellets and snow{6] in contrast to the usage in the united kingdom in the united states it is usually used when air and ground temperatures are below 0xc2xa0xc2xb0c (32xc2xa0xc2xb0f) additionally it is generally used when some accumulation of ice and snow is expected to occur during winter a wide area can be affected by the multiple precipitation types typical of a wintry mix during a single winter storm as counter-clockwise winds around a storm system bring warm air northwards ahead of the system and then bring cold air back southwards behind it most often it is the region ahead of the approaching storm system which sees the wintry mix as warm air moves northward and above retreating cold air causing snow to change to ice pellets freezing rain and finally rain the reverse transition can occur behind the departing low pressure system though it is more common for precipitation to change directly from rain to snow or for it to stop before a transition backsee also{edit]freezing rainice pelletssleet (disambiguation)winter weatherreferences{edit]^   "weather glossary" environment canada retrieved 2015-03-30 ice pellets: this is the term canadians use to describe frozen rain drops which are five millimetres or less in diameter and bounce when they hit a hard surface americans call this sleetxc2xa0^    links{edit]ams glossary retrieved from ""categories: precipitationsnow or ice weather phenomena navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagesxd8xa7xd9x84xd8xb9xd8xb1xd8xa8xd9x8axd8xa9catalxc3xa0corsucymraegdeutscheestixcex95xcexbbxcexbbxcexb7xcexbdxcexb9xcexbaxcexacespaxc3xb1olesperantoeuskaraxd9x81xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cfranxc3xa7aisgaeilgegxc3xa0idhligxedx95x9cxeaxb5xadxecx96xb4italianoxd7xa2xd7x91xd7xa8xd7x99xd7xaalietuvixc5xb3bahasa melayuxe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9enorsk nynorskportuguxc3xaasslovenxc5xa1xc4x8dinaxd0xa1xd1x80xd0xbfxd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8  srpskisuomisvenskatxc3xbcrkxc3xa7exe6x96x87xe8xa8x80xe7xb2xb5xe8xaax9exc5xbdemaitxc4x97xc5xa1kaxe4xb8xadxe6x96x87 edit links  this page was last edited on 11 october 2017 at 22:09text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
