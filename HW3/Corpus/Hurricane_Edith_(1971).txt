carolinapart of the 1971 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 atlantic hurricane season and the southernmost landfalling category 5 hurricane on record in the atlantic until surpassed by hurricane felix of 2007 edith developed from a tropical wave on september 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the caribbean sea edith rapidly intensified on september 9 and made landfall on cape gracias a dios as a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale it quickly lost intensity over central america and after briefly entering the gulf of honduras it crossed the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula in mexico after moving across the gulf of mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and edith after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast made landfall on louisiana with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh) on september 16 edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over georgia on september 18the hurricane killed two people when it passed near aruba striking northeastern central america as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35xc2xa0people in texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm one tornado rated f3 on the fujita scale damaged several homes and injured multiple people in baton rouge the tornado outbreak extended eastward into florida of which a few destroyed entire buildings damage in the united states totaled us25xc2xa0million (1971 dollars 148xc2xa0million in 2016 dollars)contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 caribbean32 united states4 see also5 references6 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the coast of africa near dakar on august 31 it moved westward into the intertropical convergence zone and organized into a tropical disturbance on september 2 with a small circular area of convection the system moved to the west and on september 3 the convection diminished after moving west of 40xc2xb0 w{1] by the next day the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the intertropical convergence zone{2] the wave gradually became detached from the itcz and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on september 5 while located 255xc2xa0miles (415xc2xa0km) east of grenada{1]the depression moved westward quickly and moved through the southern lesser antilles early on september 6 the southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern venezuela though after entering the caribbean sea another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm the existence of a low-level circulation{2] shortly thereafter while moving into an area of light wind shear it was able to organize and strengthen further and on september 7 the depression strengthened into tropical storm edith near the island of curaxc3xa7ao while initially a cold-core upper-level low persisted about 750xc2xa0miles (1200xc2xa0km) northwest of the storm edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent ridge of high pressure which extended from the southwestern atlantic ocean to the gulf of mexico as the storm continued into open waters of the caribbean the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone this allowed the storm to strengthen further and on september 8 edith became a hurricane in the south-central caribbean sea{1]on september 9 the storm rapidly intensified and within 24xc2xa0hours edith strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a powerful 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) category 5 hurricane just off the coast of nicaragua the cause for the explosive deepening is unknown though it is speculated that the transformation in the upper troposphere from an upper-level low to an anticyclone led to a release of baroclinic energy reconnaissance aircraft crews in the peak of the storm reported extreme turbulence causing concern for the safety of the crews at its peak intensity the very well-defined "pinhole" eye was only 5xc2xa0miles (8xc2xa0km) in diameter late on september 9 hurricane edith made landfall on northeastern nicaragua at cabo gracias a dios{1]radar image of edith at peak intensityhurricane edith rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of northeastern central america and 18xc2xa0hours after it made landfall it emerged into the gulf of honduras as an 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) category 1 hurricane it continued to weaken as it moved northwestward and made landfall near belize city with tropical storm winds of 70xc2xa0mph (115xc2xa0kmh) edith weakened further while crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and emerged into the gulf of mexico near campeche mexico late on september 11 as a minimal tropical storm edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters{1] this was because an anticyclone over the gulf was closely connected with hurricane fern which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the gulf of mexico the anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across edith creating conditions not conducive for intensification{3] as fern moved inland over texas the flow became more favorable around edith and 36xc2xa0hours after entering the gulf of mexico the storm began to reintensify slightly{1]edith continued moving to the west-northwest heading towards the coast of mexico but early on september 14 the storm stalled while located just off the coast of tamaulipas a mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm and caused edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast located only miles from the mexican coast edith again failed to strengthen until september 15 when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status the hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of louisiana and made landfall on september 16 in a sparsely populated area 30xc2xa0miles (48xc2xa0km) east of cameron with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh) equivalent to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane in the saffir-simpson hurricane scale edith rapidly weakened over land degenerating into a tropical storm over louisiana and into a tropical depression over mississippi it continued to the east-northeast and dissipated over northwestern georgia on september 18{1]preparations{edit]fourteen hours prior to edith making landfall in central america the national hurricane center warned citizens about the extreme danger of the approaching hurricane and asked them to prepare for hurricane conditions while the storm was located in the gulf of mexico the national hurricane center issued a hurricane warning from cameron to morgan city louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area{4]in belize officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas resulting in hundreds of residents leaving to the united states through the international airport officials sent police troops to maintain order and prevent looting{5]in the gulf of mexico several oil facilities were closed or placed on automatic controls drilling rigs as far east as the coastal waters off of mississippi were prepared to evacuate in the event edith moved further east than anticipated additionally thousands evacuated coastal areas of louisiana prior to the arrival of the hurricane several shelters opened in coastal cities and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies officials closed schools throughout much of southern louisiana{6]impact{edit]caribbean{edit]edith entering the gulf of honduraswhile passing through the southern lesser antilles the tropical depression produced heavy rainfall and winds of around 35xc2xa0mph (55xc2xa0kmh){2] edith produced tropical storm force winds in aruba and gusts reached 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) two fishermen were reported lost at sea and presumed dead as a result of edith{1]edith produced strong winds across northeastern nicaragua and eastern honduras with puerto lempira reporting an unofficial sustained wind of 140xc2xa0mph (225xc2xa0kmh) press reports indicated every house in the cape gracias area was destroyed or heavily damaged leaving 7000 homeless the meteorological service in british honduras stated there were 100 fatalities near cape gracias{7] though a later report indicated 35xc2xa0people died in nicaragua there damage was estimated at over us380000 (1971 dollars 225xc2xa0million in 2016 dollars){8] three united states air force aircraft delivered food medical supplies and fuel to the hurricane victims of nicaragua{9] in honduras the hurricane produced 15xc2xa0foot (45xc2xa0m) tides and strong winds while strong waves destroyed 40xc2xa0fishing boats as well{10] while the hurricane reportedly destroyed entire villages{11] no deaths occurred in honduras{1]offshore islands in belize reported winds of up to 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh){1] edith produced flooding in a few towns in the southern portion of the country with some buildings damaged heavy damage was reported near monkey river town{5] impact in mexico if any is unknownunited states{edit]rainfall from edithtwo stations in texas recorded sustained tropical force winds and galveston reported a peak wind gust of 53xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) while moving past the state edith produced above normal tides of over 4xc2xa0feet (12xc2xa0m) in locations{1] which flooded a portion of highway 87{12] the storm dropped light to moderate amounts of rainfall peaking at 35xc2xa0inches (89xc2xa0mm) in sabine pass{1] the passage of hurricane edith resulted in downed trees and power lines and damage totaling us180000 (1971 dollars 900000 in 2006 dollars){12]off the coast of louisiana the hurricane wrecked three boats but all the occupants were safely rescued{11] while making landfall in louisiana edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 97xc2xa0feet (29xc2xa0m) above normal at cypremont point near morgan city{1] the highest winds reported by a land station were 69xc2xa0mph (111xc2xa0kmh) at cameron where a wind gust of 96xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh) was also reported however due to the lack of recording instruments near the hurricane's landing point whether higher winds occurred there is not known although likely{7] rainfall was moderate across louisiana including amounts of over 8xc2xa0inches (200xc2xa0mm) in the southwestern portion of the state{1] a strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane{1] combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane's circulation produced 16 tornadoes from louisiana to alabama{13] an f3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of baton rouge causing heavy property damage totaling 25xc2xa0million (1971 dollars 148xc2xa0million in 2016 dollars) along its intermittent 7xc2xa0mile (11xc2xa0km) path the tornado also injured three people{1]{14] an f2 tornado in tangipahoa parish caused 250000 in damage (1971 dollars 148xc2xa0million in 2016 dollars) along its 4xc2xa0mile (6xc2xa0km) path{15] while an f1 tornado in st martin parish injured 6xc2xa0people on its 3xc2xa0mile (5xc2xa0km) path{16] the hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern louisiana{7] about a month after edith struck the united states president richard nixon declared portions of louisiana as a disaster area which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens{17]in mississippi wind gusts peaked at 70xc2xa0mph (112xc2xa0kmh) in hattiesburg with multiple locations reporting tropical-storm-force winds additionally edith produced moderate rainfall peaking at 615xc2xa0inches (156xc2xa0mm) in liberty in alabama the storm caused light rains moderate wind gusts and a storm tide of 27xc2xa0feet (08xc2xa0m) in mobile{1] edith spawned four tornadoes in alabama three of which were f2 tornadoes two touched down in baldwin county; one destroyed two homes and damaged several others and the other destroyed two mobile homes a few barns and damaged ten houses two tornadoes also touched down in washington county one of which destroyed several small buildings and downed a few trees{18] in florida edith produced slightly above-normal tides and light rain it spawned a tornado in pensacola florida{1] injuring one person and inflicting 25000 in damage (1971 dollars 125000 in 2006 dollars){19] damage throughout the united states totaled 25xc2xa0million (1971 dollars 148xc2xa0million in 2016 dollars) primarily from crop damage in southwest louisiana no deaths were reported in the united states{1]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms of the same namelist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneshurricane felixreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i
