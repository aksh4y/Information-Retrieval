message)density lines and isobars cross in a baroclinic fluid (top) as density is related to temperature on a surface map isobars and isotherms cross tooin fluid dynamics the baroclinity (often called baroclinicity) of a stratified fluid is a measure of how misaligned the gradient of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid{1]{2] in meteorology a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure; contrast this with a barotropic atmosphere for which the density depends only on the pressure in atmospheric terms the barotropic zones of the earth are generally found in the central latitudes or tropics whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-latitudepolar regionsbaroclinity is proportional toxe2x88x87pxc3x97xe2x88x87xcfx81{displaystyle abla pimes abla rho }which is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant pressure and surfaces of constant density thus in a barotropic fluid (which is defined by zero baroclinity) these surfaces are parallelareas of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of cyclonesbaroclinic instability{edit]baroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the atmosphere and in the oceans in the atmosphere it is the dominant mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that dominate weather in mid-latitudes in the ocean it generates a field of mesoscale (100xc2xa0km or smaller) eddies that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers baroclinic instability is a concept relevant to rapidly rotating strongly stratified fluidswhether a fluid counts as rapidly rotating is determined in this context by the rossby number which is a measure of how close the flow is to solid body rotation more precisely a flow in solid body rotation has vorticity that is proportional to its angular velocity the rossby number is a measure of the departure of the vorticity from that of solid body rotation the rossby number must be small for the concept of baroclinic instability to be relevant when the rossby number is large other kinds of instabilities often referred to as inertial become more relevantthe simplest example of a stably stratified flow is an incompressible flow with density decreasing with height in a compressible gas such as the atmosphere the relevant measure is the vertical gradient of the entropy which must increase with height for the flow to be stably stratified one measures the strength of the stratification by asking how large the vertical shear of the horizontal winds has to be in order to destabilize the flow and produce the classic kelvinxe2x80x93helmholtz instability this measure is the richardson number when the richardson number is large the stratification is strong enough to prevent this shear instabilitybefore the classic work of jule charney and eric eady on baroclinic instability in the late 1940s{3]{4] most theories trying to explain the structure of mid-latitude eddies took as their starting points the high rossby number or small richardson number instabilities familiar to fluid dynamicists at that time the most important feature of baroclinic instability is that it exists even in the situation of rapid rotation (small rossby number) and strong stable stratification (large richardson's number) typically observed in the atmospherethe energy source for baroclinic instability is the potential energy in the environmental flow as the instability grows the center of mass of the fluid is lowered in growing waves in the atmosphere cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer air moving polewards and upwardsbaroclinic instability can be investigated in the laboratory using a rotating fluid filled annulus the annulus is heated at the outer wall and cooled at the inner wall and the resulting fluid flows give rise to baroclinically unstable waves{5]{6]the term "baroclinic" refers to the mechanism by which vorticity is generated vorticity is the curl of the velocity field in general the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection (as vortex tubes move with the flow) stretching and twisting (as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow) and baroclinic vorticity generation which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure baroclinic flows can be contrasted with barotropic flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticitythe study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weatherbaroclinic vector{edit]beginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid (the euler equations) and taking the curl one arrives at the equation of motion for the curl of the fluid velocity that is to say the vorticityin a fluid that is not all of the same density a source term appears in the vorticity equation whenever surfaces of constant density (isopycnic surfaces) and surfaces of constant pressure (isobaric surfaces) are not aligned the material derivative of the local vorticity is given

fluids internal gravity waves as well as unstable rayleighxe2x80x93taylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector it is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media such as in the richtmyerxe2x80x93meshkov instabilitydivers may be familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a thermocline or a halocline; these are internal waves similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil when the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out in the process the interface overshoots and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave unlike surface gravity waves internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface for example in bodies of water a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic
