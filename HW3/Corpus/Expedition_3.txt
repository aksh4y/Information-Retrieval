the complex on 13 august 2001 the crew conducted a science-intensive increment and completed four spacewalks the expedition three crew ended their 117-day residency on board the iss on 8 december 2001 when their custom soyuz seat-liners were transferred to space shuttle endeavour for the return trip home during mission sts-108the expedition three crew of the international space station enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 leonid meteor storm "it looked like we were seeing ufos approaching the earth flying in formation three or four at a time" recalls astronaut frank culbertson "there were hundreds per minute going beneath us really spectacular!" news reports had warned sky watchers in advance: on 18 november 2001 earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by comet tempel-tuttle innumerable bits of comet dust would become meteors when they hit earth's atmosphere at 144000 miles per hour (64000xc2xa0ms) experts predicted an unforgettable display  and it came millions of people saw the show but only three of themxe2x80x94the ones on board the space stationxe2x80x94saw it from above "we had to look down to see the meteors" says culbertson "that's because the atmosphere (where comet dust burns up) is below the station"an international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the international space station the team was led by american commander frank culbertson and joined by russian crewmates vladimir dezhurov mission pilot and flight engineer mikhail tyurin as a part of the sts-105 mission discovery delivered the expedition 3 crew to the station during their four-month stay the crew saw the orbital complex expand and research work grow the expedition 3 crew returned home on mission sts-108spacewalks{edit]all four of the spacewalks during expedition 3 were completed using the russian orlan spacesuit and from the pirs air lock on the russian segment of the international space stationmissionspacewalkersstart (utc)end

to the space environment over a long time called mpac-seeds the investigation is housed in three briefcase-sized containers{2]{3]expedition 3eva 3dezhurovfrank culbertson12 november 200121:4113

space walker at the end of the crane's boom to simulate a cargo they also inspected and photographed a small panel of one solar array on the zvezda service module that has one portion of a panel not fully unfolded{2]{3]expedition 3eva 4dezhurovtyurin3 december 200113:203 december 200116:062 hours 46 minutesdezhurov and tyurin removed an obstruction that prevented a progress resupply ship from firmly docking with the international space station they also took pictures of the debris which was a rubber seal from the previous cargo ship and of the docking interface{3]mission patch{edit]the expedition 3 mission patch depicts the book of space history turning from the chapter with the russian space station mir and the space shuttle to the next chapter one that will be written on the blank pages of the future by space explorers working for the benefit of the entire world above the book is a layout of what the station will look like when completed docked with the space shuttle911
