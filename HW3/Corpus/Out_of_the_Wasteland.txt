of the wasteland received positive reviews from music critics allmusic's stephen thomas erlewine rates the album three stars out of five and states "it is an immaculately constructed record easing between insistent midtempo anthems and power ballads" that "indulge in middle-aged introspection"{24] alex lai for contact music describes the album as "ultimately a welcome return for the band who provide a number of genuinely worthy songs to the lifehouse legacy"{25] michael weaver giving the album four stars for jesus freak hideout writes "out of the wasteland is a fine example of everything good about lifehouse and anyone would be well-served to get this album today"{27] rating the album a nine out of ten for cross rhythms philip laing writes "this is overall an impressive return to form by the mainstream stalwarts"{26] pluggedin's adam r holz comments on wade's proclamation of returning to a more innocent place for writing asserting that it "didnxe2x80x99t prevent lifehouse's latest from overflowing with the kind of mature perspective on life and love conflict and perseverance that no 17-year-old could ever articulate"{29] johan wippsson writes for melodicnet that 'firing squad' and 'central park' are "top class where the band feels hungry and 'real' again" concluding that the album "should be considered as one of the greatest in the genre"{28]track listing{edit]all tracks
