greenlandpart of the 2010 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane igor was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record to strike the canadian island of newfoundland and the strongest hurricane of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season igor originated from a broad area of low pressure that moved off the cape verde islands on the west coast of africa on septemberxc2xa06 2010 tracking slowly westward it developed into a tropical depression on septemberxc2xa08 and strengthened into a tropical storm shortly thereafter higher wind shear temporarily halted intensification over the following days on septemberxc2xa012 explosive intensification took place and igor reached categoryxc2xa04 status on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale by this time igor had already begun a prolonged turn around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge peaking with winds of 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) the cyclone began to enter an area unfavorable for continued strengthening and igor gradually weakened before brushing bermuda as a minimal hurricane on septemberxc2xa020 after turning northeastward the system began an extratropical transition which it completed shortly after striking southern newfoundland the remnants of igor were later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over the labrador sea on septemberxc2xa023while the hurricane was over the open ocean it produced large swells that caused the deaths of three peoplexc2xa0xe2x80x94 two in the caribbean and one in the united states as it passed west of bermuda as a minimal hurricane damage was limited primarily to trees and power lines with roughly 27500xc2xa0residences losing electricity total losses in the territory were less than us500000{nb 1] however in newfoundland igor wrought extreme damage claimed to be the worst ever seen in some areas large stretches of roadways were completely washed out by flooding including a portion of the trans-canada highway isolating approximately 150xc2xa0communities throughout the region one person was killed and damage costs amounted to a record c200xc2xa0million in the storm's wake military personnel were deployed to assist in recovery efforts and aid

accompanying a tropical wave over western africa in early septemberxc2xa02010 tracking nearly due west the system emerged into the eastern atlantic ocean on septemberxc2xa06 gradual development took place as convectionxc2xa0xe2x80x93 thunderstorm activityxc2xa0xe2x80x93 consolidated around its center at 0600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa08 the low was deemed sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression while situated roughly 90xc2xa0mi (140xc2xa0km) southeast of the cape verde islands attaining gale-force winds six hours later the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was subsequently named igor by the national hurricane center (nhc){1]development of igor quickly ceased once it was named as a nearby disturbance produced moderate wind shear over the storm displacing convection from its center embedded within a monsoon trough over the eastern atlantic the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on septemberxc2xa09 intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of igor; it would remain so throughout the remainder of the cyclone's existence contrary to its earlier movement the storm's forward motion markedly increased{1] following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center{2] igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa012{1]known atlantic hurricanes with gale diameter of 750 milesrankstormseasondiameter(mi)(km)1sandy201294515202igor201092014803olga200186413904lili199680512955karl20047801255sources: {1]once classified a hurricane igor underwent explosive intensification over the following 24xc2xa0hours during this time satellite observations indicated that the storm's winds increased from 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) to 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) and its barometric pressure decreased by 52xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 153xc2xa0inhg){1] near the end of this phase forecasters at the nhc predicted that igor would attain categoryxc2xa05 status the highest classification on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale{3] with a symmetrical 17xc2xa0mi (27xc2xa0km) wide eye deep convection and spiral banding{4] igor maintained categoryxc2xa04 intensity for nearly five days minor fluctuations took place during this period as multiple eyewall replacement cycles occurred after the first of these cycles the hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak strength around 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa015 with sustained winds of 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) and an estimated minimum pressure of 924xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2729xc2xa0inhg) by this time igor began a northwestward track as it executed a prolonged "c-shaped" curve over the atlantic ocean{1]photograph of hurricane igor's eye on septemberxc2xa014 from the international space stationhurricane igor's extratropical remnant on september 22 about a day before being absorbedpassing roughly 345xc2xa0mi (555xc2xa0km) northeast of the leeward islands on septemberxc2xa017 igor gradually weakened as it experienced increased wind shear and dry air intrusion over the following several days the storm became exceedingly large{1] with tropical storm-force winds covering an area about 865xc2xa0mi (1390xc2xa0km) wide{5] due to an overestimated bias in igor's intensity forecasts from the nhc showed that the storm would strike bermuda as a major hurricane however weakening was more marked than anticipated and by the time its center neared the territory on septemberxc2xa020 winds decreased to 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) igor made its closest approach to bermuda around 0230xc2xa0utc passing roughly 40xc2xa0mi (65xc2xa0km) to the west-northwest{1]once north of bermuda igor began to undergo an extratropical transition as it turned northeastward though deep convection was no longer consistently over its center data from hurricane hunters continued to support hurricane intensity{6] accelerating along the leading edge of a trough over the canadian maritimes the storm intensified within a baroclinic zone as it neared newfoundland{1] the interaction between these two systems allowed the hurricane to strengthen despite moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures{7] around 1500xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa021 igor made landfall near cape race with winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) slightly higher than several hours earlier shortly thereafter the storm completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it became fully embedded within the baroclinic zone after turning northwestward between labrador and greenland the remnants of igor were absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on septemberxc2xa023 within the labrador sea{1]preparations and impact{edit]cape verde and leeward islands{edit]forming near the cape verde islands igor prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches for the southern islands on septemberxc2xa08 though the storm passed relatively close to the region only minimal effects were recorded once the cyclone tracked away from cape verde the watches were discontinued on septemberxc2xa09{1]although several hundred miles from the leeward islands igor produced large swells averaging 9 to 13xc2xa0ft (27 to 40xc2xa0m) in height between septemberxc2xa016 and 21 there were also large breaking waves of 15 to 20xc2xa0ft (46 to 61xc2xa0m) or higher the prolonged period of this event resulted in minor coastal flooding in st croix{8] one person drowned near carambola beach resort after being overcome by large swells{9] similar conditions affected puerto rico where another person drowned{10] on several occasions luquillo was flooded by the surf though no damage took place{11] in nearby haiti still reeling from a devastating earthquake in january officials warned residents of possible relocation from "tent cities" to safer areas an orange alert was declared across the country indicating that heavy rains could result in flooding{12] portions of the greater antilles were affected by large swells and rip currents for several days as igor approached bermuda{13]united states{edit]though igor's closest approach to the contiguous united states only brought it within 600xc2xa0mi (970xc2xa0km) of land its large circulation produced significant swells along the entire east coast high surf advisories were issued in long island new york as waves of 6 to 10xc2xa0ft (18 to 30xc2xa0m) affected the area{14] rip currents in florida pulled two people out to sea who were later rescued{15] one person drowned in surf city north carolina after being overwhelmed by rough surf{16] along the new jersey coastline waves averaging between 6 and 9xc2xa0ft (18 and 27xc2xa0m) and dangerous rip currents were reported{17]bermuda{edit]large waves impacted the coast of bermuda for several days prior to and following igor's passage some of which were up to 15xc2xa0feet (46xc2xa0m) high{18]long seen to be within igor's track bermuda was finally placed under a hurricane watch on septemberxc2xa017 as the threat became imminent later that day the watch was upgraded to a warning as hurricane-force winds were anticipated to impact the islands within the following 24xc2xa0hours this remained in place for nearly three days while igor battered bermuda following the passage of hurricane winds the advisory was changed to a tropical storm warning early on septemberxc2xa020 before being discontinued later that day{1]the bermudian government closed its schools and the bermuda international airport on septemberxc2xa020 and 21 in anticipation of igor{19] no evacuation plans were put in place although a local high school was converted into a shelter for residents who felt unsafe in their homes residents boarded up structures with plywood in order to protect windows tourists on the island wanting to escape the storm left more than a week before igor's arrival additionally a british royal navy vessel and helicopter were stationed offshore to assist with recovery efforts once the storm passed{20] prior to igor's arrival there were fears that the enormous hurricane would be worse than hurricane fabian in 2003 and could "flatten" the territory{21] these fears resulted from forecasts from the national hurricane center which indicated the storm would strike bermuda as a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane however following post-storm analysis it was found that the forecast model consensus overestimated the storm's future intensity{1]although effects from igor were observed in bermuda for several days relatively little rain fell with the highest amount being 319xc2xa0in (81xc2xa0mm) winds proved to be the most significant factor; sustained winds reached 91xc2xa0mph (146xc2xa0kmh) and gusts peaked at 117xc2xa0mph (188xc2xa0kmh) at an unofficial awos station on st david's lighthouse additionally a storm surge of 175xc2xa0ft (053xc2xa0m) took place in st george's this combined with tides to produce a storm tide of over 4xc2xa0ft (122xc2xa0m){1] as the storm arrived the island's airport was shut down earlier than originally planned due to the threat of tornadoes{19] against initial fears igor left relatively little damage across bermuda the most significant impact was from downed trees and powerlines which cut power to 27500xc2xa0residents a few emergency rescues had to be made during the storm but no injuries took place{21] the causeway-bridge connecting st georgexe2x80x99s islands to the main island of bermuda sustained minor damage leaving one lane closed for several days{1] waves over 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) battered the coast{18] breaking several ships from their moorings and tossing them into rocks{21] officials in bermuda stated that the biggest loss from igor would be lessened tourism revenue following a mass exodus prior to the hurricane's arrival{21] throughout the islands damage from the storm was less than 500000{1]canada{edit]rainfall from hurricane igor in newfoundlandon septemberxc2xa020 roughly one day prior to igor's arrival in atlantic canada the canadian hurricane center (chc) issued tropical storm watches and warnings for southern newfoundland and the french territory of saint pierre and miquelon the following day the chc issued a hurricane watch for the eastern and northern coasts{1] although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone{22] early on septemberxc2xa022 all advisories were discontinued as igor moved away from the region{1] in response to the storm's arrival schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at st john's international airport{23] offshore an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of newfoundland on septemberxc2xa019{24] in comparison to hurricane earl two weeks earlier there was substantially less media attention given to igor attributed to the possibility of it going out to sea{22]the combination of a stationary front and significant moisture from hurricane igor resulted in unprecedented rainfall across parts of eastern newfoundland leading to widespread flooding{7]{25] in bonavista more than 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) was estimated to have fallen between septemberxc2xa020 and 21{1]{22]{nb 2] in st lawrence a confirmed 937xc2xa0in (238xc2xa0mm) of rain fell{1] ranking igor as the third-wettest tropical cyclone in canadian history{25] the widespread nature of heavy rains ranked the storm as a 1-in-100 year event similar to the rainfall winds across eastern newfoundland were exacerbated by the interaction of the front and igor{7] in cape pine near where the center of igor tracked sustained winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) and gusts to 107xc2xa0mph (172xc2xa0kmh) battered the area{1]{nb 3] no records for sustained winds or gusts were broken; however it was noted as a 1-in-50 year event even with powerful winter storms taken into account{7] along the coast igor produced a storm tide of 35xc2xa0ft (11xc2xa0m){1] additionally offshore waves reached immense heights measured up to 836xc2xa0ft (255xc2xa0m); one buoy reported a wave of 92xc2xa0ft (28xc2xa0m) but data is subject to further analysis to verify it{22]the most significant impacts from igor were attributed to torrential rains which led to excessive runoff and flash flooding several rivers rose to record levels across the bonavista and burin peninsulas where many roads were washed out entire bridges homes and portions of roads were destroyed{22] in some instances flood waters were higher than entire homes{23] in response to the widespread floods newfoundland power inc warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of septemberxc2xa021 to turn off their main electrical panel if water enters their basement{26] parts of st bernard's xe2x80x93 jacques fontaine had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded some areas of the small town{27] portions of clarenville had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town{23]{27] water and sewage lines in sunnyside broke due to flooding in glovertown downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm both of which were put out by firefighters without injuries{27]roughly 150xc2xa0communities were temporarily isolated as all roads leading to them were severely damaged or washed out{22] overall damage to roadways was regarded as "colossal" by tom hedderson the minister for emergency preparedness{28] a 100xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) section of the trans-canada highway in terra nova national park was severely eroded leaving a large ravine behind and disconnecting the main population of newfoundland from the rest of the island while a bridge washout on the burin peninsula left 20000xc2xa0people cut off from the rest of the island{22]{23] public infrastructure losses were estimated in excess of 100xc2xa0million mainly attributed to roadways{29] on random island a man was killed when his driveway collapsed from flooding and he was swept out to sea{23]in addition to flood damage hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines over large areas and many homes were damaged to varying degrees{22] an estimated 50000xc2xa0residences were left without electricity in the region{30] the small coastal community of south east bight sustained some of the most significant wind damage where entire fishing sheds were hurled into the air{31] along the east coast hiking trail an estimated 5000 trees were downed{32] in all losses from the hurricane were placed at 200xc2xa0million ranking it as the costliest cyclone in newfoundland history{1] in terms of its overall impact igor was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit newfoundland since 1935{33]aftermath{edit]satellite image of hurricane igor on septemberxc2xa021 as it made landfall on newfoundlandin igor's wake a state of emergency was declared for 30xc2xa0communities in newfoundland{31] the mayor of one of the towns affected by igor sam synard remarked that "we've never seen such a violent storm before"{23] more than 50 families involved in the storm-induced destruction were relocated to evacuation shelters{31] electricity was gradually restored to residents; by six days after the hurricane's passage a few hundred had yet to regain power{30]in light of the widespread damage 1000xc2xa0personnel from the canadian military were brought in for recovery efforts{22] the military operation known as operation lama was to last for the duration of the emergency phase in the immediate aftermath an initial deployment of 120xc2xa0soldiers and 40xc2xa0vehicles arrived on septemberxc2xa025 from the canadian forces base gagetown in oromocto new brunswick arrived in newfoundland{34] three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made{30] operation lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings and simultaneously emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500xc2xa0mi (900xc2xa0km) of roads in newfoundland{34] on septemberxc2xa027 government officials stated that it would take months for cleanup efforts to finish{30] ten days after the storm six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly{35] allocation of military aid continued through octoberxc2xa06 though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier{36]roughly a month after the storm a benefit concert was held in st john's the concert raised about 400000 (2010xc2xa0cad) toward storm relief in one night{37] in late october the government of newfoundland and labrador allocated 275000 in funds for 200xc2xa0workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in marystown and port union however union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600xc2xa0work hours{38] following more than a year of discussions the plant's parent company ocean choice international decided to permanently shut down operations on decemberxc2xa02 2011{39] numerous insurance claims reaching 65xc2xa0million by early november were made following hurricane igor's landfall{40] over the course of the recovery phase several complaints including concerns lodged by church ministers that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long{41] roughly ten months after the hurricane work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the burin peninsula{42] by january 24 2011 the salvation army received about 16xc2xa0million worth of donations for residents affected by hurricane igor roughly half of which had been distributed at that point an additional 200000 had been pledged by donors{43]many rivers and streams across newfoundland surpassed their banks washing out adjacent terrainin junexc2xa02011 a federal document detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents affected by the storm the main complaint raised was related to the delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage{44] in an email sent on septemberxc2xa021 2010 denys doiron the nation's emergency preparedness and response officer relayed that local emergency services reported igor to be the worst disaster they have had to deal with doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made{45]nearly a year after the passage of igor a weather buoy from st john's was spotted near the shetland islands north of scotland on septemberxc2xa012 2011{46] in early october newfoundland was again struck by a tropical cyclonexc2xa0xe2x80x93 hurricane ophelia though a weaker storm ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of igor the mayor of marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs especially to culverts to account for flooding{47]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdue to the extensive damage in newfoundland the name igor was retired in the spring of 2011 by request of the meteorological service of canada and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane{48] in canada's report to the world meteorological organization it was stated to be a storm without parallel in the island's history this was only the second time that the meteorological service of canada had requested that a hurricane name be retired (the first was hurricane juan in 2003){49] the hurricane is also considered a probable benchmark for future cyclones in the region having illustrated to residents that they are not immune from hurricanes and their impacts{22] the name was replaced by ian and
