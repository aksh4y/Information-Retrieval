spacecraft with european space agency (esa) astronaut andrxc3xa9 kuipers after more than a week of joint operations and handover activities padalka and fincke officially took command of the station on

space agency of russiaspacewalks{edit]the expedition 9 crew conducted four spacewalks during its stay at the international space station the four spacewalks were devoted to iss maintenance and assembly all four were based out of the pirs docking compartment and used russian orlan spacesuitsbefore these four extravehicular activities (evas) 52 spacewalks had been performed at the iss with 27
