bahamasfloridaother wikiscommons:category:hurricane andrewhurricane andrew was a category 5 atlantic hurricane that struck the bahamas and florida in mid-august 1992 the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state it was the strongest in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the united states until it was surpassed by katrina in 2005 andrew caused major damage in the bahamas and louisiana but the greatest impact was felt in south florida with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 kmh) passing directly through the city of homestead in dade county (now known as miami-dade county) it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations in total it destroyed more than 63500 houses damaged more than 124000 others caused 265 billion in damage{nb 1] and left 65 people deadandrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 16 after spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central atlantic it rapidly intensified into a powerful category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the bahamas on august 23 though it briefly weakened to category 4 while traversing the bahamas it regained its category 5 status before making landfall in florida on elliott key and homestead on august 24 with a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (2723 inhg) at the time of landfall in florida andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the united states several hours later the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico at category 4 strength with the gulf coast of the united states in its path after turning northwestward and weakening further andrew moved ashore near morgan city louisiana as a low-end category 3 storm after moving inland the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity merging with a frontal system over the southern appalachian mountains on august 28hurricane andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the bahamas especially in cat cays lashing the islands with storm surge hurricane-force winds and tornadoes about 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago and there was substantial damage to the transport water sanitation agriculture and fishing sectors andrew left four dead and 250 million in damage throughout the bahamas in parts of southern florida andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177 mph (282 kmh) was observed at a house in perrine the cities of florida city homestead and cutler ridge received the brunt of the storm as many as 14 million people lost power at the height of the storm in the everglades 70000 acres (280 km2) of trees were downed while invasive burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed rainfall in florida was substantial peaking at 1398 inches (355 mm) in western dade county in florida andrew killed 44 and left a record 25 billion in damageprior to making landfall in louisiana on august 26 andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the gulf of mexico leading to 500xc2xa0million in losses for oil companies it produced hurricane-force winds along its path through louisiana damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230000 people without electricity over 80 of trees in the atchafalaya river basin were downed and the agriculture there was devastated throughout the basin and bayou lafourche 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane with 23000 houses damaged 985 others destroyed and 1951 mobile homes demolished property losses in louisiana exceeded 15 billion the hurricane caused the deaths of 17xc2xa0people in the state 6 of whom drowned offshore andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the gulf coast especially in alabama georgia and mississippi in total andrew left 65 dead and caused 265xc2xa0billion in damage it is currently the fifth costliest atlantic hurricane to hit the united states behind only katrina sandy (2012) ike (2008) and harvey (2017)

history{edit]main article: meteorological history of hurricane andrewmap plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on august 14 a ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward an area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the cape verde islands and on august 15 meteorologists began classifying the system with the dvorak technique the thunderstorm activity became more concentrated and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation it is estimated that tropical depression three developed late on august 16 about 1630xc2xa0mi (2620xc2xa0km) east-southeast of barbados{1] embedded within the deep easterlies the depression tracked west-northwestward at 20xc2xa0mph (32xc2xa0kmh){2] initially moderate wind shear prevented strengthening until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into tropical storm andrew at 12:00xc2xa0utc on august 17{1]by early august 18 the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh){3] shortly thereafter the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low{1] on august 19 a hurricane hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center{4] and on the following day a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained; observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high 1015xc2xa0mbar (2997xc2xa0inhg) the flight indicated that andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft after the upper-level low weakened and split into a trough the wind shear decreased over the storm a strong high pressure cell then developed over the southeastern united states which built eastward and caused andrew to turn to the west{1] convection became more organized as upper-level outflow became better established{5] an eye formed and andrew attained hurricane status early on august 22 about 650xc2xa0mi (1050xc2xa0km) east-southeast of nassau bahamas{1] in the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near jupiter florida with winds of 105 mph (170 kmh) on august 25{6] this underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm which would eventually make landfall in south florida{1]a sequence of satellite images depicting hurricane andrew (from right to left) on august 23xe2x80x9325the hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions and began to rapidly intensify late on august 22; in a 24xe2x80x91hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by 47xc2xa0mbar (1388xc2xa0inhg) to a minimum of 922xc2xa0mbar (2723xc2xa0inhg){1] on august 23 the storm attained category 5 status on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale reaching peak winds of 175 mph (280 kmh) a short distance off eleuthera island in the bahamas at 18:00 utc{nb 2]{7] despite its intensity andrew was a small tropical cyclone with winds of 35xc2xa0mph (56xc2xa0kmh) extending out only about 90 mi (150 km) from the center{8] after reaching that intensity the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle{9] at 21:00 utc on august 23 andrew made landfall on eleuthera with winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){7] the cyclone weakened further while crossing the bahama banks and at 01:00 utc on august 24 andrew hit the southern berry islands of the bahamas with winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh){7] as it crossed over the warm waters of the gulf stream the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened{1] at 08:40 utc on august 24 andrew struck elliott key with winds of 165xc2xa0mph (266xc2xa0kmh) and a pressure of 926xc2xa0mbar (2734xc2xa0inhg) about 25xc2xa0minutes after its first florida landfall andrew hit just northeast of homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 922xc2xa0mbar (2723xc2xa0inhg){7] this barometric pressure made andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the united states since hurricane camille in 1969 and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in florida since the labor day hurricane of 1935{1]most intense landfalling hurricanes in

(hpa)source: hurdat{10] hurricaneresearch division{11]as the eye moved onshore in florida the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence and hurricane hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior however andrew weakened as it continued further inland and after crossing southern florida in four hours the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 kmh){1] in the gulf of mexico the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north{12] andrew steadily re-intensified over the gulf of mexico reaching winds of 145 mph (235 kmh) late on august 25{7] as the high pressure system to its north weakened a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest this caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest and winds decreased as andrew approached the gulf coast of the united states{1]at 08:30 utc on august 26 the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi (30 km) west-southwest of morgan city louisiana with winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){7] andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours after entering mississippi the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on august 27 accelerating northeastward the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system and by midday on august 28 andrew merged with a frontal system while located over the southern appalachian mountains{1] the remnants continued moving towards the northeast and it lost its identity later that day merging with the remnants of hurricane lester and a frontal zone over the mid-atlantic{13]post-analysis on andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on august 22 and early on august 26 in real time the national hurricane center assessed its peak intensity as 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh){14] which was upgraded to 155 mph (250 kmh) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended{1] however a 2004 paper by christopher landsea and others concluded that andrew became a category 5 hurricane near the bahamas on august 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 kmh) the paper also indicated that andrew briefly re-intensified into a category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in south florida early on august 24 the storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching louisiana but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph (195 kmh) to 115 mph (185 kmh){7]preparations{edit]visual comparison of hurricane floyd and hurricane andrew while at similar positions and nearly identical intensitiesbahamas{edit]main article: effects of hurricane andrew in the bahamasbahamas prime minister hubert ingraham who took office while the storm was active urged residents to "take this hurricane seriously"{15] before the hurricane passed through the bahamas forecasters predicted a storm surge of up to 18xc2xa0ft (55xc2xa0m) as well as up to 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) of rain{16] on august 22 hurricane watches were issued from andros and eleuthera islands northward through grand bahama and great abaco they were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day and on august 23 additional warnings were issued for the central bahamas including cat island exuma san salvador island and long island all watches and warnings were discontinued on august 24{1] advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country{17] a total of 58xc2xa0shelters were opened at churches government buildings and schools{15]florida{edit]main article: effects of hurricane andrew in floridahurricane andrew shortly after landfall near homesteadinitially forecasters predicted tides up to 14xc2xa0ft (43xc2xa0m) above normal along the east coast of florida near the potential location of landfall{18] rainfall was projected to be between 5 and 8xc2xa0in (130 and 200xc2xa0mm) along the path of the storm in addition the national hurricane center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in central and south florida during the passage of andrew on august 23 and august 24{19] several tropical storm and hurricane warnings were issued for much of central and south florida from titusville on the east coast to venice on the west coast included in the warnings were lake okeechobee and all of the florida keys by 18:00 utc on august 24 all watches and warnings issued were discontinued after andrew progressed into the gulf of mexico{1]governor lawton chiles declared a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the florida national guard many residents evacuated most voluntarily from broward charlotte collier lee martin dade monroe palm beach and sarasota counties a total of 142xc2xa0shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84340xc2xa0people{20] in dade county alone 515670xc2xa0people were ordered to evacuate{21] as andrew was approaching an estimated 20000xe2x80x9330000xc2xa0tourists were in the florida keys (monroe county){22] overall almost 12xc2xa0million people evacuated which contributed to the low number of fatalities despite the intensity of the storm{1] many evacuees also checked into hotels with rooms completely booked as far north as ocala ultimately the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of florida mostly along interstate 95 united states coast guard vessels on or near the florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea{23] government offices and public and private schools were closed from monroe county northward to st lucie county{24] many colleges and universities in southeast florida also closed including barry university broward community college florida atlantic university florida international university nova southeastern university and the university of miami{25] major airports such as the fort lauderdalexe2x80x93hollywood{25] key west{26] miami{15] and palm beach international airports closed{25]gulf coast of the united states{edit]satellite image of hurricane andrew approaching louisianashortly after the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico from southern florida the national hurricane center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the gulf coast of the united states beginning at 13:00 utc on august 24 after the initial hurricane watch from mobile alabama to sabine pass texas the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from mobile alabama to freeport texas all watches and warnings on the gulf coast were discontinued late on august 26 after the hurricane moved inland over louisiana{1]due to the hurricane's threat workers fled oil platforms in the gulf of mexico while the coast guard moved their boats inland{27] officials in mississippi suggested that about 100000xc2xa0people evacuate the coastal counties{28] shelters were opened in hancock and harrison counties though only 68xc2xa0people went to a shelter in the former{29] gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for august 25 were postponed{28]in louisiana governor edwin edwards declared a state of emergency{27] about 125xc2xa0million people evacuated from the central and southeast louisiana{1] while approximately 60000xc2xa0others fled parishes in southwest louisiana{30] a mandatory evacuation from grand isle was ordered by mayor andy valence and the city council{31] in new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200000xc2xa0residents in the low-lying areas of the city{32] nine shelters were opened in the city which were occupied by thousands of people{28] in response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like hurricane andrew could over-top the levees workers closed 111xc2xa0floodgates{32] the louis armstrong new orleans international airport closed with jumbo jets being flown to other airports a total of 250xc2xa0members of the louisiana national guard patrolled the streets during the storm the red cross assisted with opening a shelter at the university of southwest louisiana's cajundome in lafayette equipped to handle about 2000xc2xa0people{28]in texas about 250000xc2xa0people evacuated orange and jefferson counties{1] galveston city manager doug matthews advised residents to develop an evacuation plan in the event that the city chose to call for evacuations{33] the city later decided against ordering an evacuation{34] school was canceled on august 25 for beaumont port arthur and other areas of central jefferson county{33] while schools were closed in dickinson high island hitchcock la marque santa fe and texas city on august 26 college of the mainland galveston college and texas am university at galveston were also closed{35] emergency management crews in corpus christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear{33] the comal county chapter of the red cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the corpus christi

national hurricane center{37]{38]{39]{nb 3]though andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan it caused extreme damage especially in the bahamas florida and louisiana the vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds although a few tornadoes spawned by andrew caused considerable damage in louisiana throughout the areas affected almost 177000xc2xa0people were left homeless outside of the bahamas florida and louisiana effects were widespread although damage was minimal overall 265xc2xa0billion in losses and 65xc2xa0fatalities were attributed to andrew{1] with some estimates ranging as high as 34xc2xa0billion{40] andrew was the costliest hurricane in us history at the time but is now fifth following hurricanes katrina (2005) sandy (2012) harvey (2017) and ike (2008){41]bahamas{edit]main article: effects of hurricane andrew in the bahamasin the bahamas andrew produced hurricane-force winds in north eleuthera new providence north andros bimini and the berry islands{42] the storm first struck north eleuthera{43] where it produced a high storm surge{17] at a small village in the northwestern portion of the island more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage one person drowned from the surge in lower bogue eleuthera and two others died in the bluff on current island the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses{44] harbour island near eleuthera reported wind gusts of 138xc2xa0mph (222xc2xa0kmh) xe2x80x93 the strongest gust speed observed in the bahamas during andrew's passage{1] news reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on harbor island{45]andrew produced several tornadoes in the area{46] at the capital city of nassau sustained winds reached 92xc2xa0mph (148xc2xa0kmh) while gusts up to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) were reported{1] only minor damage occurred in nassau according to the bahamas red cross{45] but on the private island of cat cay many expensive homes sustained heavy damage{47] much of the northwestern bahamas received damage{46] with estimated monetary losses reaching 250xc2xa0million{1] a total of 800 houses were destroyed leaving 1700 people homeless additionally the storm caused severe damage to the sectors of transport communications water sanitation agriculture and fishing{45] four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane of which three were direct;{1] the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the storm{44]{nb 4]florida{edit]main article: effects of hurricane andrew in floridadamage from hurricane andrew in a large mobile home communityoverall andrew caused about 253xc2xa0billion in damage in florida{1] making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state{49] almost all of the damage in florida was caused by strong winds{1] of the 44xc2xa0deaths attributed to the storm 15xc2xa0were direct fatalities while 29xc2xa0were indirectly caused by the storm it was later noted that if andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north it would have significantly affected miami and fort lauderdale which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll{1] an analysis by the american meteorological society indicated that unlike most hurricanes wind damage from andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm{50] some officials in florida considered andrew the worst storm in the state since the labor day hurricane in 1935{51] the storm surge from andrew caused more than 500xc2xa0million in losses to boats and buildings{1]{52] at the height of the storm more than 14xc2xa0million people lost electricity and another 150000xc2xa0were without telephone service{53] it is estimated that throughout florida the storm damaged 101241xc2xa0homes and destroyed approximately 63000xc2xa0others xe2x80x93 the vast majority in dade county xe2x80x93 with about 175000xc2xa0people rendered homeless{1]{54] in addition to homes the storm damaged or destroyed 82000xc2xa0businesses 32900 acres (13300xc2xa0ha) of farmland 31xc2xa0public schools 59xc2xa0health

the storm were disposed of{55]tides were generally between 4 to 6xc2xa0ft (12 to 18xc2xa0m) above normal in the biscayne bay area though near the burger king international headquarters tides reached as high as 169xc2xa0ft (52xc2xa0m) above normal storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light with a peak height of 6xc2xa0ft (18xc2xa0m) in everglades city and goodland strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area stretching from key largo to the miami beach area a house near perrine initially reported a wind gust of 212xc2xa0mph (341xc2xa0kmh) before the structure and instrument were destroyed; this measurement was reduced to 177xc2xa0mph (285xc2xa0kmh) after wind-tunnel testing at the virginia polytechnic institute and state university of the same type of anemometer revealed a 165 error several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed at the national hurricane center building in coral gables sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) and gusts to 164xc2xa0mph (264xc2xa0kmh) were measured before the anemometer failed the highest sustained wind speed for the storm was 146xc2xa0mph (235xc2xa0kmh) recorded at the turkey point nuclear generating station before instruments also failed there in key largo a 13-minute wind speed of 114xc2xa0mph (183xc2xa0kmh) was reported tropical storm force winds reached as far north as west palm beach on the west coast of florida sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on marco island though a wind gust of 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) was reported in collier county rainfall was generally light possibly as a result of the storm's relatively fast movement{1] overall precipitation from andrew peaked at nearly 14xc2xa0in (360xc2xa0mm) in western dade county heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic with precipitation reported as far north as central florida{13]damage in lakes by the bayalthough effects from andrew were catastrophic the extent of damage was limited mainly from kendall to key largo due to the small wind field of the storm the hurricane destroyed 90 of mobile homes in the county including 99 of mobile homes in homestead{1] at the homestead air force base most of the 2000xc2xa0buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable{56] damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure{57] nearby in the small town of florida city over 120xc2xa0homes were demolished and 700xc2xa0others were damaged while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair including city hall{58] further north damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as country walk and saga bay resembled that of an f3 tornado as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from 130 to 150xc2xa0mph (210 to 240xc2xa0kmh) below the threshold for an f3 tornado{59] four of the five condominiums at naranja lakes were destroyed{60] the cutler ridge mall suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm significant looting was reported at that location{61] more than 50xc2xa0streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines{62] agriculture suffered extensively as well with an 85 loss to fruit crops such as avocados limes and mangoes crop damage in dade county totaled about 509xc2xa0million{63] the county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane totaling approximately 25xc2xa0billion andrew left at least 40xc2xa0deaths in the county 15xc2xa0direct and 25xc2xa0indirect{1]the dadeland mobile home park after andrewelsewhere effects were relatively minimal except in broward monroe and collier counties in broward county on the north side of the storm's path impact in several municipalities was primarily limited to downed trees several of which fell onto roads and power lines in pembroke park one of the worst impacted cities in the county approximately 260xc2xa0mobile homes were damaged storm surge left coastal flooding in some areas especially along state roads a1a and 858{64] property damage reached about 100xc2xa0million and three fatalities were reported in broward county{1] in everglades national park and biscayne national park more than 25 of trees were damaged or destroyed including one-fourth of the royal palms and one-third of the pine trees in the former{65] in addition to the damage at everglades national park effects in monroe county were significant especially in the upper florida keys strong winds damaged billboards awnings commercial signs several boats planes trees{26] and 1500xc2xa0homes with 300xc2xa0of those becoming uninhabitable{22] damage in that county was about 131xc2xa0million{1] in collier county to the north of the storm's path sustained winds up to 98xc2xa0mph (158xc2xa0kmh) were observed in chokoloskee{66] storm surge flooded low-lying areas particularly in goodland everglades city and marco island many boats were damaged or destroyed by the rough seas and strong winds{67] the storm destroyed 80xc2xa0mobile homes and severely damaged 400xc2xa0others{68] property damage in the county reached about 30xc2xa0million{1]louisiana{edit]damage from an f3 tornado spawned by andrew in laplaceafter hitting florida andrew moved across the gulf of mexico and made landfall about 23xc2xa0mi (37xc2xa0km) west-southwest of morgan city in south-central louisiana; at landfall the maximum sustained winds were 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) the highest sustained wind speed observed was 96xc2xa0mph (154xc2xa0kmh) while a wind gust as strong as 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) was recorded; both measurements were taken at the fire station in berwick as it moved ashore the hurricane produced storm tides of at least 8xc2xa0ft (24xc2xa0m) above normal causing flooding along the coast from vermilion bay to lake borgne{1] off louisiana a group of six fishermen from alabama drowned{29] heavy rains accompanied the storm's passage through the

156xc2xa0billion{70] a total of 17xc2xa0deaths occurred in louisiana 8xc2xa0directly and 9xc2xa0from indirect causes{1] at least 75xc2xa0injuries were reported{73]remainder of the united states{edit]rainfall summary of hurricane andrew in the united stateswhile andrew was entering the gulf of mexico oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms{74] the storm damaged 241xc2xa0oil and gas facilities and toppled 33xc2xa0platforms off the coast of louisiana{75] causing significant disruptions in production additionally 83xc2xa0pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree the oil industry lost about 12xc2xa0million per day in the days following andrew and 4xc2xa0million daily by three weeks later{75] initially a production loss of 240000 to 270000xc2xa0barrels per day occurred xe2x80x93 approximately one-third of production throughout the gulf of mexico{76] overall hurricane andrew caused about 500xc2xa0million in damage to oil facilities{1]as andrew moved ashore in louisiana its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about 13xc2xa0ft (040xc2xa0m) in sabine pass texas winds were generally light in the state reaching 30xc2xa0mph (48xc2xa0kmh) in port arthur{1] as andrew crossed into mississippi 3xc2xa0severe thunderstorm warnings 21xc2xa0tornado warnings and 16xc2xa0flood warnings were issued funnel clouds were observed near the path of the storm{77] along with 26xc2xa0tornadoes{78] structural damage was generally minimal occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms one tornado in kemper county destroyed a mobile home while another twister in lauderdale county demolished a mobile home damaged five other dwellings and injured four people{79] additionally a possible tornado damaged a home and two trailers in lawrence county{77] strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state{77] much of mississippi received 3 to 5xc2xa0in (76 to 127xc2xa0mm) of rain while areas near the southwest corner of the state observed over 7xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) of precipitation{80] with a peak of 930xc2xa0in (236xc2xa0mm) at sumrall{81] flooding was mostly limited to the inundation of minor roads and low-lying areas in several counties{80]in alabama precipitation amounts in the state peaked at 471xc2xa0in (120xc2xa0mm) in aliceville{81] the rainfall caused flooding in low-lying areas and creeks covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses{80] along the coast the storm produced flooding and high tides{29] along dauphin island high tides left severe beach erosion with portions of the island losing up to 30xc2xa0ft (91xc2xa0m) of sand{29] three damaging tornadoes occurred in the state the most damaging tornado was spawned in elmore county and moved from an area northeast of montgomery to the south of wetumpka and briefly lifted during its 05xc2xa0mi (080xc2xa0km) track the tornado destroyed 2xc2xa0homes and damaged 18xc2xa0homes 1xc2xa0mobile home 2xc2xa0barns and 1xc2xa0vehicle one person was injured by the twister{70] sustained winds in the state were below tropical storm force though a wind gust of 41 mph (67 kmh) was observed in huntsville{1] although 48 counties in alabama reported wind damage impact across the state was generally minor{29]tropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into georgia several counties in the northwest and west-central portions of the state reported downed trees and tree limbs and fallen power lines causing scattered power outages but structural damage was generally minor in carroll county several dwellings and barns were damaged with one mobile home destroyed at the columbus metropolitan airport buildings billboards and signs were damaged additionally a tornado in floyd county near rome snapped and uprooted several trees damaged several fences and homes and flipped over a trailer tossing it on top of four cars{70] monetary losses in the state reached about 100000{1] in tennessee thunderstorm winds and tornadoes associated with andrew downed trees and power lines but caused little overall impact to homes and buildings similarly in north carolina thunderstorm winds toppled trees and power lines at a number of locations in the mountainous areas of the state especially in avery county rainfall from andrew spread across the southeastern united states along the appalachian mountains corridor; totals of over 5xc2xa0in (125xc2xa0mm) were reported where georgia and south carolina meet north carolina{13] in west virginia the remnants of andrew combined with a cold front to produce 15 to 25xc2xa0in (38 to 64xc2xa0mm) of rain over portions of the state causing flooding in areas of morgantown with poor drainage the remnants of andrew also spawned several tornadoes in maryland a tornado in howard county damaged several homes some extensively the twister also tossed and wrecked a recreational vehicle and its trailer downed trees and flattened cornfields{70] precipitation continued along the path of andrew's remnants through the mid-atlantic and ohio valley with precipitation measured as far north as upstate new york{13]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane names and tropical cyclone naming xc2xa7xc2xa0retirementafter the season had ended the world meteorological organization's ra iv hurricane committee retired the name andrew from the list of future names for atlantic tropical cyclones and replaced it with alex{82]{83] the name andrew will never be used again for another atlantic hurricanebahamas{edit]initially the bahamas national disaster coordinator believed that foreign aid was not required but shortly after the storm the government of the united kingdom began distributing blankets food ice and water hmsxc2xa0cardiff a royal navy type 42 destroyer was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the gregorytown area{17]{45] in addition assistance came from canada japan and the united states as well as the united nations the american red cross delivered 100xc2xa0tents 100xc2xa0rolls of plastic sheeting and 1000xc2xa0cots{45] rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands however trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected (around 2) officials expected a 10xe2x80x9320 decline in tourism{47] the bahamian government observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient reformed the national emergency and management agency{84]united states{edit]sign pointing in the direction of a relief camp in south floridaafter assessing the devastation in florida and louisiana us president george h w bush initially proposed a 71xc2xa0billion aid package to provide disaster benefits small-business loans agricultural recovery food stamps and public housing for victims of hurricane andrew{85] after the house of representatives appropriated aid to victims of hurricane iniki in hawaii and typhoon omar in guam the cost was later increased to 111xc2xa0billion the bill which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time was passed by congress as house resolutionxc2xa05620 on septemberxc2xa018{86] and signed into law by president bush on septemberxc2xa023{87] the state of florida alone received 9xc2xa0billion through the disaster relief bill{88]the federal emergency management agency (fema) was criticized for its slow response in both florida and louisiana even a month prior to andrew the house committee on appropriations xe2x80x93 which oversees the budget for fema xe2x80x93 released a report calling the agency a "political dumping ground" and a "turkey farm" due to its "weak inexperienced leaders" congressman s william green of new york a member of the appropriations committee stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to hurricane hugo in 1989 however green also criticized local officials for expecting "them {fema] to come and run the whole show" some fema officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the los angeles riots fema spokesman grant peterson stated "24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster"{89]florida{edit]in florida president bush assessed damage in areas south of miami with florida governor lawton chiles{51] the president quickly declared the region a disaster area which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in broward collier dade and monroe counties{90] lieutenant governor buddy mackay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking "like a war zone"{91] governor chiles considered asking the florida state legislature to raise taxes stating that "no matter how much congress appropriates to repair damage from hurricane andrew the state will face a substantial cleanup bill"{85] instead of raising taxes chiles signed a bill into law on decemberxc2xa017 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes as well as government and school buildings and functions additionally the bill allowed south floridians to keep an estimated 500xc2xa0million in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts{92]clean-up after hurricane andrew in dade countycrime especially looting and theft rose sharply in the areas south of miami immediately after andrew reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern dade county additionally looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm even in homes where few possessions remained{60]{93] initially the slow response of federal aid prompted dade county emergency management director kate hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference "where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? they keep saying we're going to get supplies for god's sake where are they?" almost immediately president bush promised "help is on the way" and mobile kitchens food and tents along with over 20000 units from the florida army national guard (124th infantry regiment from florida); the 24th infantry division from fort stewart the 82nd airborne division in fort bragg and the 10th mountain division from fort drum{94]{95] in order to provide temporary housing for the homeless military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in florida city and homestead{96] while a sixth tent city was opened at the miccosukee indian reservation shortly after labor day weekend{97] the government of canada dispatched a team 90xc2xa0military engineers to repair community centers hospitals and schools additionally a crew of 300xc2xa0military personnel were sent to miami via the hmcs protecteur to assist american relief teams{98]the storm struck florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign a poll conducted by cbs news in september showed that 65 of dade county residents approved of bush's handling of the disaster while 61 of residents approved statewide despite the support of bush's response and his proposal to rebuild homestead air force base he benefited little politically and trailed 48xe2x80x9342 against bill clinton in another poll taken in september additionally 75 of voters in dade county and 82 of floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to andrew would not impact their vote in november{99] bush went on to carry the state of florida but by a margin of only 189{100] the hurricane also impacted governor chiles politically the state's response to the storm was perceived as poor sinking chiles' approval rating to 22 while his disapproval rating rose to 76 however chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election{101]in the aftermath of the storm extensive psychological effects were documented difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) the cases of ptsd primarily impacted children a sampling of 378xc2xa0adolescents by the university of south carolina's department of epidemiology and biostatistics indicated that 3 of males and 9 of females met the criteria for ptsd{102] dozens of children in the area attempted suicide while counselors reported that between 50 and 60xc2xa0children discussed killing themselves between decemberxc2xa01992 and januaryxc2xa01993{103] a panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the university of miami agreed that as many as 90 of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of ptsd{104] within six months the circumstances related to the aftermath of andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides{105]a home destroyed by the stormalthough proposals to rebuild homestead air force base were initially rejected{57] the united states department of defense eventually expended over 100xc2xa0million to begin repairs unsalvageable buildings were demolished reconstruction then began on a florida air national guard tower air traffic control tower and maintenance hangars next the rebuilding of communications medical security facility vehicle maintenance and wing headquarters buildings began on marchxc2xa05 1994 the base reopened as homestead air reserve base{106] prior to andrew the base employed approximately 6500xc2xa0military personnel and 1000xc2xa0civilians and annually added about 450xc2xa0million to the local economy{107]{108] after its reopening major bobby d'angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that xe2x80x93 between 180xc2xa0million and 200xc2xa0million{108] the city of homestead spent about 6xc2xa0million on rebuilding the homestead sports complex despite this the cleveland indians fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans moved their spring training location to chain of lakes park in winter haven{109]{110] as homes were being rebuilt fema provided free temporary mobile homes for 3501xc2xa0families and financial assistance to more than 40000xc2xa0other families for staying in hotel rooms paying rent and repairing homes{111] nearly two years after andrew about 70 of homes in homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt additionally of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout dade county 36000xc2xa0had been restored by july 1994{112]more than 930000xc2xa0policyholders in south florida lost coverage after 11xc2xa0insurance companies went bankrupt caused by more than 600000xc2xa0insurance claims filed this led the florida legislature to create new entities such as the joint underwriting association the florida windstorm underwriting association and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity{113] stricter building codes were created in florida in the aftermath of hurricane andrew a survey by tim marshall and richard herzog of the haag engineer company in carrollton texas highlighted several construction issues on the roof of some homes the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper which could easily be ripped by straight line winds at houses with shingled roofs it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis also allowing them to be torn away after the tiles or shingles were peeled off the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather eventually the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure leading to roof collapses{114]tent cities were constructed to house displaced residentsin julyxc2xa01996 governor chiles established the florida building codes study commission with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system the commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed amended and administered by over 400xc2xa0local jurisdictions and state agencies{115] the florida building code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002{116] it phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes after hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne in 2004 a study conducted by the university of florida in the following year noted that "homes built under the new florida building code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001" a report by the florida legislature in 2006 after hurricanes dennis katrina and wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion indicating that "they added further evidence that the florida building code is working"{117]the hurricane also transformed the demographics of dade county a migration of mostly white families northward to broward and palm beach county was ongoing but accelerated after andrew{118] many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate{119] the population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern broward county where land development was pushed "years ahead of schedule"{118] similar migration occurred within the jewish community although there are areas of dade county that still have significant jewish populations many jews resettled to coral springs west fort lauderdale hallandale beach plantation and tamarac in broward county and boca raton and west palm beach in palm beach county{120] the county had a net loss of about 36000xc2xa0people in 1992 while broward and palm beach counties gained about 17000 and 2300xc2xa0dade county residents respectively{109] by 2001 230710xc2xa0people had moved from dade county to broward county while 29125xc2xa0dade county residents had moved to palm beach county however as broward county became more crowded 100871xc2xa0people relocated from broward county to palm beach county{121] consequently the hispanic population in south dade county climbed rapidly{119] in homestead for example the latino population increased from 30 to 45 between 1990 and 2000{122]during the storm a facility housing burmese pythons was destroyed allowing many of them to escape into the everglades although burmese pythons xe2x80x93 native to southeast asia xe2x80x93 had been sighted in everglades national park since the 1980s the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to the establishment of breeding populations in florida due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species{123] the population of burmese pythons exploded with possibly as many as 300000 in the everglades alone{124] efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these invasive snakes including a ban on importation of the species to the united states since januaryxc2xa02012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python{125]{126]louisiana{edit]on august 26 george h w bush toured devastated areas of louisiana with governor edwin edwards{127] president bush remarked "the destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years" but noted that damage was less severe than in florida after his visit to louisiana president bush declared only terrebonne parish as a disaster area{72] but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration{128] fema initially opened five field offices throughout louisiana these centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid{129] after franklin mayor sam jones and congressman billy tauzin criticized fema for failing to open a field office in franklin fema promised to do so in the first few days following the storm louisiana national guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees roofing shingles and torn aluminum siding the state national guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water{130] about 1300xc2xa0national guardsmen were deployed to southern louisiana{131]in early september officials announced that 1400xc2xa0mobile homes homes and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable{131] house resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of louisiana{86]{87] in early december the small business administration (sba) approved 332xc2xa0million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses by then fema had received about 43600 applications for aid while approving 359xc2xa0million in grants to over 18000 households that were ineligible for loans from the sba or were uninsured in addition to the mobile homes already provided fema spent 226 million on disaster housing{132]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of florida hurricanes (1975xe2x80x9399)1926 miami hurricane1947 fort lauderdale hurricanehurricane irmanotes{edit]^ all damage figures are in
