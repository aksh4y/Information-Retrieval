1993xe2x80x9394 1994xe2x80x9395 1995xe2x80x9396the 1993xe2x80x9394 south pacific cyclone season was a near average tropical cyclone season with five tropical cyclones occurring within the south pacific to the east of 160xc2xb0e the season officially ran from november 1 1993 to april 30 1994 with the first disturbance of the season forming on december 26 and the last disturbance dissipating on april 25during the season tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the regional specialized meteorological center (rsmc) in nadi fiji and the tropical cyclone warning centers (tcwc) in brisbane australia and wellington new zealand{1] throughout the season the united states navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings through its joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) and naval western and oceanography center (nwoc){2] tropical cyclones that were located between 160xc2xb0e and 120xc2xb0w as well as the equator and 25xc2xb0s were monitored by rsmc nadi while any that were located to the south of 25xc2xb0s between 160xc2xb0e and 120xc2xb0w were monitored by tcwc wellington{1] during the season the jtwc issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160xc2xb0e and 180xc2xb0 while the npmoc issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between the 180xc2xb0 and the american coast rsmc nadi and tcwc wellington both used the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period during the season while the jtwc and the npmoc measured sustained windspeeds over a 1xc2xa0-minute period{1]{2]contents1 seasonal summary2 systems21 severe tropical cyclone rewa22 tropical cyclone 07p23 severe tropical cyclone sarah24 severe tropical cyclone theodore25 severe tropical cyclone

nauru{3] over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed as it moved towards the south-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly flow{4] early on december 28 tcwc nadi started to monitor the disturbance as a tropical depression{5] later that day the jtwc classified the depression as tropical cyclone 05p before tcwc nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it rewa{5]{6]{7] over the next few days the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest passing through the solomon islands on december 29 and affecting the southeastern islands of papua new guinea{4]{8] as it moved through the solomon islands rewa moved out of the south pacific basin and into the australian region{5]after affecting new caledonia rewa weakened into a tropical depression and moved towards the northwest over the next few days before re-entering the australian basin during january 10 and started to show signs of reintensification over the next few days the cyclone moved towards the north north-west and started to affect papua new guinea for the second time before it was renamed rewa during january 13 while it recurved and started to move towards the south-west over the next few days the cyclone continued to move to the south-east towards the south pacific basin before as it peaked in intensity on january 16 as a category 5 severe tropical cyclone rewa turned and started to move towards the south-west over the next few days the cyclone gradually weakened while it moved towards the south-west and a predicted landfall near mackay in queensland however during january 18 rewa interacted with an upper level trough and as a result turned and started to move towards the south-east along the queensland coast rewa then degenerated into an extratropical cyclone during january 20 with its

near fiji with peak windspeeds of 55xc2xa0kmh (35xc2xa0mph) equivalent to a tropical depression during the next day the depression remained broad and poorly organized as it moved towards the southeast later that day 07p moved across tonga's northern islands before the npmoc issued their final advisory on january 8 as the system weakened into a remnant low{9]{10]severe tropical cyclone

(95xc2xa0mi) to the north of honiara{11] during that day the disturbance moved towards the southeast and passed over several of the solomon islands before emerging into the australian basin{11] over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the southwest before re-curving and moving southeastwards{11] on april 24 as it moved back into the south pacific basin the jtwc initiated advisories on the disturbance designating it as tropical cyclone 29p with peak windspeeds equivalent to a tropical depression{11]{12] as the system was classified it recurved again and started to move slowly towards the northwest and started to feel the effects of a high amount of vertical windshear{11]{12] as a result of the windshear the center became exposed and displaced from the deep convection before the jtwc issued their final advisory on april 25 as 29p weakened into an area of low pressure before dissipating later that day about 600xc2xa0km (375xc2xa0mi) to the southwest of honiara{11]{12]season effects{edit]this table lists all the storms that developed in the south pacific basin during the 1993xe2x80x9394 season it includes their
