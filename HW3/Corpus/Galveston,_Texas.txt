external linkshistory{edit]main article: history of galveston texasexploration and 19th century development{edit]plan of the city of galveston texas (circa 1845)map of city of galveston (circa 1904)galveston island was originally inhabited by members of the karankawa and akokisa tribes who called the island auia the spanish explorer cabeza de vaca and his crew were shipwrecked on the island or nearby in november 1528{5] calling it "isla de malhado" ("isle of bad fate") they began their years-long trek to a spanish settlement in mexico city{6] during his charting of the gulf coast in 1785 the spanish explorer josxc3xa9 de evia named the island villa gxc3xa1lvez or gxc3xa1lveztown in honor of bernardo de gxc3xa1lvez y madrid count of gxc3xa1lvez{6]the island's first permanent european settlements were constructed around 1816 by the pirate louis-michel aury to support mexico's rebellion against spain{7] in 1817 aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against spain to find galveston occupied by the pirate jean lafitte{7] lafitte organized galveston into a pirate "kingdom" he called "campeche" anointing himself the island's "head of government"{8] lafitte remained in galveston until 1821 when the united states navy forced him and his raiders off the island{8]{9]in 1825 the congress of mexico established the port of galveston and in 1830 erected a customs house{10] galveston served as the capital of the republic of texas when in 1836 the interim president david g burnet relocated his government there{10] in 1836 the french-canadian michel branamour menard and several associates purchased 4605 acres (1864xc2xa0km2) of land for 50000 to found the town that would become the modern city of galveston{11]{12]{13] as anglo-americans migrated to the city they brought along or purchased enslaved african-americans some of whom worked domestically or on the waterfront including on riverboatsin 1839 the city of galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the congress of the republic of texas{13]{14] the city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of german immigrants to texas including jewish merchants{15] together with ethnic mexican residents these groups tended to oppose slavery support the union during the civil war and join the republican party after the warduring this expansion the city had many "firsts" in the state with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions: post office (1836) naval base (1836) texas chapter of a masonic order (1840); cotton compress (1842) catholic parochial school (ursuline academy) (1847) insurance company (1854) and gas lights (1856){13]{16]during the american civil war confederate forces under major general john b magruder attacked and expelled occupying union troops from the city in january 1863 in the battle of galveston{17] in 1867 galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic; 1800 people died in the city{18] these occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century as did cholera epidemicsthe beach hotel catered to vacationers until a fire in 1898the city's progress continued through the reconstruction era with numerous "firsts": construction of the opera house (1870) and orphanage (1876) and installation of telephone lines (1878) and electric lights (1883){13]{16]{19]{20] having attracted freedmen from rural areas in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 3000{21] made up mostly of former slaves but also by persons who were free men of color and educated before the war the "blacks" comprised nearly 25 of the city's population of 13818 that year{22]during the post-civil-war period leaders such as george t ruby and norris wright cuney who headed the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for freedmen helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in galveston and in texas{23]{24] cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during reconstruction; the freedmen's bureau was headquartered here german families sheltered teachers from the north and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read its business community promoted progress and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry{25]by the end of the 19th century the city of galveston had a population of 37000 its position on the natural harbor of galveston bay along the gulf of mexico made it the center of trade in texas it was one of the nation's largest cotton ports in competition with new orleans{26] throughout the 19th century the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was considered the region's primary business center for a time the strand was known as the "wall street of the south"{27] in the late 1890s the government constructed fort crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries in galveston and along the bolivar roads in february 1897 the uss texas (nicknamed old hoodoo) the first commissioned battleship of the united states navy visited galveston during the festivities the ship's officers were presented with a 5000 silver service adorned with various texas motifs as a gift from the state's citizenshurricane of 1900 and recovery{edit]further information: galveston hurricane of 1900 and open era of galvestonmemorial marker along the strand historic district indicating a building that survived the 1900 hurricaneon september 8 1900 the island was struck by a devastating hurricane{28] this event holds the record as the united states' deadliest natural disaster{28]{29] the city was devastated and an estimated 6000 to 8000 people on the island were killed{28] following the storm a 10-mile (16xc2xa0km) long 17 foot (52xc2xa0m) high seawall was built to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surges a team of engineers including henry martyn robert (robert's rules of order) designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintainedsunset route seawall galveston texas (postcard c 1907)the city developed the city commission form of city government known as the "galveston plan" to help expedite recovery{30]despite attempts to draw investment to the city after the hurricane galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity development was also hindered by the construction of the houston ship channel which brought the port of houston into competition with the natural harbor of the port of galveston for sea traffic to further her recovery and rebuild her population galveston actively solicited immigration through the efforts of rabbi henry cohen and congregation b'nai israel galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the galveston movement that between 1907 and 1914 diverted roughly 10000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the northeastern united states{31] additionally numerous other immigrant groups including greeks italians and russian jews came to the city during this period{32] this immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island as well as many other areas of texas and the western usthough the storm stalled economic development and the city of houston developed as the region's principal metropolis galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries in 1905 william lewis moody jr and isaac h kempner members of two of galveston's leading families founded the american national insurance company{33] two years later moody established the city national bank which would become the moody national bank{34]{35]during the 1920s and 1930s the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination{36]{37] under the influence of sam maceo and rosario maceo the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the balinese room which offered entertainment to wealthy houstonians and other out-of-towners combined with prostitution which had existed in the city since the civil war galveston became known as the "sin city" of the gulf{38] galvestonians accepted and supported the illegal activities often referring to their island as the "free state of galveston"{39]{40] the island had entered what would later become known as the "open era"{41]the 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the island city during world war ii the galveston municipal airport predecessor to scholes international airport was re-designated a us army air corps base and named "galveston army air field" in january 1943 galveston army air field was officially activated with the 46th bombardment group serving an anti-submarine role in the gulf of mexico in 1942 william lewis moody jr along with his wife libbie shearn rice moody established the moody foundation to benefit "present and future generations of texans" the foundation one of the largest in the united states would play a prominent role in galveston during later decades helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs{42]postxe2x80x93world war ii{edit]the end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island{43] finally in 1957 texas attorney general will wilson and the texas rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city{44] as these vice industries crashed so did tourism taking the rest of the galveston economy with it{45] neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward{46]downtown galveston as viewed from the airthe island's economy began a long stagnation many businesses relocated off the island during this period; however health care insurance and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy by 1959 the city of houston had long out-paced galveston in population and economic growth beginning in 1957 the galveston historical foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings{47] the 1966 book the galveston that was helped encourage the preservation movement restoration efforts financed by motivated investors notably houston businessman george p mitchell gradually developed the strand historic district and reinvented other areas a new family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many yearswith the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in galveston already home to the university of texas medical branch the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the texas maritime academy predecessor of texas am university at galveston; and by 1967 a community college galveston college had been established{48]in the 2000s property values rose after expensive projects were completed {49] and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased it has made it difficult for middle-class workers to find affordable housing on the island{50]hurricane ike made landfall on galveston island in the early morning of september 13 2008 as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110xc2xa0miles per hour damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall{51]after the storm the island was rebuilt with investments in tourism shipping and continued emphasis on higher education and health care notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure pier and the replacement of the bascule-type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical-lift-type drawbridge to allow heavier freight{52]{53]geography{edit]further information: galveston island and galveston baygalveston from the international space stationthe city of galveston is situated on galveston island a barrier

residential houses the galveston island country club and stores in 2009 chief of police charles wiley said he believed golf carts should be prohibited outside golf courses and west end residents campaigned against any ban on their use{58]in 2011 rice university released a study "atlas of sustainable strategies for galveston island" which argued the west end of galveston was quickly eroding and the city should reduce construction andor population in that area it recommended against any rebuilding of the west end in the event of damage from another hurricane{59]the city of galveston

the 'oleander city'{62] because of a long history of cultivating nerium oleander a subtropical evergreen shrub which thrives on the island{63] oleanders are a defining feature of the city; when flowering (between april and october) they add masses of color to local gardens parks and streets thousands were planted in the recovery following the hurricane of 1900 and galvestonians continue to treasure the plant for its' low water needs tolerance of heat salt spray and sandy soils{64] this makes them especially resistant to the after-effects of hurricanes and tropical storms galveston is reputed to have the most diverse range of oleander cultivars in the world numbering over 100 with many varieties developed in the city and named after prominent galvestonians{65] in 2005 the month of may was declared "oleander month" by the city of galveston{66] and there are also oleander-themed tours of the city exploring the history of the plant on the island since 1967 the international oleander society has operated in galveston which promotes the cultivation of the plant organizes an oleander festival every spring and maintains a commemorative oleander garden in the city{67]{68]climate{edit]galveston's climate is classified as humidxc2xa0subtropical (cfa in kxc3xb6ppen climate classification system){69] prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring both heat from the deserts of mexico and moisture from the gulf of mexico{70] summer temperatures regularly exceed 90xc2xa0xc2xb0f (32xc2xa0xc2xb0c) and the area's humidity drives the heat index even higher while nighttime lows average around 80xc2xa0xc2xb0f (27xc2xa0xc2xb0c){71]{72]{73] winters in the area are temperate with typical january highs above 60xc2xa0xc2xb0f (16xc2xa0xc2xb0c) and lows

rainfall averages well over 40 inches (1000xc2xa0mm) a year with some areas typically receiving over 50 inches (1300xc2xa0mm){74]{75]hurricanes are an ever-present threat during the summer and fall season which puts galveston in coastal windstorm area galveston island and the bolivar peninsula are generally at the greatest risk among the communities near the galveston bay however though the
