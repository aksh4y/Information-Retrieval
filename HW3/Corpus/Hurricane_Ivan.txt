ivanhurricane ivan was a large long-lived cape verde-type hurricane that caused widespread damage in the caribbean and united states the cyclone was the ninth named storm the sixth hurricane and the fourth major hurricane of the active 2004 atlantic hurricane season ivan formed in early september and reached category 5 strength on the saffir-simpson hurricane scaleivan caused catastrophic damage to grenada as a strong category 3 storm heavy damage to jamaica as a strong category 4 storm and then grand cayman cayman islands and the western tip of cuba as a category 5 storm after peaking in strength the hurricane moved north-northwest across the gulf of mexico to strike pensacolamilton florida and alabama as a strong category 3 storm causing significant damage ivan dropped heavy rains on the southeastern united states as it progressed northeast and east through the eastern united states becoming an extratropical cyclone the remnant low from the storm moved into the western subtropical atlantic and regenerated into a tropical cyclone which then moved across florida and the gulf of mexico into louisiana and texas causing minimal damage ivan caused an estimated us18xc2xa0billion (2004xc2xa0usd 228xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) in damages to the united states making it the seventh costliest hurricane ever to strike the countrycontents1 meteorological history11 records2

meteorological history of hurricane ivanmap plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon september 2 2004 tropical depression nine formed from a large tropical wave southwest of cape verde as the system moved to the west it strengthened gradually becoming tropical storm ivan on september 3 and reaching hurricane strength on september 5 1150 miles (1850xc2xa0km) to the east of tobago later that day the storm intensified rapidly and by 5xc2xa0pm edt (2100 utc) ivan became a category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 miles per hour (200xc2xa0kmh) the national hurricane center said that the rapid strengthening of ivan on september 5 was unprecedented at such a low latitude in the atlantic basin{1]{2]the eye of hurricane ivan as seen from the international space station on september 11 2004as it moved east ivan weakened slightly because of wind shear in the area{3] the storm passed over grenada on september 7 battering several of the windward islands as it entered the caribbean sea ivan reintensified rapidly and became a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane just north of the windward netherlands antilles (curaxc3xa7ao and bonaire) and aruba on september 9 with winds reaching 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) ivan weakened slightly as it moved west-northwest towards jamaica as ivan approached the island late on september 10 it began a westward jog that kept the eye and the strongest winds to the south and west however because of its proximity to the jamaican coast the island was battered with hurricane-force winds for hours{1]after passing cuba ivan resumed a more northerly track and regained categoryxc2xa05 strength ivan's strength continued to fluctuate as it moved west on september 11 and the storm attained its highest winds of 163xc2xa0mph (262xc2xa0kmh) as it passed within 30 miles (50xc2xa0km) of grand cayman ivan reached its peak strength with a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars (27xc2xa0inhg) on september 12 ivan passed through the yucatxc3xa1n channel late on september 13 while its eyewall affected the westernmost tip of cuba once over the gulf of mexico it weakened slightly to categoryxc2xa04 strength which it maintained while approaching the gulf coast of the united states{1]hurricane ivan at landfall in baldwin county alabama on the us gulf coastjust before it made landfall in the united states ivan's eyewall weakened considerably and its southwestern portion almost disappeared{citation needed] around 2xc2xa0am cdt september 16 (0700 utc) ivan made landfall on the us mainland in gulf shores alabama as a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane with 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) winds; some hurricane information sources put the winds from hurricane ivan near 130xc2xa0mph (210xc2xa0kmh) upon landfall in alabama and northwestern florida{4]{5] ivan then continued inland maintaining hurricane strength until it was over central alabama ivan weakened rapidly that evening and became a tropical depression the same day still over alabama ivan lost tropical characteristics on september 18 while crossing virginia later that day the remnant low drifted off the us mid-atlantic coast into the atlantic ocean and the low pressure disturbance continued to dump rain on the united states{1]on september 20 ivan's remnant surface low completed an anticyclonic loop and moved across the florida peninsula as it continued west across the northern gulf of mexico the system reorganized and again took on tropical characteristics{1] on september 22 the national weather service "after considerable and sometimes animated in-house discussion {regarding] the demise of ivan"{6] determined that the low was in fact a result of the remnants of ivan and thus named it accordingly on the evening of september 23 the revived ivan made landfall near cameron louisiana as a tropical depression ivan finally dissipated on september 24 as it moved overland into texas{1]records{edit]ivan as a category 3 hurricane east of the windwards on september 5 2004ivan set 18 new records for intensity at low latitudes when ivan first became a category 3 hurricane on september 3 (1800 utc) it was centered near 102xc2xa0degrees north from the equator this is the most southerly location on record for a major hurricane in the atlantic basin{1] just six hours later ivan also became the most southerly categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on record in the atlantic basin when it reached that intensity while located at 106xc2xa0degrees north{7] finally at midnight (utc) on september 9 while centered at 137xc2xa0degrees north ivan became the most southerly categoryxc2xa05 hurricane on record in the atlantic basin{7] the latter record would not be surpassed until hurricane matthew in 2016 which reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity at 134xc2xa0degrees north{8] ivan was also tied with the "cuba hurricane" as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record attaining a minimum atmospheric pressure of 910 millibars (2687 inhg) this record was later surpassed by hurricane maria of 2017 which attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 908 millibars (2681 inhg)ivan had held the world record of 33 (with 32 consecutive) six-hour periods of intensity at or above categoryxc2xa04 strength this record was broken two years later by pacific hurricanetyphoon ioke which had 36 (33 consecutive) six-hour periods at categoryxc2xa04 strength this contributed to ivan's total accumulated cyclone energy (ace) of 7038{9] the tornado outbreak associated with ivan spawned 120 tornadoes more than any other tropical cyclone worldwidescientists from the naval research laboratory at stennis space center mississippi have used a computer model to predict that at the height of the storm the maximum wave height within ivan's eyewall reached 131 feet (40xc2xa0m){10]preparations{edit]caribbean{edit]by september 5 a hurricane watch was posted for barbados early on the following day a tropical storm watch was issued for grenada later that day hurricane watches were also put into effect for saint lucia and martinique a tropical storm warning was issued for saint vincent and grenadines and tobago and grenada by 1500 utc on september 6 the hurricane watches and tropical storm watches and warnings were upgraded to a hurricane warning and expanded to: barbados saint vincent and grenadines saint lucia tobago grenada simultaneously a tropical storm warning was issued for trinidad on september 7 the hurricane warning in effect for several countries was downgraded to a tropical storm warning by september all tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued in the eastern portions of the windward islands{1]as ivan continued westward a hurricane watch was issued for the abc islands on september 8{1] many schools and businesses were closed in the netherlands antilles{11] and about 300xc2xa0people evacuated their homes on curaxc3xa7ao{12]in the caribbean 500000xc2xa0jamaicans were told to evacuate from coastal areas{13] but only 5000 were reported to have moved to shelters{14] 12000 residents and tourists were evacuated from isla mujeres off the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{15]united

evacuations ordered in six other parishes more than one-third of the population of greater new orleans evacuated voluntarily including more than half of the residents of new orleans itself at the height of the evacuation intense traffic congestion on local highways caused delays of up to 12xc2xa0hours about a thousand special-needs patients were housed at the louisiana superdome during the storm ivan was considered a particular threat to the new orleans area because dangers of catastrophic flooding however plaquemines and st bernard parishes suffered a moderate amount of wind damage hurricane preparedness for new orleans was judged poor{16] at one point the media sparked fears of an "atlantean" catastrophe if the hurricane were to make a direct strike on the city{17] these fears were not realized as the storm's path turned further eastin mississippi evacuation of mobile homes and vulnerable areas took place in hancock jackson and harrison counties{18] in alabama evacuation in the areas of mobile and baldwin counties south of interstate 10 was ordered including a third of the incorporated territory of the city of mobile as well as several of its suburbs{19] in florida a full evacuation of the florida keys began at 7:00xc2xa0am edt september 10 but was lifted at 5:00xc2xa0am edt september 13 as ivan tracked further west than originally predicted{20] voluntary evacuations were declared in ten counties along the florida panhandle with strong emphasis in the immediate western counties of escambia santa rosa and okaloosa ivan prompted the evacuation of 270xc2xa0animals at "the little zoo that could" in alabama the evacuation had to be completed within a couple of hours with only 28 volunteers available to move the animals{21]impact{edit]deaths and

very severe and widespread" despite strict building codes which made the islands' buildings well able to withstand even major hurricanes ivan's winds and storm surge were so strong that a quarter or more of the buildings on the islands were reported to be uninhabitable with 85 damaged to some extent much of grand cayman still remained without power water or sewer services for several months later after five months barely half the pre-ivan hotel rooms were usable only one person was killed on the islands{22] though at first many deaths were suspected because of the many graves that were washed up during the storm{citation needed] damage across the territory was catastrophic with losses amounting to us286xc2xa0billion or 183xc2xa0percent of its gross domestic product{24] the letter from the cayman islands government office in the united kingdom 8 october 2004 by mckeeva bush leader of government business details the intensity extent of damage and recovery process during the months that followed{33]elsewhere in the caribbean{edit]there were four deaths in the dominican republic the region's caribbean development bank estimates ivan caused over us3xc2xa0billion (2004xc2xa0usd 38xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) damage on island nations mostly in the cayman islands grenada and jamaica{1] minor damage including some beach erosion was reported in the abc islands{34]even though ivan did not make landfall on cuban soil its storm surge caused localized flooding on santiago de cuba and granma on the southern part of the island at cienfuegos the storm produced waves of 15 feet (46xc2xa0m) and pinar del rxc3xado recorded 133 inches (340xc2xa0mm) of rainfall while there were no casualties on the island the cuban government estimates that about us12xc2xa0billion (2004xc2xa0usd

beach dwellings situated far inland as much as 20 miles (32xc2xa0km) from the gulf coast along the shorelines of escambia bay east bay blackwater bay and ward basin in escambia county and santa rosa county and fort walton beach florida on the eastern side of the storm the area just west of pensacola including the community of warrington (which includes pensacola nas) perdido key and innerarity point took the brunt of the storm some of the subdivisions in this part of the county were completely destroyed with a few key roads in the perdido area only opened in late 2005 over a year after the storm hit shattered windows from gusts and flying projectiles experienced throughout the night of the storm were common as of december 2007 roads remained closed on pensacola beach because of damage from ivan's storm surge{39]in pensacola the interstate 10 escambia bay bridge was heavily damaged with as much as a quarter-mile (400xc2xa0m) of the bridge collapsing into the bay the causeway that carries us highway 90 across the northern part of the same bay was also heavily damaged virtually all of perdido key an area on the outskirts of pensacola that bore the brunt of ivan's winds and rain was essentially leveled high surf and wind brought extensive damage to innerarity point{39]on september 26 2006 over two years after ivan struck the region funding for the last 501xc2xa0fema-provided

inland in west-central alabama endured wind gusts estimated at 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) while montgomery saw wind gusts in the 60 to 70xc2xa0mph (97 to 113xc2xa0kmh) range at the height of the storm{40]the heaviest damage as ivan made landfall on the us coastline was observed in baldwin county in alabama where the storm's eye (and eyewall) made landfall high surf and wind brought extensive damage to orange beach near the border with florida there two five-story condominium buildings were undermined to the point of collapse by ivan's storm surge of 14 feet (43xc2xa0m) both were made of steel-reinforced concrete debris gathered in piles along the storm tide exacerbating the damage when the floodwaters crashed into homes sitting on pilings{41] brewton a community about 50 miles (80xc2xa0km) inland also suffered severe damagein addition to the damage to the southern portions of the state there was extensive damage to the state's electrical grid at the height of the outages alabama power reported 489000xc2xa0subscribers had lost electrical powerxe2x80x94roughly half of its subscriber baserainfall in the united states caused by ivanelsewhere in the united states{edit]further inland ivan caused major flooding bringing the chattahoochee river near atlanta and many other rivers and streams to levels at or near 100-year records the delaware river and its tributaries crested just below their all-time records set by hurricane diane in 1955 locations in southern new hampshire and massachusetts received over 7xc2xa0inches of rainfall from the remnants of ivan causing flooding and mudslides in connecticut high winds moved in quickly and unexpectedly and a boater was killed when his trimaran capsized in 50-knot winds on long island sound{42]in western north carolina many streams and rivers reached well above flood stage in an area that was heavily flood damaged just a week and a half prior from the remnants of hurricane frances causing many roads to be closed high winds contributed to widespread power outages throughout the mountainous region the blue ridge parkway as well as interstate 40 through the pigeon river gorge in haywood county north carolina sustained major damage and landslides were common across the mountains there was major flooding along the french broad river and swannanoa river in asheville north carolina and along the pigeon river near canton north carolina as a result of the rain a major debris flow of mud rocks trees and water surged down peek's creek near franklin north carolina sweeping away 15xc2xa0houses and killing five people{43]{44]the system also spawned deadly tornadoes as far north as maryland{45] and destroyed seven oil platforms in the gulf of mexico while at sea while crossing over the mid-atlantic states ivan's remnants spawned 117 tornadoes across the eastern united states with the 40xc2xa0tornadoes spawned in virginia on september 17 setting a daily record for the commonwealth{46] ivan then moved into the wheeling west virginia and pittsburgh area causing major flooding and gusty winds pittsburgh international airport recorded the highest 24-hour rainfall for pittsburgh recording 595 inches (151xc2xa0mm) of rain{47] ivan's rain caused widespread flooding the juniata river basin was flooded and the frankstown branch crested at its highest level ever{48] after ivan regenerated in the gulf of mexico it caused further heavy rainfall up to 8 inches (200xc2xa0mm) in areas of louisiana and texascanada{edit]on the morning of september 21 the remnant mid-level circulation of ivan combined with a frontal system this produced a plume of moisture over the canadian maritimes for four days producing heavy rainfall totaling 62 inches (160xc2xa0mm) in gander newfoundland high winds of up to 89xc2xa0mph (143xc2xa0kmh) downed trees and caused power outages in newfoundland prince edward island and eastern nova scotia the system produced intense waves of up to 50 feet (15xc2xa0m) near cape bonavista the system killed two when it grounded a fishing vessel and was indirectly responsible for four traffic fatalities in newfoundland{49]aftermath{edit]grenada{edit]see also: effects of hurricane ivan in the lesser antilles and south america xc2xa7xc2xa0grenadagrenada suffered serious economic repercussions following the destruction caused by ivan before ivan the economy of grenada was projected to grow by 47 but the island's economy instead contracted by nearly 3 in 2004 the economy was also projected to grow by at least 5 through 2007 but as of 2005{update] that estimate had been lowered to less than 1 the government of grenada also admitted that government debt 130 of the island's gdp was "unsustainable" in october 2004 and appointed a group of professional debt advisors in january 2005 to help seek a cooperative restructuring agreement with creditors{50]more than us150xc2xa0million was sent to grenada in 2004 to aid reconstruction following ivan but the economic situation remains fragile the international monetary fund reports that as "difficult enough as the present fiscal situation is it is unfortunately quite easy to envisage circumstances that would make it even more so" furthermore "shortfalls in donor financing and tax revenues or events such as a further rise in global oil prices pose a grave risk"{51]jamaica{edit]by two days after ivan's passage usaidxe2x80x99s hurricane recovery program distributed emergency relief supplies for families who were displaced by the storm during phase one of the recovery program communities restored three tourist sites cleared agricultural lands and completed disaster mitigation in addition the us peace corps completed thirty small projects in rural communities and low income neighborhoods 66 health clinics 25 schools and 62 water and sanitation systems were repaired during the first phase of recovery about 1379 farmers herders and micro

provide financial assistance agricultural producers suffering crop and other losses around 132 million (2004 usd) was used to repair federal facilities by several government agencies including: united states coast guard federal bureau of prisons the united states forest service and the federal aviation administration the united states army corps of engineers used 81 million (2004 usd) for restoration of coastal areas affected by ivan in addition 50 million (2004 usd) of which was for disaster and famine assistance funds grenada jamaica and haiti{53]following the storm in alabama more than 167700 people applied for assistance in 65 counties in the state over 51 counties in the state became eligible for public assistance as a result the us department of homeland security's federal

claims in addition there were repairs to public infrastructure such as roads bridges buildings utilities facilities and parks 20 disaster recovery centers were opened in 13 counties which also included the poarch creek indian reservation overall fema paid 90 of the 735 million (2004 usd) while the aema paid for the other 10{54]ivan is suspected of bringing spores of soybean rust from venezuela into the united states the first ever occurrences of soybean rust found in north america since the florida soybean crop had already been mostly harvested economic damage was limited some of the most severe outbreaks in south america have been known to reduce soybean crop yields by half or more{55] following the storm more than 138500 residents in 15 counties of the florida panhandle
