roles carries responsibilities that are essential to the operation of a spacecraft a spacecraft's cockpit filled with sophisticated equipment requires skills differing from those used to manage the

candidates are promoted to astronaut and receive their astronaut pin the pin is issued in two grades silver and gold with the silver pin awarded to candidates who have successfully completed astronaut training and the gold pin to astronauts who have flown in spacechief of the astronaut office is a position not a rankpositions{edit]positiondutiesexamplescommentsmercurypilotoverall mission

flight engineer during launch phase while commander would be in full control of the vehicle perform navigation and mid-course correction procedures during trans-lunar and trans-earth phases of flight command pilot of csm during lunar orbit phase (when the mission commander is in control of the lunar module from separation phase until the lm docked back with csm in lunar orbit) the cm pilot would also have other objectives during lunar orbit phase such as lunar photography research and study for future landing sites for subsequent apollo missions deploy lunar satellite in some cases as well as being responsible for relaying messages from mission control if radio contact with the lm was lost or weak and also responsible for performing an orbital rescue with the lm if it were to malfunction and not be able to perform as needed to rendezvous with csm as planned for in normal cases but this never was needed however the cm pilot was responsible for docking the two ships together when the lm returned to orbit after being on the surfacemichael collinsbackup cmp: william anderslunar module pilotflight engineer of apollo lunar module during descent and ascent of the lm also responsible for its systems during all phases of flight between earth and moon the lmp would callout key information to the commander during the most critical descent and landing phases when all of the commander's attention would be focused out the window and on visually flying the lm to a suitable landing spot on the surface he would also control the navigation computer and other subsystems of the craft while the commander had hands on the controls to fly the ship down manually the last portion of the descent when manual control was taken over from the computerbuzz aldrin second man on the moonbackup lmp:
