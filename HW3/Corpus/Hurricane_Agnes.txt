the time the costliest hurricane to hit the united states in recorded history the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season agnes developed on junexc2xa014 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula initially forming as a tropical depression the storm headed slowly eastward and emerged into the western caribbean sea on junexc2xa015 once in the caribbean the depression began to strengthen and by the following day it became tropical storm agnes thereafter agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of cuba on junexc2xa017 early on junexc2xa018 the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to hurricane agnes heading northward the hurricane eventually made landfall near panama city florida late on junexc2xa019 after moving inland agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered georgia the weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over georgia and into south carolina while over eastern north carolina agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on junexc2xa021 as a result of baroclinic activity early the following day the storm emerged into the atlantic ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near new york city as a strong tropical storm agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on junexc2xa023 and tracked to the northwest of great britain before becoming absorbed by another cyclone on julyxc2xa06though it moved slowly across the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula damage in mexico is unknown although the storm bypassed the tip of cuba heavy rainfall occurred killing seven people in florida agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak with at least 26xc2xa0confirmed twisters two of which were spawned in georgia the tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in florida alone resulted in over 45xc2xa0million (1972xc2xa0usd) in damage and six fatalities at least 2082xc2xa0structures in florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed aboutxc2xa01355 other dwellings experienced minor losses though agnes made landfall as a hurricane no hurricane-force winds were reported along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage especially between apalachicola and cedar key light to moderate rainfall was reported in florida though no significant flooding occurred in georgia damage was limited to two tornadoes which caused approximately 275000 in losses minimal effects were also recorded in alabama connecticut delaware rhode island south carolina and tennessee; though one fatality was reported in delaware the most significant effects by far occurred in pennsylvania mostly due to intense flooding the hurricane severely flooded the susquehanna river and the lackawanna river causing major damage to the wilkes-barrescranton metropolitan area in both pennsylvania and new jersey combined about 43594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged in canada a mobile home was toppled killing two people overall agnes caused 128xc2xa0fatalities and nearly 3xc2xa0billion in damage{1] though more recently it is estimated that there were 21xc2xa0billion in losses associated with the storm due to the significant effects the name agnes was retired in the spring of 1973contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 united states311 florida312 southeastern united states313

cyclogenesis in the caribbean sea banded convection developed in the northwestern caribbean sea by junexc2xa011 though the system did not significantly organize after an upper trough moved east wind shear decreased causing lower atmospheric pressures observations in cozumel quintana roo mexico{2] it is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa014 while centered over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula about 78 miles (126xc2xa0km) southeast of mxc3xa9rida yucatxc3xa1n{3] the depression tracked eastward and entered the western caribbean sea on junexc2xa015{2] operationally the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa015{4] early on junexc2xa016 at 0000xc2xa0utc the depression strengthened into tropical storm agnes{3] however the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later{5]after becoming a tropical storm on junexc2xa016 agnes slowly curved northward and approached the yucatxc3xa1n channel{3] late on junexc2xa017 it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western cuba{6] however the storm remained offshore though it closely brushed the western tip of cuba at 1200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa018 agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern gulf of mexico{3] prematurely the national hurricane center operationally upgraded agnes to a hurricane at 0200xc2xa0utc on that day{7] upon becoming a hurricane agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure due to unfavorable conditions agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the gulf coast of the united states{2] shortly before 2200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa019 agnes made landfall near cape san blas florida with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh){8]remnants of agnes over northeastern united statesat 0000xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa020 only a few hours after moving inland agnes weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the floridaalabamageorgia stateline agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression while over georgia the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering south carolina{2] though the storm had not dissipated the national hurricane center issued its final bulletin on agnes at 1600xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa020{9] by early on junexc2xa021 a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area which resulted in baroclinic activity as a result agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa021 while centered over eastern north carolina{2] three hours later the national hurricane center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures and indicated that winds had reached gale-force winds and once again upgraded agnes to a tropical storm{10] by early on junexc2xa022 agnes emerged into the northwestern atlantic ocean where it continued to re-intensify at 1200xc2xa0utc agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of 977xc2xa0mbar (289xc2xa0inhg) as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft however maximum sustained winds were at only 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh){2]{3] late on junexc2xa022 agnes made its final landfall on long beach new york on long island with winds of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh){11]agnes began its long life as an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on junexc2xa022 the system looped across south-central pennsylvania on junexc2xa023 and then looped across southern ontario on junexc2xa025 it spawned a tornado in maniwaki ontario early that day which killed two and injured 11xc2xa0people the cyclone sped east-northeast reaching cape breton on junexc2xa027 before intensifying as it re-entered the north atlantic after moving as far north as the 61stxc2xa0parallel while crossing the 25thxc2xa0meridian west on the morning of junexc2xa029 agnes turned southeastward its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars (29xc2xa0inhg) towards 0000 utc on junexc2xa030 between julyxc2xa01 and julyxc2xa03 the long-lived system looped between ireland and iceland while weakening once more the system turned northeast strengthening one more time while accelerating across the hebrides on julyxc2xa04 through 5 a stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed agnes on julyxc2xa06 while finally located to the southeast of iceland{12]preparations{edit]by 2200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa017 the national weather service issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the straits of florida and the florida keys from key west to dry tortugas{13] on the following day at 1600xc2xa0utc another hurricane watch was put into effective from cedar key to pensacola in addition the gale warnings in the florida keys were extended to include areas from fort myers beach to clearwater{14] at 2200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa018 a hurricane warning became effective from st marks to panama city{15] the gale warnings which were in effect for the florida keys and fort myers beach to clearwater was discontinued at 1000xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa019{16] it is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the national hurricane center downgraded agnes to a tropical storm at 2200xc2xa0utc on junexc2xa020{8] two hours later all gale warnings along the west coast of florida were discontinued{17]impact{edit]death tolls by areaareadeathscanada2cuba7florida9north carolina2virginia13delaware1maryland19new jersey1new york24pennsylvania50total128united states{edit]see also: 1972 hurricane agnes tornado outbreakin the united states agnes affected 15xc2xa0states and the capital area of washington dc almost 110000xc2xa0houses were impacted by agnes 3351xc2xa0of which were destroyed in addition 5211xc2xa0mobile homes were either damaged or completely destroyed farm buildings and small businesses also suffered extensively with 2226 and 5842 structures experiencing major losses or were destroyed of the 128xc2xa0fatalities caused by agnes 119xc2xa0occurred in the united states all of the damage estimates associated with agnes were within the countryagnes was at the time the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states though it has since been surpassed by numerous other stormsflorida{edit]upon landfall agnes produced abnormally high tides along much of the florida coastline the highest tides reported were at cedar key reaching 7 feet (21xc2xa0m) above normal sea levels the second largest waves were 64 feet (20xc2xa0m) recorded at apalachicola in contrast few observations of high tides along the east coast of florida exist; the highest reported was 3 feet (091xc2xa0m) above average in jacksonville{2] in alligator point at least 16xc2xa0homes were swept off their foundations six bridges connecting cedar key to the mainland areas of florida were submerged in addition a bridge from coquina key to st petersburg was also underwater due to high tides{18] nearly the entire state of florida reported rainfall though it was usually in the light to moderate range among the highest amounts of precipitation recorded were 897 inches (228xc2xa0mm) in naples 843 inches (214xc2xa0mm) in big pine key 73 inches (190xc2xa0mm) in the everglades and 717 inches (182xc2xa0mm) in tallahassee{2] near okeechobee larger amounts of rainfall may have occurred though there were no specific observations in that vicinity{19]damage in key west florida from a tornado spawned by agnesthough agnes made landfall as a hurricane no reports of hurricane-force winds exist however several locations observed tropical storm force winds the highest sustained winds and gusts were 52 and 69xc2xa0mph (84 and 111xc2xa0kmh) both recorded at the kennedy space center other reports of at least tropical storm force sustained winds were at 39xc2xa0mph (63xc2xa0kmh) in crestview and jacksonville 42xc2xa0mph (68xc2xa0kmh) in flamingo 43xc2xa0mph (69xc2xa0kmh) in key west and two observations of 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) in panama city{2] throughout the state agnes spawned at least 15xc2xa0tornadoes while several tornadoes were operationally unconfirmed initially referred to as a "windstorm" one of those twisters destroyed 50xc2xa0mobile homes and a fishing camp in okeechobee as well as cause six fatalities another significant tornado occurred in cape canaveral which destroyed two homes and 30xc2xa0trailers; it also damaged 20xc2xa0houses and the port canaveral coast guard station overall more than 100xc2xa0people were left homeless and caused 23 injuries and over 500000 in damage the costliest tornado was also spawned in brevard county and it destroyed 44xc2xa0planes at the merritt island airport and an apartment building in addition several houses in a nearby subdivision were also damaged losses from this tornado are estimated at 3xc2xa0milliondue to a combination of high tides rainfall winds and tornadoes 96xc2xa0dwellings were destroyed while about 1802xc2xa0suffered damage to some degree the destruction of 177xc2xa0mobile homes was reported and 374xc2xa0others were significantly damaged furthermore 988xc2xa0small businesses in the state were either destroyed or had major damage{20] eight counties in florida reported at least 1xc2xa0million in damage including 121xc2xa0million in pinellas 71xc2xa0million in sarasota 41xc2xa0million in brevard 31xc2xa0million in pasco 2xc2xa0million in manatee 14xc2xa0million in wakulla and franklin 13xc2xa0million in monroe and 1xc2xa0million in losses in hillsborough counties{21] although the damage toll estimated by the national hurricane center was at 8243xc2xa0million{22] the national climatic data center noted that at least 39xc2xa0million in losses were reported{21] in addition nine fatalities were reported in florida{22]southeastern united states{edit]rainfall accumulations in association with hurricane agnesin the states immediately to the north of florida impact was relatively minor rainfall was generally light in georgia though peaking at 855 inches (217xc2xa0mm) in brunswick other locations that reported precipitations include 454 inches (115xc2xa0mm) in albany 395 inches (100xc2xa0mm) in savannah and 318 inches (81xc2xa0mm) in macon{2] during the tornado outbreak two of the tornadoes were spawned in georgia the tornado in pierce county caused 25000 in damage and one injury{23] losses were more significant from the twister in coffee county reaching 250000{24] one mobile home in georgia suffered significant damage though it is unknown if this was related to the tornadoes{20] though the damage from both tornadoes combined was about 275000{23]{24] the national hurricane center notes only 205000 in losses{22]in alabama tides up to 13 feet (040xc2xa0m) above normal were reported in the mobile bay area though rainfall only reached 393 inches (100xc2xa0mm) and 108 inches (27xc2xa0mm) in dothan and mobile{19] precipitation from the storm in the state of alabama peaked at 767 inches (195xc2xa0mm) in headland damage in the state was minor though low-lying streets in the gulf shores were flooded{25]in some areas of south carolina the storm dropped as much as 95 inches (240xc2xa0mm) of rain in less than 36xc2xa0hours as a result several rivers flooded along the pee dee river pastures small grains and soy bean crops near cheraw suffered major damage; similar effects occurred along the congaree river near columbia though damage was lesser in greenville damage to basements streets and water systems occurred after the reedy river overflowed{26] damage in south carolina was minor totaling to only 50000{22]effects were very minimal in tennessee and limited to light rainfall in the eastern portions of the state generally reaching no more than 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm){19] the highest amount of precipitation recorded was 459 inches (117xc2xa0mm) in unicoi{27]virginia{edit]buildings almost fully submerged in richmondin richmond four people drowned after their car plunged into the swollen james river{28] a train bound for washington dc stopped due to flooding in richmond which temporarily stranded 537 passengers{29] the peak creek in western virginia overflowed its banks flooding a low-income housing area of pulaski with water up to rooftops{30] at the height of the flooding over 600 miles (970xc2xa0km) of highways were submerged resulting in 148 million in damage to roads in the state severe damage also occurred to sewer and water facilities totaling to 345 million{31] 95 houses were destroyed and 4393 others were damaged while 125 mobile homes were destroyed and another were significantly affected additionally 205 small businesses were either damaged or destroyed the interstatexc2xa095 (i-95) purple heart bridge over northern virginia's occoquan river was severely damaged and closed when rammed by a large barge carried by floodwaters{32] in the washington dc virginia suburbs the lake barcroft dam was undermined and breached draining the entire lake previously the reservoir for alexandria va{33]overall flooding was described as "the worst in 50 years"{28] in virginia alone 13 fatalities and 1259 million in losses were reported{22]maryland{edit]in baltimore three children drowned when their mother's car was swept off a highway however the mother survived and was rescued by firemen using rowboats{34] in the state of maryland damage totaled to 110xc2xa0million and 19xc2xa0fatalities were reportedhardest hit was the patapsco river valley with widespread destruction of buildings roads and railroads in the state park at daniels including its mill{35] at ellicott city and oella the flooding was first reported in the early morning hours of june 22 and water was reported as high as 40 feet above normal{36] river road along the patapsco was almost completely washed out more than 900 people were evacuated from their homes national guard helicopters were used to rescue workmen from the roof of the danielsxe2x80x99 plant in elkridge a family of six was forced from their home and they attempted to reach high ground in a small boat it capsized and all six held onto the boat for several hours until it reached more shallow waterin howard county a total of 704 county residents were left homeless more than 80 homes in the ellicott city area were damaged and 72 homes in elkridge were affected in laurel the 9th street bridge crossing the patuxent river was washed away by flood waters in anne arundel county all roads linking the county with baltimore city or county were closed (including the baltimore beltway) as were all roads "near the patuxent river" including waysons corner where over 300 homes were evacuated{32] the patapsco flooded residential homes in parts of the county's north linthicum pumphrey and belle grove road brooklyn park neighborhoods{32]the gwynn oak amusement park closed after suffering severe damage from flooding when hurricane agnes caused gwynns falls to overflow in 1974 the park's rides were auctioned off the carousel was moved and is still in operation on the national mall in washington dca popular footbridge in the chesapeake and ohio canal national historical park which led across a branch of the potomac river to an overlook of great falls was washed away and not rebuilt until 1996{37]as a result of agnes' rains conowingo dam astride the susquehanna river just north of the chesapeake bay recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights{38] before the river crested the water came within feet of overtopping the dam as the dam's normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failurepennsylvania{edit]in pennsylvania heavy rainfall was reported with much of the state experiencing more than 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm) of precipitation furthermore a large swath of rainfall exceeding 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) was reported in the central part of the state overall the rains peaked at 19 inches (480xc2xa0mm) in the western portions of schuylkill county{19] as a result agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of pennsylvania overall more than 100000xc2xa0people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding some buildings were under 13 feet (40xc2xa0m) of water in harrisburg{39] at the governor's mansion the first floor was submerged by flood waters hundreds were trapped in their homes in wilkes-barre due to the overflowing susquehanna river at the historic cemetery in forty fort 2000xc2xa0caskets were washed away leaving body parts on porches roofs and in basements in luzerne county alone 25000xc2xa0homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed losses in that county totaled to 1xc2xa0billion{40] in chadds ford township in delaware county the brandywine creek crested at 165 feet (50xc2xa0m) sending flood waters into the city water poured into the first floor of an art museum in chadds ford township which threatened at least 25xc2xa0million in nc wyeth paintings though they were quickly moved to the upper floors along the allegheny river it was above flood stage in some low-lying areas during the height of the storm the river was rising at about 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm) per hour{39] in reading the schuylkill river reached a record flood of 315 feet hundreds of people were evacuated and over a hundred homes destroyed floods reached as far inland as 3rd street in the heart of the city{41]more than one hundred harrisburg ymca campers and staff were evacuated using two ch-47 chinook helicopters flown by the national guard at camp shikellimy located downstream of dehart dam in middle paxton township additionally 36xc2xa0girl scouts were rescued by state police while at a camp in york a bridge collapsed in danville which caused two diesel locomotives and several freight cars to fall into a swollen creek{29] in the state of pennsylvania more than 68000xc2xa0homes and 3000xc2xa0businesses were destroyed due to the destroyed houses at least 220000xc2xa0people were left homeless{40] the damage and death toll was the highest in pennsylvania with 50xc2xa0fatalities and 23xc2xa0billion in losses in that state aloneon june 26 1972 three news correspondents were killed in a helicopter crash in harrisburg where they had been covering the flooding the victims were del vaughn of cbs news and sid brenner and louis clark of wcau in philadelphia and the pilot mike sedio the helicopter lost its rotor some three hundred feet above the capital city airport crashed and exploded on the runway{42]new york{edit]olean elmira and corning as well as many other southern tier towns were severely flooded sections of the former erie railroad main line between hornell and binghamton were damaged flooding in the upper allegheny river basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the kinzua dam less than a decade prior; several towns in cattaraugus county suffered extensive road and bridge damage that four decades later has yet to be repaired with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them however said dam construction allegedly succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in pennsylvania and much of the flood-prone areas in the allegheny reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dam's constructionin elmira porches and garages were ripped loose the walnut st bridge was carried away maple ave to notre dame high school was "underwater" and on s main st gerould's pharmacy at w hudson was engulfed by 10xc2xa0feet 3xc2xa0inches (312xc2xa0m) of waterhornell's damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood both the arkport and almond dams saved hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities three us army corp of engineers were killed in hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over crosby creekthe height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the corning museum of glass showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 16 m above the floor causing substantial damage to the collection and archives parts of corning were under more than 3 m of flood waterswest virginia and ohio{edit]rainfall in west virginia was generally light though heavier in the eastern and northern panhandles of the state{19] precipitation peaked at 794 inches (202xc2xa0mm) in berkeley springs 108xc2xa0houses were destroyed and 1558xc2xa0others suffered damage furthermore 118xc2xa0mobile homes were destroyed and 91xc2xa0were significantly affected 10xc2xa0farm buildings reported major losses while 18xc2xa0small businesses were either damaged or destroyed{20] in the state of west virginia no fatalities were reported and damage was slightly more than 77xc2xa0million{22]although no reports of abnormally high winds or rainfall exists in ohio{2] the storm caused minor damage to about 302xc2xa0dwellings and severely affected at least three houses in addition at least 100xc2xa0mobile homes suffered major damage{20] northeasterly winds from the storm waves reaching a height of 15 feet (46xc2xa0m) along the shore of lake erie and also caused the water level to rise by 35 feet (11xc2xa0m) houses cars boats buildings ships and docks in the vicinity of lake erie were damaged{26] overall losses in ohio totaled to at least 4xc2xa0million{22]{26]elsewhere in the united states{edit]while approaching delaware agnes produced tides about 15 feet (046xc2xa0m) above normal at the indian river inlet high winds were also reported in the state and at the dover air force base a wind gust as high as 67xc2xa0mph (108xc2xa0kmh) was reported{2] rainfall was generally light peaking at 76 inches (190xc2xa0mm) in middletown{43] street flooding was reported and basements in low-lying area were flooded though damage in delaware was minimal{44] one fatality occurred in that state{2] in the washington dc area moderate rainfall was reported with precipitation amounts peaking at 1365 inches (347xc2xa0mm) at the washington dulles international airport{2] significant flooding occurred and it was described as the worst in at least 44xc2xa0years in the georgetown section waterfront streets along the potomac river were submerged in as much as 7 feet (21xc2xa0m) of water{45] the rock creek also overflowed its banks which sent about 10 feet (30xc2xa0m) of water onto the rock creek parkway as a result at least 100xc2xa0cars were abandoned and several motorists required rescuing by police{39] no national monuments were affected by flood waters{45] however about 350xc2xa0dwellings in washington dc suffered minor damage{20] at the white house reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floor{39]though the storm passed just west of some areas in new england minimal impact in that region of the united states in connecticut winds were well below tropical storm force although a wind gust of 46xc2xa0mph (74xc2xa0kmh) was reported in hartford rainfall in the state was light peaking at 162 inches (41xc2xa0mm) also recorded in hartford{2] along the coast of connecticut high tides and heavy rainfall flooded coastal roads and basements high tides occurred along the coastline of rhode island reaching 32 feet (098xc2xa0m) above normal in providence{2] in combination with rainfall and high tides some coastal roads were flooded strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in massachusetts causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state one home in great barrington was struck by a tree; a similar incident occurred in milford high winds in southern and eastern vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs which resulted in scattered power outages roads being blocked and minor property damage in mendon a tree fell on a house while two cars were damaged after being struck by limbs similar conditions occurred in new hampshire albeit effects were lesser{26]elsewhere{edit]as a precaution more than 8000xc2xa0people in western cuba including on isla de la juventud (isle of pines) were evacuated{46] in western cuba agnes dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 1676 inches (426xc2xa0mm) on isla de la juventud at cape san antonio the westernmost point in cuba precipitation reached 1532 inches (389xc2xa0mm){2] due to high winds and flooding at least 97xc2xa0houses were destroyed and another 270xc2xa0were damaged in the pinar del rxc3xado province the cities of guane and mantua were isolated by swollen rivers it was also reported that extensive crop damage occurred in low-lying areas{46] overall seven fatalities occurred in cuba though the damage toll is unknown{47] however some sources claim agnes caused 16xc2xa0fatalities and reported 24xc2xa0people missing{48]in canada hurricane agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern ontario and southern quebec causing numerous floodings around lake erie and lake ontario in the town of maniwaki quebec the storm toppled a mobile home killing two people{49]aftermath{edit]following the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared 14xc2xa0counties in florida as a disaster area including: brevard county dixie county franklin county hendry county hillsborough county lee county levy county manatee county monroe county okeechobee county pasco county pinellas county sarasota county and wakulla county{50] in panama city florida where over 25000xc2xa0tourists evacuated effects were not significant as a result the city lost millions of dollars from tourism which led the officials of panama city to file a 100xc2xa0million lawsuit against the national weather service officials in that city believed that the national weather service and other media outlets made "exaggerated and erroneous" forecasts and reports on the storm{51] 20xc2xa0of maryland's 24xc2xa0counties were declared a disaster areafollowing the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed:the erie lackawanna railway (el) estimated that damage between binghamton and salamanca new york amounted to 2 million el filed for chapter 77 bankruptcythe penn central railroad sustained nearly 20 million in damagesthe resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrail{citation needed]the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny reservoir to capacityretirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of extensive damage and severe death tolls the name "agnes" was retired
