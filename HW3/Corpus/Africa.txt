refer to the inhabitants of africa which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean (ancient libya){9]{10] this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe; see terence for discussion the name is usually connected with hebrew or phoenician xcaxbfafar 'dust' but a 1981 hypothesis{11] has asserted that it stems from the berber ifri (plural ifran) "cave" in reference to cave dwellers{12] the same word{12] may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania a berber tribe originally from yafran (also known as ifrane) in northwestern libya{13]under roman rule carthage became the capital of the province of africa proconsularis which also included the coastal part of modern libya{14] the latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (eg in celtica from celtae as used by julius caesar) the later muslim kingdom of ifriqiya located in modern-day tunisia also preserved a form of the nameaccording to the romans africa lay to the west of egypt while "asia" was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy (85xe2x80x93165 ad) indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of "africa" expanded with their knowledgeother etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "africa":the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus (ant 115) asserted that it was named for epher grandson of abraham according to gen 25:4 whose descendants he claimed had invaded libyaisidore of seville in his 7th-century etymologiae xiv52 suggests "africa comes from the latin aprica meaning "sunny"massey in 1881 stated that africa is derived from the egyptian af-rui-ka meaning "to turn toward the opening of the ka" the ka is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the ka" refers to a womb or birthplace africa would be for the egyptians "the birthplace"{15]michxc3xa8le fruyt in 1976 proposed{16] linking the latin word with africus "south wind" which would be of umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind"robert r stieglitz of rutgers university in 1984 proposed: "the name africa derived from the latin aphir-ic-a is cognate to hebrew ophir"{17]historymain article: history of africafurther information: history of north africa history of west africa history of central africa history of east africa and history of southern

considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human species originating from the continent{18]{19] during the mid-20th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (bp=before present) fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved

populated by groups of hunter-gatherers{22]{23]{24] these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50000 years bp exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea{25]{26] the strait of gibraltar in morocco{27] or the isthmus of suez in egypt{28]other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa southeast africa north africa and the sahara{29]the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions{30] at the end of the ice ages estimated to have been around 10500 bc the sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili n'ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia{31] however the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile around 3500 bc due to a tilt in the earth's orbit the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification{32] the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements a major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa since this time dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and increasingly during the last 200 years in ethiopiathe domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures it is speculated that by 6000 bc cattle were domesticated in north africa{33] in the sahara-nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubiaaround 4000 bc the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace{34] this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification this in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west africa{34]by the first millennium bc ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan africa{35] and by 500 bc metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries ad copper objects from egypt north africa nubia and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc have been excavated in west africa suggesting that trans-saharan trade networks had been established by this date{34]early civilizationsmain article: ancient african historycolossal statues of ramesses ii at abu simbel egypt date from around 1400 bcthe origins and spread of the bantu

and longest-lasting civilizations the egyptian state continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 bc{37]{38] egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day libya and nubia and according to martin bernal as far north as crete{39]an independent centre of civilization with trading links to phoenicia was established by phoenicians from tyre on the north-west african coast at carthage{40]{41]{42]european exploration of africa began with ancient greeks and romans{citation needed] in 332 bc alexander the great was welcomed as a liberator in persian-occupied egypt he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death{43]following the conquest of north africa's mediterranean coastline by the roman empire the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus born in leptis magna in present-day libyaxe2x80x94his mother was italian roman and his father was punic{44]christianity spread across these areas at an early date from judaea via egypt and beyond the borders of the roman world into nubia;{45] by ad 340 at the latest it had become the state religion of the aksumite empire syro-greek missionaries who arrived by way of the red sea were responsible for this theological development{46]in the early 7th century the newly formed arabian islamic caliphate expanded into egypt and then into north africa in a short while the local berber elite had been integrated into muslim arab tribes when the umayyad capital damascus fell in the 8th century the islamic centre of the mediterranean shifted from syria to qayrawan in north africa islamic north africa had become diverse and a hub for mystics scholars jurists and philosophers during the above-mentioned period islam spread to sub-saharan africa mainly through trade routes and migration{47]ninth to eighteenth centuriesafrican horseman of baguirmi in full padded armour suitthe intricate 9th-century bronzes from igbo-ukwu in nigeria displayed a level of technical

by many different sorts of political organization and rule these included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the san people of southern africa; larger more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the bantu-speaking peoples of central southern and eastern africa; heavily structured clan groups in the horn of africa; the large sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the akan; edo yoruba and igbo people in west africa; and the swahili coastal trading towns of southeast africaby the ninth century ad a string of dynastic states including the earliest hausa states stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central sudan the most powerful of these states were ghana gao and the kanem-bornu empire ghana declined in the eleventh century but was succeeded by the mali empire which consolidated much of western sudan in the thirteenth century kanem accepted islam in the eleventh centuryin the forested regions of the west african coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes found at the town of igbo-ukwu the bronzes have been dated

city-states and kingdoms; the fon kingdom of dahomey was one of the non-yoruba domains under oyo controlthe almoravids were a berber dynasty from the sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the eleventh century{51] the banu hilal and banu ma'qil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers where the locals were arabized{52] and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of islam{53]ruins of great zimbabwe (flourished eleventh to fifteenth centuries)following the breakup of mali a local leader named sonni ali

1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries{61]in west africa the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities the gradual decline of slave-trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america and the british royal navy's increasing presence off the west african coast obliged african states to adopt new economies between 1808 and 1860 the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1600 slave ships and freed 150000 africans who were aboard{62]slave being inspected from captain canot; or twenty years of an african slaveraction was also taken against african leaders

that were drawn during the era of european colonialism since colonialism african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule however few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis and many have instead cycled through a series of coups producing military dictatorshipsgreat instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups and graft under these leaders for political gain many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts some of which had been exacerbated or even created by colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential

role in instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states france or both the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned

claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse{67]{68]{69] the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 55 million people{70] since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800000 people were murdered aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issuein the 21st century however the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined for instance the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations mainly from china{71] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline several african economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016 a significant part of this growth which is sometimes referred to as africa rising can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone{72]geographymain article: geography of

central planning high levels of illiteracy lack of access to foreign capital and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide){86] according to the united nations' human development report in 2003 the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all african{87]poverty illiteracy malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation as well as poor health affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent in august 2008 the world bank{88] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of 125 per day (versus the previous measure of 100) 805 of the sub-saharan africa population was living on less than 250 (ppp) per day in 2005 compared with 857 for india{89]sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty (125 per day); some 50 of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people) a figure that rose to 58 in 1996 before dropping to 50 in 2005 (380 million people) the average poor person in sub-saharan africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973{90] indicating increasing poverty in some areas some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors{91]{92]{93]from 1995 to 2005 africa's rate of economic growth increased averaging 5 in 2005 some countries experienced still higher growth rates notably angola sudan and equatorial guinea all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity the continent is believed to hold 90 of the world's cobalt 90 of its platinum 50 of its gold 98 of its chromium 70 of its tantalite{94] 64 of its manganese and one-third of its uranium{95] the democratic republic of the congo (drc) has 70 of the world's coltan a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones the drc also has more than 30 of the world's diamond reserves{96] guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite{97] as the growth in africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels in fact the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity{98]in recent years the people's republic of china has built increasingly stronger ties with african nations and is africa's largest trading partner in 2007 chinese companies invested a total of us1 billion in africa{71]a harvard university study led by professor calestous juma showed that africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency "african agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured africa's export of raw materials and importation of food africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity"{99]during us president barack obama's visit to africa in july 2013 he announced a us7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with african heads of state he also announced a new programme named trade africa designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between africa and the us{100]demographicsmain article: demographics of africawoman from beninafrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years and consequently it is relatively young in some african states more than half the population is under 25 years of age{101] the total number of people in africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990{102] as of 2016 the population of africa is estimated at 12 billion{1] africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; african population surpassed europe in the 1990s while the americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population at roughly the same time - india and china's 14 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022{103]san bushman man from

over most of sub-saharan africa{104] but there are also several nilotic groups in south sudan and east africa the mixed swahili people on the swahili coast and a few remaining indigenous khoisan ("san" or "bushmen") and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa respectively bantu-speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea and are found in parts of southern cameroon in the kalahari desert of southern africa the distinct people known as the bushmen (also "san" closely related to but distinct from "hottentots") have long been present the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa pygmies are the pre-bantu indigenous peoples of central africa{105]the peoples of west africa primarily speak nigerxe2x80x93congo

of three main indigenous groups: berbers in the northwest egyptians in the northeast and nilo-saharan-speaking peoples in the east the arabs who arrived in the 7th century ad introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians (who founded carthage) and hyksos the indo-iranian alans the indo- european greeks romans and vandals settled in north africa as well significant berber communities remain within morocco and algeria in the 21st century while to a lesser extent berber speakers are also present in some regions of tunisia and libya{106] the berber-speaking tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa in mauritania there is a small but near-extinct berber community in the north and nigerxe2x80x93congo-speaking peoples in the south though in both regions arabic and arab culture predominates in sudan although arabic and arab culture predominate it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke nilo-saharan such as the nubians fur masalit and zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the arabian peninsula small communities of afro-asiatic-speaking beja nomads can also be found in egypt and sudan{citation needed]beja bedouins from northeast africain the horn of africa some ethiopian and eritrean groups (like the amhara and

afro-asiaticprior to the decolonization movements of the post-world war ii era europeans were represented in every part of africa{107] decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers xe2x80x93 especially from algeria and morocco (16 million pieds-noirs in north africa){108] kenya congo{109] rhodesia mozambique and angola{110] between 1975 and 1977 over a million colonials returned to portugal alone{111] nevertheless white africans remain an important minority in many african states particularly zimbabwe namibia rxc3xa9union and the republic of south africa{112] the country with the largest white african population is south africa{113] dutch and british diasporas represent the largest communities of european ancestry on the continent today{114]european colonization also brought sizable groups of asians particularly from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and southeast african countries the large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in 1972 though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents) during the 20th century small but economically important communities of lebanese and chinese{71] have also developed in the larger coastal

years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes for example african customs were discouraged and african languages were prohibited in mission schools{118] leopold ii of belgium attempted to "civilize" africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft{118]obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art{119] according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m cole "the precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art" {120] fraser and cole assert that in igboland some art objects "lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions{120] author chika okeke-agulu states that "the racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art" {121] in soweto the west rand administrative board established a cultural section to collect read and review scripts before performances could occur{122] editors f abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the "traumatic encounter between africa and europe" {123] on the other hand mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music dance spirituality and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies" {124]there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures under such movements as the african renaissance led by thabo mbeki afrocentrism led by a group of
