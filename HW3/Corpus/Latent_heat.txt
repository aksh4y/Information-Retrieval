waalswaterstonbook:thermodynamicsvtelatent heat is thermal energy released or absorbed by a body or a thermodynamic system during a constant-temperature process - usually a first-order phase transitionlatent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature examples are latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization involved in phase changes ie a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure{1]{2]the term was introduced around 1762 by british chemist joseph black it is derived from the latin latere (to lie hidden) black used the term in the context of calorimetry where a heat transfer caused a volume change while the thermodynamic system's temperature was constantin contrast to latent heat sensible heat involves an energy transfer that results in a temperature change of the systemcontents1 usage11 meteorology2 history3 specific latent heat4 table of specific latent heats5 specific latent heat for condensation of water - in clouds6 variation with temperature (or pressure)7 see also8 referencesusage{edit]the terms xe2x80xb3sensible heatxe2x80xb3 and xe2x80xb3latent heatxe2x80xb3 are specific forms of energy; they are two properties of a material or in a thermodynamic system xe2x80xb3sensible heatxe2x80xb3 is a body's internal energy that may be xe2x80xb3sensedxe2x80xb3 or felt xe2x80xb3latent heatxe2x80xb3 is internal energy concerning the phase ( solid  liquid  gas ) of a material and does not affect the temperatureboth sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transport of energy in nature changes of latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric water vaporization and condensation whereas sensible heat is energy that reflects the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean or icethe original usage of the term as introduced by black was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature such usage referred to latent heat of expansion and several other related latent heats these latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics{3]when a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example it may expand by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to volume or latent heat of expansion or increase its pressure by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to pressure{4] latent heat is energy released or absorbed by a body or a thermodynamic system during a constant-temperature process two common forms of latent heat are latent heat of fusion (melting) and latent heat of vaporization (boiling) these names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid and liquid to gasin both cases the change is endothermic meaning that the system absorbs energy for example when water evaporates energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energyif the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's sensible heat onto the surfacethe large value of the enthalpy of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water and is more hazardousmeteorology{edit]in meteorology latent heat flux is the flux of heat from the earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or transpiration of water at the surface and subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere it is an important component of earth's surface energy budget latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the bowen ratio technique or more recently since the mid-1900s by the jonathan beaver methodhistory{edit]the english word latent comes from latin latxc4x93ns meaning lying hidden{5]{6] the term latent heat was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when joseph black commissioned by producers of scotch whisky in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process{7] to studying system changes such as of volume and pressure when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath james prescott joule characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles ie a form of potential energy and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer{8] relating the latter to thermal energyspecific latent heat{edit]a specific latent heat (l) expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (q) required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (m) usually 1kg of a substance as an intensive property:l=qm{displaystyle l={frac {q}{m}}}intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substancesfrom this definition the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated byq=ml{displaystyle q={m}{l}}where:q is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in kj or in btu)m is the mass of the substance (in kg or in lb) andl is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (kj kgxe2x88x921 or in btu lbxe2x88x921) either lf for fusion or lv for vaporizationtable of specific latent heats{edit]the following table shows the specific latent heats and change of phase temperatures (at standard pressure) of some common fluids
