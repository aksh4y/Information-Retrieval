a thirty-minute period of calm was reported it continued across the delaware bay and later passed over cape may new jersey where a fifteen-minute calm was reported{6] modern researchers estimate it was a categoryxc2xa03 or categoryxc2xa04 hurricane upon striking new jersey one of the few hurricanes to hit the state{7]{8] moving ashore at very low tide{2] it paralleled the state's coastline just inland and after exiting into lower new york bay the hurricane made landfall on new york city at around 1930xc2xa0utc on september 3; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city{1] a minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of new york city{9] one modern researcher estimates the hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35xc2xa0mph (55xc2xa0kmh) and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965xc2xa0mbar{1] the hurricane continued northeastward through new england and after entering massachusetts on september 4 its exact path was unknown;{10] one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern maine{5] while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of maine{11]based on the arrangement of effects in new england meteorologist william c redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the winds were believed to be in a straight line{11]impact{edit]the continuous cataracts of rain swept impetuously along darkening the expanse of vision and apparently confounding the heaven earth and seas in a general chaosthe norfolk herald{5]in north carolina a powerful storm surge flooded large portions of portsmouth island; residents estimated the island would have been completely under water had the worst of the storm lasted for two more hours strong winds occurred across eastern north carolina resulting in at least 76xc2xa0destroyed houses numerous people were killed in currituck{6]the strongest winds of the hurricane lasted for about an hour in southeastern virginia after which the storm rapidly abated several houses were completely destroyed with many others receiving moderate to severe damage the winds destroyed most of the roof of the courthouse and uprooted trees across the region; fallen tree limbs damaged a stone bridge in norfolk the hurricane produced a strong storm surge along the virginia coastline which reached 10xc2xa0feet (3xc2xa0m) at pungoteague on the delmarva peninsula the storm surge which reached several hundred yards inland destroyed two bridges and flooded many warehouses along the elizabeth river rough waves grounded the uss guerriere and the uss congress and also destroyed several schooners and brigs along the eastern shore the storm surge flooded barrier islands along the atlantic coastline causing severe crop damage and downing many trees several houses were destroyed and at pungoteague the impact of the hurricane was described as "unexampled destruction"; five people drowned in chincoteague considered one of the most violent hurricanes on record in the mid-atlantic the hurricane caused 200000 in damage in virginia (1821xc2xa0usd 31xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd){5]gale force winds affected the delmarva peninsula; on poplar island in talbot county maryland winds peaked at 1600xc2xa0utc on september 3{6] the strongest winds were confined to the atlantic coastline with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in washington dc and baltimore maryland{12] fierce winds were observed in cape henlopen delaware with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area{6]upon making landfall on cape may new jersey the cyclone produced a 5xc2xa0foot (15xc2xa0m) storm surge on the delaware bay side of the city{12] lasting for several hours the hurricane-force winds were described as "{blowing] with great violence"{6] causing widespread devastation across the region in little egg harbor its passage caused damage to the port strong winds reached as far inland as philadelphia pennsylvania where winds of over 40xc2xa0mph (60xc2xa0kmh) downed trees and chimneys; in the city precipitation accrued to 392xc2xa0inches (996xc2xa0mm) further to the north the hurricane destroyed a windmill at bergen point new jersey{12] though the hurricane struck at low tide it produced a storm surge of over 29xc2xa0feet (9xc2xa0m) along several portions of the new jersey coastline causing significant overwash{2]the hurricane produced a storm surge of 13xc2xa0feet (4xc2xa0m) in only one hour at battery park a record only broken 191 years later by hurricane sandy manhattan island was completely flooded to canal street; one hurricane researcher remarked that the storm surge flooding would have been much worse had the hurricane not struck at low tide{13] however few deaths were reported in the city since the flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today{14] the hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed new york city though strong winds left severe damage across the city high tides occurred along the hudson river strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along long island one ship sank killing 17xc2xa0people along long island the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed{12]in new england the hurricane produced widespread gale force winds with damage greatest in connecticut{10] the black rock harbor light in black rock connecticut was destroyed on september 21{12]{15] elsewhere in the state the winds damaged or destroyed churches houses and small buildings moderate crop damage to fruit was reported as well strong winds extended into eastern massachusetts though little damage was reported in the boston area{10]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of north carolina hurricanes (pre-1900)list of new jersey hurricaneslist of new york hurricaneslist of new england hurricaneslist of delaware hurricanesreferences{edit]historical sketches of the town of warner new hampshire (1832)^ a b c fp ho "the norfolk and long island hurricane - sept 3-4 - pt 2" (pdf) retrieved 2007-07-02xc2xa0^ a b c donnelly jeffrey p;
