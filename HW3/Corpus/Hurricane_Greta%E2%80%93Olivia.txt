however damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared in honduras about 1200xc2xa0homes were damaged about half of which in towns along the coastline the storm damaged about 75 of the houses on roatxc3xa1n along the offshore bay islands and there was one death in the country in the belize barrier reef greta downed trees and produced high waves while on the mainland there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge in dangriga where it made landfall the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125xc2xa0houses and the primary hospital in belize city a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses damage in belize was estimated at 25xc2xa0million (1978xc2xa0usd) and there were four deathscontents1 meteorological history2 impact3 aftermath4 see also5 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave exited the west coast of africa near dakar senegal on septemberxc2xa07 moving westward across the atlantic ocean the wave spawned an area of convection three days later which gradually organized on septemberxc2xa013 the wave moved through the windward islands producing wind gusts of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) on barbados later that day it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75xc2xa0mi (120xc2xa0km) west-northwest of trinidad based on ship and land reports though located in a climatologically unfavorable area the depression intensified and continued to develop a hurricane hunters flight on septemberxc2xa014 indicated that the depression intensified into tropical storm greta to the north of the netherlands antilles{1]after becoming a tropical storm greta intensified slowly due to a strong trough to the northwest{1] and with the south american coastline located to the south the southerly inflow was disrupted{2] with a ridge to the north along the 30th parallel the storm moved quickly west-northwestward across the caribbean{3] on septemberxc2xa016 greta intensified into a hurricane about 275xc2xa0mi (443xc2xa0km) south of jamaica{1] shortly thereafter the trough to the northwest weakened which had been preventing the storm's intensification{1] an increasingly well-defined eye developed while approaching the coast of honduras as the barometric pressure quickly dropped{4] early on septemberxc2xa018 the eyewall passed just offshore cabo gracias a dios the sparsely populated border between honduras and nicaragua{4]{5] the nhc described the eye as having "literally ricocheted off of the protruding northeast coast of honduras" thus sparing much of the country from the strongest winds at 0710xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa018 the hurricane hunters observed a minimum pressure of 947xc2xa0mbar (280xc2xa0inhg) just off the northern honduras coast which was the basis for the estimated peak intensity of 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh){4] this made it a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale{6]satellite image of hurricane olivia in the eastern pacificdespite the proximity to land greta initially maintained a well-defined structure the hurricane continued generally west-northwestward due to the ridge to the north and initially was expected to enter the bay of campeche{7] after passing through the bay islands off northern honduras{5] greta weakened slightly while approaching belize and made landfall near dangriga at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa019{4] with winds of about 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh){6] the calm of the eye was reported for three to five minutes there{8] rapidly weakening over land the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over guatemala within 12xc2xa0hours of landfall a large high pressure area from the carolinas to the central gulf of mexico turned greta southwestward toward the eastern pacific ocean{9] at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa020 the eastern pacific hurricane center (ephc) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while greta was 30xc2xa0mi (50xc2xa0km) from the coast soon after the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern pacific and re-intensified at 0600xc2xa0utc the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named olivia by the ephc after initially moving to the north olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop based on observations from nearby ships and radar it is estimated olivia attained hurricane status early on septemberxc2xa022 while tracking towards the mexican coastline the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 1900 and 2000xc2xa0utc olivia made landfall about 60xc2xa0mi (95xc2xa0km) east of salina cruz early on septemberxc2xa023 olivia dissipated over the mexican state of chiapas{10]hurricane gretaxe2x80x93olivia was a rare crossover storm from the atlantic to the pacific one of ten named storms to maintain tropical cyclone status during the crossing{6]{11]impact{edit]image of hurricane greta north of hondurasearly in its duration greta produced heavy rainfall in the netherlands antilles but the strongest winds remained north of the island{1]late on septemberxc2xa017 when greta's eye was just offshore honduras the country's government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern coastline around the same time the mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{12] and on septemberxc2xa018 a hurricane warning was issued for the belize and guatemala coastlines{13] these advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities{9] in puerto castilla honduras about 2000xc2xa0people were evacuated in advance of the storm{14] the honduran government put its military police and red cross on standby in advance of the storm due to fears of a repeat of hurricane fifi in 1974{15] however unlike fifi which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track greta did not cause as significant river flooding in honduras{4]{5]across much of greta's track in central america the hurricane dropped locally heavy rainfall{9] when greta passed just offshore northeastern honduras it produced sustained winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) in puerto lempira with gusts to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) winds along the northern honduras coast were diminished due to the eyewall passing to the north{4] in honduras meteorologists estimated that upwards of 15xc2xa0in (380xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in mountainous regions many villages were isolated and communication with them was severely hampered{16] in puerto lempira roughly 1500 of the town's 7000 residents sought refuge in five large structures during the storm{17] in twelve communities along the coastline military officials reported that 656 homes were destroyed of which 278 were in punta potuca{18] in the offshore bay islands the hurricane destroyed 26xc2xa0houses on guanaja where many roofs were lost and several boats were destroyed on nearby roatxc3xa1n about 75 of the houses lost their roofs after experiencing wind gusts of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh){19] there was one death in honduras{9] and nationwide the hurricane damaged about 1200xc2xa0homes washed out roads and bridges and wrecked coconut and rice crops{20]at greta's final landfall in belize the highest sustained winds were 55xc2xa0mph (89xc2xa0kmh) in belize city{9] with gusts to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) at dangriga near the landfall location{21] on the offshore ambergris caye winds reached 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) and there was heavy rainfall{22] on half moon caye the hurricane damaged the base of a lighthouse and knocked over several coconut trees{23] along the belize barrier reef the hurricane downed palm trees and produced high waves with significant wave heights of about 33xc2xa0ft (10xc2xa0m) along carrie bow caye{24] on the mainland storm tides in dangriga were 6 to 7xc2xa0ft (18 to 21xc2xa0m) above normal which did not cause much flooding{9] the strong winds destroyed 50xc2xa0houses there and unroofed a further 75{8] including damage to the hospital there were also disruptions to power and water service about 90 of the grapefruit crop was destroyed and 50 of the orange crop was lost{25] tides were 2 to 4xc2xa0ft (061 to 122xc2xa0m) above normal in belize city{9] which caused flooding in conjunction with swollen rivers{25] the united states embassy was flooded with about one foot of mud{26] there was little damage in the city{25] although a tornado in belize city that damaged four houses and flipped over a truck{27] during the storm the belize international airport was closed{28] farther inland strong winds caused heavy damage at guanacaste national park{23] damage throughout belize was estimated at 25xc2xa0million (1978xc2xa0usd) and there were four deaths{9] three of the deaths were on offshore islands in areas without radios and the other was due to electrocution{29]aftermath{edit]following the storm damage in honduras the country requested help from the united states the tactical air command had sent two squadrons to central america in the middle of 1978 and in response to the request from honduras two aircraft delivered over 100000xc2xa0lb (45000xc2xa0kg) of cots water and generators; the units also deployed a 13xe2x80x93person crew who specialized in disaster relief the aid was distributed by the military of honduras{20]in late october 1978 the united methodist church sent books and other supplies via aircraft to belize after a youth group rode out the storm there and desired to help residents{30] despite the hurricane damage the economy of belize continued to grow after greta struck including an increase in banana production{31]although the national hurricane center does not consider it retired{32] the world meteorological organization lists greta in its retired hurricane name list{33]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms named gretaother storms named olivialist of atlanticxe2x80x93pacific crossover hurricaneshurricane edith (1971) - another hurricane that rapidly intensified while approaching cape gracias a dioshurricane fifi-orlene - hurricane in 1974 that caused catastrophic flooding in honduras before crossing into the pacific and regenerating into a hurricanereferences{edit]^ a b c d e hurricane greta and hurricane olivia preliminary report (jpg) (report) national hurricane center pxc2xa01 retrieved 2013-12-17xc2xa0^ john hope (1978-09-14) tropical cyclone discussion tropical storm greta (jpg) (report) national hurricane center retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ paul hebert (1978-09-15) tropical cyclone discussion tropical storm greta (jpg) (report) national hurricane center retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ a b c d e f hurricane greta and hurricane olivia preliminary report (jpg) (report) national hurricane center pxc2xa02 retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ a b c miles b lawrence (january 1978) "north atlantic tropical cyclones 1978" climatological data: national summary 29 retrieved 2013-12-26xc2xa0^ a b c national hurricane center (2013-06-18) atlantic hurricane best track (hurdat version 2) (txt) (report) national oceanic and atmospheric administration retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ john hope (1978-09-20) tropical cyclone discussion hurricane greta (jpg) (report) national hurricane center retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ a b alvin (1978-09-19) hwdamage (jpg) (report) national hurricane center retrieved 2013-12-23xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h hurricane greta and hurricane olivia preliminary report (jpg) (report) national hurricane center pxc2xa03 retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ emil b gunther eastern pacific hurricane center (july 1979) "eastern north pacific tropical cyclones of 1978" (pdf) monthly weather review american meteorological society: 925xe2x80x93926 bibcode:1979mwrv107911g doi:1011751520-0493(1979)107<0911:enptco>20co;2 retrieved 2013-12-20xc2xa0^ stephen caparotta;
