national oceanic and atmospheric administration's (noaa) office of oceanic and atmospheric research (oar) located in miami florida aoml's research spans tropical cyclone and hurricanes coastal ecosystems oceans and human health climate studies global carbon systems and ocean observations it is one of seven noaa research laboratories (rls){1]aomlxe2x80x99s organizational structure consists of an office of the director and three scientific research divisions the office of the director oversees the laboratoryxe2x80x99s scientific programs as well as its financial administrative computer outreacheducation and facility management services research programs are augmented by the cooperative institute for marine and atmospheric studies (cimas) a joint enterprise with the university of miamixe2x80x99s rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science cimas enables aoml and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientiststhe laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on virginia key in miami florida approximately 150m per year is invested in marine science and education among the university of miami's rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science noaa's southeast fisheries science center the miami seaquarium the

references4 external linkshistory{edit]the deeper roots of aoml can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the us coast survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of professor alexander dallas bache great grandson of benjamin franklin and a preeminent us science figure of the age in subsequent decades the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce a task increased by the acquisition of alaska hawaii and other island territories came to require all the resources of the coast surveythe modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s in early 1966 an institute for oceanography was created primarily from research groups of the then us coast and geodetic survey of the environmental science services administration (essa forerunner of noaa) the following year the institute was relocated to miami for a variety of reasons including the presence already in miami of meteorological research groups of essa dedicated to hurricane research and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather researchall of these groups were reorganized as the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratories (aoml) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on virginia keyemphasis at aoml continues to be on making and interpreting observations of the ocean and atmosphere from ships buoys and research aircraft the motivation and objectives of our research is continually evolving however in the beginning study of the geology geophysics and sedimentation of the sea floor was the largest activity of the laboratory but it has diminished to a smaller part of ecosystem research research in response to concerns for marine environmental quality and large-scale physics and chemistry of the oceans related to climate variation and global change have supplemented the original themes research into the nature and mechanisms of hurricanes has been and is also expected to continue as a major theme in view of the importance of this natural hazard to the atlantic and gulf coasts of the united statesnew projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations outreach via electronic communication is enabling aoml to serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observationsresearch{edit]aoml conducts mission oriented scientific research that seeks to understand the physical chemical and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere both separately and as a coupled system the laboratoryxe2x80x99s research themes (oceans and climate coastal ecosystems and hurricanes and tropical meteorology) employ a cross-disciplinary approach conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions more information about aoml's research can be found at  and its link to extreme weather and climate{edit]aoml carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties and on the role of the ocean in climate extreme weather events and ecosystems the tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches ( manages leads or participate in the design implementation maintenance and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and with these and other data conducts research in several areas including:meridional overturning circulationtropical

oceanographic instrumentationcoastal ecosystems{edit]coastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of aoml activities for more than two decades current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical biological and chemical studies supporting the south florida ecosystem restoration (sfer) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional intra-americas sea program
