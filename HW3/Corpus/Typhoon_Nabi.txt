pacific typhoon season nabi formed on augustxc2xa029 to the east of the northern mariana islands it moved westward and passed about 55xc2xa0km (35xc2xa0mi) north of saipan on augustxc2xa031 as an intensifying typhoon on the next day the joint typhoon warning center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status with winds equivalent to that of a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the japan meteorological agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175xc2xa0kmh (110xc2xa0mph) on septemberxc2xa02 nabi weakened while curving to the north striking the japanese island of kyushu on septemberxc2xa06 after brushing south korea the storm turned to the northeast passing over hokkaido before becoming extratropical on septemberxc2xa08the typhoon first affected the northern marianas islands where it left us25xc2xa0million in damage{nb 1] while damaging or destroying 114xc2xa0homes the damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the united states government while passing near okinawa nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage later the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in busan south korea and throughout the country nabi killed six people and caused us1154xc2xa0million in damage about 250000xc2xa0people evacuated along the japanese island of kyushu ahead of the storm and there were disruptions to train ferry and airline services in kyushu the storm left xc2xa5408xc2xa0billion{nb 2] (us369xc2xa0million) in crop damage after dropping 1322xc2xa0mm (520xc2xa0in) of rain over three days during the storm's passage there were 61xc2xa0daily rainfall records broken by nabi's precipitation the rains caused flooding and landslides forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close across japan nabi killed 29xc2xa0people and caused xc2xa5949xc2xa0billion (us854xc2xa0million) in damage soldiers local governments and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm

linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon augustxc2xa028 a large area of convection persisted about 1035xc2xa0km (645xc2xa0mi) east of guam located within an area of moderate wind shear the system quickly organized while moving westward its track influenced by a ridge to the north{2] at 00:00xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa029 a tropical depression formed from the system{3] classified by the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc){nb 3] as tropical depression 14w in initial forecasts the agency anticipated steady strengthening{5] due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area{6] at 12:00xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa029 the japan meteorological agency (jma){nb 4] upgraded it to a tropical storm{7] as such the jma named the storm nabi{nb 5]{2] about 12xc2xa0hours later the jma upgraded nabi further to a severe tropical storm{3] after the convection organized into spiral rainbands{6] at 18:00xc2xa0utc nabi intensified to typhoon status reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph){3]on augustxc2xa031 nabi passed about 55xc2xa0km (35xc2xa0mi) north-northeast of saipan in the northern mariana islands during its closest approach{8] the typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest on septemberxc2xa01 the jtwc upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260xc2xa0kmh (160xc2xa0mph); this is the equivalent of a categoryxc2xa05 on the saffir-simpson scale by contrast the jma estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175xc2xa0kmh (110xc2xa0mph) on septemberxc2xa02 with a barometric pressure of 925xc2xa0mbar (273xc2xa0inhg){2]{3] while at peak intensity the typhoon developed a large 95xc2xa0km (60xc2xa0mi) wide eye{9] for about 36xc2xa0hours nabi maintained its peak winds during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of pagasa;{2]{3] the philippine-based agency gave it the local name "jolina" although the storm remained away from the country{2]typhoon nabi on september 3 2005 as seen from the international space stationon septemberxc2xa03 nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge{2] later that day the winds leveled off at 155xc2xa0kmh (100xc2xa0mph) according to the jma on septemberxc2xa05 nabi passed near kitadaitxc5x8djima and yakushima part of the daitxc5x8d and xc5x8csumi island groups offshore southern japan{7] around that time the jtwc estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215xc2xa0kmh (130xc2xa0mph){3] after turning due north nabi made landfall near isahaya nagasaki around 05:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa06 after passing through the amakusa of kumamoto{10] shortly thereafter the storm entered the sea of japan{7] the typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow influenced by a low over the kamchatka peninsula{11] at 18:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa06 the jtwc discontinued advisories on nabi declaring it extratropical{12] although the jma continued tracking the storm on the next day nabi moved across northern hokkaido into the sea of okhotsk the jma declared the storm as extratropical on septemberxc2xa08 which continued eastward until dissipating on septemberxc2xa010 south of the aleutian islands{7] the remnants of nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern alaska on septemberxc2xa012{13]preparations{edit]typhoon nabi making landfall in kyushu on september 6after nabi formed as a tropical depression on augustxc2xa029 the local national weather service office on guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands tinian rota sapian and agrihan{14] on augustxc2xa030 the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for rota and agrihan while a typhoon warning was issued for tinian and saipan{15] on all four islands a condition of readiness 1 was declared the government of the northern mariana islands advised tinian and saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate and several schools operated as shelters{16] about 700xc2xa0people evacuated on saipan{17] and the airport was closed stranding about 1000xc2xa0travelers{18] as a precaution schools were closed on guam on augustxc2xa031 after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior the island's governor felix perez camacho also declared a condition of readiness 2{16] as well as a state of emergency{19] due to the typhoon several flights were canceled or delayed at antonio b won pat international airport on guam{20]ahead of the storm united states forces japan evacuated planes from okinawa to either guam or mainland japan to prevent damage{21] officials at the military bases on okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm's passage while nabi was turning to the north the island was placed under a condition of readiness 2{22] at the military base in sasebo ships also evacuated{23] and several buildings were closed after a condition of readiness 1 was declared{24]flood warnings posted along the shimanto river in advance of nabi in japanin kyushu officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of typhoon nabi affecting japan{25] these continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides the first order during the storm took place in the arita district in miyazaki city 21483xc2xa0households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river another 10000xc2xa0residences were vacated in nobeoka following similar reports{26] the entirety of the west japan railway company was shut down{2] canceled train services affected 77800xc2xa0people on

second-largest refinery idemitsu kosan stopped shipments to other refineries across the area and japan's largest refinery nippon oil stopped all sea shipments the cosmo oil company japan's fourth largest refinery stopped all shipments to yokkaichi and sakaide refineries{29] about 700xc2xa0schools in the country were closed approximately 1500xc2xa0soldiers were dispatched to tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for typhoon nabi's arrival and to clean up after the storm{30] officials in the miyazaki prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area{26]in south korea the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast prompting the airport at pohang to close{31] and forcing 162xc2xa0flights to be canceled{32] ferry service was also disrupted{32] and thousands of boats returned to port{33] the storm also prompted 138xc2xa0schools to close in the region{32] earlier the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon rusa in 2002 or maemi in 2003 both of which were devastating storms in south korea{34] officials in the russian far east issued a storm warning for vladivostok advising boats to remain at port{35]impact{edit]while passing between saipan and the volcanic island of anatahan nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the northern mariana islands saipan international airport reported sustained winds of 95xc2xa0kmh (59xc2xa0mph) with gusts to 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph) also on the island nabi produced 173xc2xa0mm (682xc2xa0in) of rainfall the storm destroyed two
