patricia was the second-most intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide behind typhoon tip in 1979 with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2575xc2xa0inhg){1] originating from a sprawling disturbance near the gulf of tehuantepec south of mexico in mid-octoberxc2xa02015 patricia was first classified a tropical depression on octoberxc2xa020 initial development was slow with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification the system later became a tropical storm and was named patricia the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on octoberxc2xa022 a well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and patricia grew from a tropical storm to a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane in just 24xc2xa0hoursxe2x80x94a near-record pace on octoberxc2xa023 the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215xc2xa0mph (345xc2xa0kmh){nb 1]{nb 2] this made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the western hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained windslate on octoberxc2xa023 dramatic weakening ensued and patricia made landfall near cuixmala jalisco with winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) this made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the pacific coast of mexico patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly faster than it had intensified as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of mexico within 24xc2xa0hours of moving ashore patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on octoberxc2xa024the precursor to patricia produced widespread flooding rains in central america hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm mostly in guatemala at least six fatalities were attributed to the event: four in el salvador one in guatemala and one in nicaragua torrential rains extended into southeastern mexico with areas of quintana roo and veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of 197xc2xa0in (500xc2xa0mm) damage in chetumal reached 14xc2xa0billion pesos (us841xc2xa0million){nb 3]as a tropical cyclone patricia's effects in mexico were tremendous; however the affected areas were predominantly rural mitigating a potential large-scale disaster violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities were linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly including one during evacuations total damage was estimated to be in excess of 54xc2xa0billion pesos (us3233xc2xa0million) with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from patricia inflicted us525xc2xa0million in damage across southern texascontents1 meteorological history11 records2

saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon octoberxc2xa011 2015 an area of disturbed weather traversed central america and emerged over the eastern pacific ocean the disturbance moved slowly over the next few days later merging with a tropical wave on octoberxc2xa015 the merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure this feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa020; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205xc2xa0mi (335xc2xa0km) south-southeast of salina cruz mexico a mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path{1]development was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air and the depression became tropical storm patricia later that day{1] once clear of the unfavorable region patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification{1]{2] dramatic strengthening began late on octoberxc2xa021 and continued through octoberxc2xa023 patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa022{1] featuring prominent outflow well-defined banding features{3] and a developing eye{4] data from hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone indicated patricia to have reached categoryxc2xa04 status on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00xc2xa0utc{1]{5]satellite animation of patricia making landfall on octoberxc2xa023by the early hours of octoberxc2xa023 a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration northeast{6] a solid ring of xe2x88x92130xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x9290xc2xa0xc2xb0c) cloud tops surrounded the hurricane's 12xc2xa0mi (19xc2xa0km) wide eye and signaled its intensification into a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane in a 24-hour time span patricia's maximum sustained winds increased by 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the national hurricane center (nhc) the hurricane achieved its peak around 12:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa023 with estimated winds around 215xc2xa0mph (345xc2xa0kmh) and a barometric pressure of 872xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2575xc2xa0inhg); these values are based upon continued intensification after a hurricane hunter mission into the storm six hours prior in the nhc's report on patricia it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed typhoon tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of such{1]later on octoberxc2xa023 rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased in the five hours up until landfall in mexico patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water however it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00xc2xa0utc near cuixmala jalisco with winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) and an analyzed pressure of 932xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2749xc2xa0inhg) this made it the most intense pacific hurricane on record to strike mexico once onshore the high terrain of the sierra madre mountains accelerated patricia's weakening the low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled with the latter accelerating northeast and patricia dissipated on octoberxc2xa024 over central mexico less than 18xc2xa0hours after moving ashore{1]records{edit]see also: meteorological history of hurricane patricia xc2xa7xc2xa0recordshurricane patricia set multiple records for maximum strength rate of intensification and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence with maximum sustained winds of 215xc2xa0mph (345xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 872xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2575xc2xa0inhg) patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the western hemisphere in terms of central pressure it is also the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide just shy of typhoon tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2569xc2xa0inhg){1] patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone surpassing typhoon haiyan of 2013{7] the magnitude of patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed in a 24-hour period 06:00xe2x80x9306:00xc2xa0utc octoberxc2xa022xe2x80x9323 its maximum sustained winds increased from 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) to 205xc2xa0mph (335xc2xa0kmh) a record increase of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) during the same period patricia's central pressure fell by 95xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 281xc2xa0inhg) despite record over-water weakening prior to striking mexico patricia became the most intense pacific hurricane to make landfall with a pressure of 932xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2752xc2xa0inhg){1]preparations{edit]president enrique pexc3xb1a nieto meets with cabinet members to discuss hurricane patricia on octoberxc2xa023before hurricane patricia arrived the government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities a hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa021 encompassing areas of michoacxc3xa1n colima and jalisco a tropical storm watch also covered portions of guerrero as patricia intensified the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between cabo corrientes jalisco and punta san telmo michoacxc3xa1n; a tropical storm warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east the hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of san blas nayarit on octoberxc2xa023 once the storm moved inland and the threat of damaging winds diminished these warnings were gradually discontinued on octoberxc2xa024{1]evacuation from hotel riu vallarta on morning before hurricane patricia made landfallfollowing patricia's upgrade to categoryxc2xa05 status the national hurricane center called the storm "potentially catastrophic"{8] a source of criticism and praise from various media{9] citing the relatively limited damage and loss of life some outlets including the associated press{10] claimed the agency was exaggerating the danger posed by the storm however most outlets praised them for effectively communicating the dire threat and potentially saving lives from an exceptionally powerful hurricane{9]{11]across michoacxc3xa1n colima jalisco and nayarit 1782xc2xa0shelters were opened on octoberxc2xa022 with a collective capacity of 258000xc2xa0people{12] officials in manzanillo began distributing sandbags during the afternoon of octoberxc2xa022{13] schools across guerrero and jalisco suspended activities for octoberxc2xa022 and 23 respectively{14]{15] civil protection officials planned to evacuate roughly 50000xc2xa0people from colima jalisco and nayarit{16] to expedite the process 2xc2xa0aircraft and 600xc2xa0buses were used to shuttle evacuees{17] ultimately 8500xc2xa0people evacuated prior to the storm's arrival including 2600 in cabo corrientes{17]{18] one person died during an evacuation in jalisco{19] roughly 25000xc2xa0personnel from the mexican army navy and federal police were deployed preemptively{20] more than 500xc2xa0red cross volunteers were on standby{21] the mexican red cross prepositioned food for 3500xc2xa0families{22] approximately 30xc2xa0kg (66xc2xa0lb) of aid was prepositioned in colima for distribution after the hurricane's passage the electric federal commission dispatched 2500xc2xa0crewmen 152xc2xa0cranes 15xc2xa0all-terrain vehicles 4xc2xa0helicopters and 84xc2xa0generators to cope with potential power outages{21] mexican authorities received praise for effectively carrying out emergency preparations{23]impact from precursor disturbance{edit]the sprawling precursor to hurricane patricia over central america on octoberxc2xa017the precursor of patricia was a large and sprawling system that affected much of central america with heavy rain for several days{1]{24] rainfall was enhanced by the presence of multiple systems including a tropical wave and a second disturbance over the caribbean sea{1] one person was killed in the alta verapaz department and approximately 2100xc2xa0people required evacuation across guatemala{24]{25] a total of 442xc2xa0homes and 28200xc2xa0ha (70000 acres) of crops were damaged while roughly 223000xc2xa0people were affected by flooding{26]{27] government officials deployed emergency teams and 40xc2xa0million quetzal (us54xc2xa0million) was available for relief operations{26] in nearby el salvador between 63 and 73xc2xa0in (160 and 185xc2xa0mm) of rain fell causing similar floods{28] dozens of homes were affected and four people were killed{28]{29] the goascorxc3xa1n river overflowed its banks twice in two days inundating surrounding communities{28] owing to widespread flooding authorities suspended school activities across the country on octoberxc2xa019{29] in nicaragua a landslide buried four miners in bonanza; one died while the others were rescued{30] the ulxc3xbaa river in honduras over-topped its banks for the first time in 17xc2xa0years on octoberxc2xa018 prompting the evacuation of more than 200xc2xa0people{31]{32] furthermore flooding damaged 10xc2xa0homes in jacxc3xb3 costa rica{33]the aforementioned rains extended into southwestern and northeastern mexico falling from octoberxc2xa018xe2x80x9320; precipitation was enhanced by another tropical disturbance over the northwestern caribbean sea portions of quintana roo saw their most intense rainfall event on record with 198xc2xa0in (502xc2xa0mm) observed in chetumal this surpassed the previous record of 18xc2xa0in (450xc2xa0mm) during hurricane wilma in 2005 flooding affected approximately 1500xc2xa0homes in the city with 150xc2xa0people seeking refuge in public shelters{34] damage in chetumal was pegged at 14xc2xa0billion pesos (us841xc2xa0million){35] seven municipalities were declared disaster areas accordingly{36] in nearby veracruz more than 24xc2xa0in (600xc2xa0mm) of rain caused widespread flooding; at least 50xc2xa0municipalities reported damage from the event as multiple rivers over-topped their banks{37] flooding in tabasco affected 7500xc2xa0ha (19000 acres) of crops{38] in oaxaca several roads were washed out by the accompanying floods and mudslides particularly in the sierra norte region{39] widespread flooding affected large areas of chiapas and guerrero prompting dozens of evacuations{40] in tapachula chiapas 66xc2xa0in (168xc2xa0mm) of rain fell in just 90xc2xa0minutes triggering flash floods that caught residents by surprise hundreds of families were affected and 64xc2xa0homes were damaged or destroyed{41]impact as a tropical cyclone{edit]mexico{edit]hurricane patricia made landfall in jalisco as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane during the evening of octoberxc2xa023 the 15xc2xa0mi (24xc2xa0km) wide core of patricia largely avoided populated centers passing through areas with a population density less than 30xc2xa0people per square mile this alongside effective evacuations is credited for the relatively low death toll despite the hurricane's intensity several small communities along the path sustained tremendous damage however{42] had the hurricane moved farther east or west the densely populated areas surrounding manzanillo or puerto vallarta would have suffered a direct hit{23]throughout the affected region the storm's powerful winds left 261989xc2xa0people without electricity{18]{20] twenty-one of the nation's thirty-one states and the federal district were affected by the hurricane's rain{43] accumulations in jalisco peaked at 1509xc2xa0in (3832xc2xa0mm) on nevado de colima{44] roughly 42000xc2xa0ha (100000 acres) of crops were affected across colima jalisco michoacxc3xa1n and nayarit with 15000xc2xa0ha (37000 acres) deemed a total loss and 27000xc2xa0ha (67000 acres) partially damaged{45] six deaths occurred due to direct or indirect effects of the hurricane all in jalisco{46]{47] damage assessments indicate total losses around 54xc2xa0billion pesos (us3233xc2xa0million) primarily from agriculture and infrastructure{18]{48]{49]{50]{51]jalisco{edit]hurricane patricia hours before making landfall in jaliscostriking jalisco as a strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane patricia wrought tremendous damage though the most extreme effects were relatively localized in the small community of emiliano zapata the hurricane's violent winds tore roofs off homes and business countless trees were defoliated stripped of their branches snapped or uprooted hillsides along the immediate landfall area were largely stripped of vegetation storm chaser josh morgerman described the aftermath: " the tropical landscape was transformed into something barren and wintry"{52] furthermore the winds toppled concrete power poles and crumpled transmission towers{52]throughout jalisco approximately 9000xc2xa0homes were damaged or destroyed{53] the coastal hamlet of chamela home to 40xc2xa0families was completely flattened{54] more than 24000xc2xa0ha (59000 acres) of crops were affected across the state: 10684xc2xa0ha (26400 acres) sustained total losses while 13943xc2xa0ha (34450 acres) were partially so damage from agriculture amounted to roughly 168xc2xa0million pesos (us101xc2xa0million){55] total damage reached to 1139xc2xa0billion pesos (us687xc2xa0million){48]a total of six deaths in incidents related to patricia were reported in the state{46] two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds{47] a woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident another four people were killed in an automobile accident in southern jalisco two of the victims died in the wreckage and the other two died after being brought to a hospital{46]{56]a cargo shipxe2x80x94the 735xc2xa0ft (224xc2xa0m) bulk carrier los llanitos{57]xe2x80x94was shifted off-course by the hurricane and grounded near barra de navidad jalisco her 27xc2xa0crew were unharmed but required rescue by a military helicopter{58] the ship was subsequently deemed a total loss and crews began scrapping the vessel on-site in februaryxc2xa02016{59]colima and michoacxc3xa1n{edit]coastal damage from patricia in colimain nearby colima preliminary surveys indicated localized but severe damage a total of 200xc2xa0schools 107xc2xa0health facilities 34xc2xa0sport facilities and 11645xc2xa0ha (28780 acres) of agriculture was affected by the storm{60] severe damage was incurred by the banana crops with losses from the fruit alone estimated at 500xc2xa0million pesos (us302xc2xa0million){18] total damage in the state reached 17xc2xa0billion pesos (us1026xc2xa0million){49]although patricia made landfall farther west damage across michoacxc3xa1n was severe numerous communities were temporarily isolated as roads were either rendered impassible or washed away altogether by floods{61] a total of 1512xc2xa0homes were damaged and another 127 were destroyed across the state{62] including 600 in coahuayana{63] the storm severely damaged 150xc2xa0homes in the arteaga municipality a portion of highway 200 was shut down in aquila{61] agriculture sustained extensive damage with 10000xc2xa0ha (25000 acres) of crops destroyed; losses in the sector amounted to 25xc2xa0billion pesos (us1512xc2xa0million) in coahuayana alone 5600xc2xa0ha (14000 acres) of bananas were ruined the greatest loss of crops in the municipality's history;{50] thousands of residents lost their jobs as a result of the damage{63] losses to health facilities in the state reached 135xc2xa0million pesos (us815000){51]other states{edit]the hurricane produced large swells along the shores of guerrero on octoberxc2xa022 causing damage to coastal structures{64] the remnants of patricia brought heavy rain to much of northern mexico on octoberxc2xa024 up to 76xc2xa0in (193xc2xa0mm) of rain was observed in tamaulipas resulting in flooding dozens of structures sustained damage and hundreds were left without power with areas in reynosa and rxc3xado bravo particularly affected{65]united states{edit]patricia's direct effects in texas were limited to southern areas of the state moisture associated with the hurricane streamed ahead of its circulation and interacted with a frontal boundary over the region{66] antecedent rains saturated the region and produced severe flooding with cars flooded and a train derailed{67] fears arose that the collective effects of these storms would produce deadly floods similar to those in may earlier in the year; however no deaths resulted{68] houston received 938xc2xa0in (238xc2xa0mm) of rain during a 24-hour span from octoberxc2xa024xe2x80x9325{69] and a brief tornado caused minor damage near the city{70] rain fell at rates of 1 to 2xc2xa0in (25 to 51xc2xa0mm) per hour in southern hidalgo county leading to damaging flash floods an estimated 10 to 12xc2xa0in (250 to 300xc2xa0mm) or more accumulated across the progresoxe2x80x93weslaco area several feet of water rendered roads impassible stranded cars and affected more than 500xc2xa0homes twenty-six water rescues were conducted in the area damage was estimated at 50xc2xa0million{71] several roads in and around corpus christi were inundated{72] including part of interstate 37{73] two hours of "blinding rains" flooded the majority of eastern willacy county prompting multiple water rescues and leaving 25xc2xa0million in damage{74] remnant moisture then moved north and northwest through the great lakes appalachia and mid-atlantic states and florida pandhandle before exiting the nation{75]{76]aftermath{edit]in the aftermath of the hurricane 5791xc2xa0marines from mexico's naval infantry force were deployed to assist with recovery and rescue efforts{77] rescuers reached some of the hardest-hit areas within a day of patricia's landfall{23] red cross volunteers began needs assessments on octoberxc2xa024 and distribution of humanitarian aid started the following day{22] power was restored to 88xc2xa0percent of those affected within two days of the storm{20] through the nation's livestock catastrophe fund 150xc2xa0million pesos (us9xc2xa0million) were allocated for agricultural areas affected by the storm on octoberxc2xa029 of this total 76xc2xa0million pesos (us46xc2xa0million) were delegated to jalisco{78]the secretariat of social development's budget allowed for 250xc2xa0million pesos (us151xc2xa0million) in relief funds for jalisco{47] of this 34xc2xa0million pesos (us2xc2xa0million) were allocated for affected persons{79] on octoberxc2xa027 rafael pacchiano alamxc3xa1n announced an initial fund of 53xc2xa0million pesos (us318000) through the temporary employment program (programa de empleo temporal) to help spur economic recovery in colima{80] on octoberxc2xa028 15 of jalisco's 125xc2xa0municipalities were declared disaster areas; assessments were ongoing in 5xe2x80x9310xc2xa0other municipalities to potentially be added to this declaration{81] of the more than 24000xc2xa0ha (59000 acres) of crops affected by patricia in jalisco only 6600xc2xa0ha (16000 acres) were covered by insurance{55] through late januaryxc2xa02016 instituto nacional del emprendedor provided entrepreneurs with 3577xc2xa0million pesos (us194000) in funds{82]in januaryxc2xa02016 the michoacxc3xa1n ministry of social development enacted a
