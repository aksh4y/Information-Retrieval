shortly thereafter its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars{1]the storm turned northward on august 21{6] and eventually curved northeastward debbie weakened to category 2 strength but for the fourth time restrengthened to major hurricane intensity{1] the hurricane then passed well to the southeast of bermuda{1] although it is believed that if not for the presence of nearby hurricane camille which emerged into the atlantic from the united states on august 20 debbie would have likely ended up further west closer to the island{5] it maintained its severity through august 22 as it continued generally toward the northeast{1]the storm's eyeon august 23 the storm began a weakening trend and it turned towards the north{1] the next day the stormxe2x80x94having weakened to category 1 statusxe2x80x94skirted the southeastern tip of newfoundland{7] debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast{8] and it weakened into a tropical storm early on august 25{1] as it moved over increasingly cold waters it dissipated east of greenland{5]impact and project stormfury{edit]this radar image from a navy reconnaissance aircraft of hurricane debbie was taken on august 20 1969 around 1519 utcmain article: project stormfurydebbie was subject to an experiment called project stormfury which attempted to weaken tropical cyclones by seeding them with silver iodide{5] the storm provided an excellent opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding: it did not threaten any land; it passed within range of seeding aircraft; and was intense with a distinct eye{9] on august 18 and again on august 20 thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it on the first day windspeeds fell by 31 on the second day windspeeds fell by 18{5]{10] both changes were consistent with stormfury's working hypothesis the results were so encouraging that "a greatly expanded research program was planned"{11] among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals{5]debbie remained predominately at sea throughout its 3000xc2xa0mi (4800xc2xa0km) path and as a result it caused little damage{5] the storm had little or no impact on the island of bermuda as it passed to the south{12] later winds of 50 to 65xc2xa0mph (80 to 105xc2xa0kmh) were recorded over eastern newfoundland{8]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portal1969 atlantic hurricane seasonreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j atlantic hurricane research division (2009) "atlantic hurricane database (hurdat) "best track" (1851xe2x80x932008)" national oceanic and atmospheric administrations archived from the original on may 4 2009 retrieved january 11 2010xc2xa0^ forecaster simpson (august 15 1969) "national hurricane center bulletin 10 am edt friday august 15 1969" national hurricane center retrieved january 27 2010xc2xa0^ forecaster hope (august 15 1969) "tropical storm debbie public advisory number 1" national hurricane center retrieved january 27 2010xc2xa0^ forecaster herbert (august 19 1969) "hurricane debbie public advisory number 18" national hurricane center retrieved january 27 2010xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g rh simpson;
