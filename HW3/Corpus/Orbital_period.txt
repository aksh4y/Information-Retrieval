message)the orbital period is the time a given astronomical object takes to complete one orbit around another object and applies in astronomy usually to planets or asteroids orbiting the sun moons orbiting planets exoplanets orbiting other stars or binary starsfor objects in the solar system this is often referred to as the sidereal period determined by a 360xc2xb0 revolution of one celestial body around another eg the earth orbiting the sun the name sidereal is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky when describing orbits of binary stars the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period for example jupiter has a sidereal period of 1186 years while the main binary star alpha centauri ab has a period of about 7991 yearsanother important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earth's surface an example is the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 3988 days from earth; thus jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 monthsperiods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time often in hours days or years they can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies (barycenter) perturbations by other planets or bodies orbital resonance general

in the various fields of astronomy and astrophysics examples of some of the common ones includexc2xa0:the sidereal period is the amount of time that it takes an object to make a full orbit relative to the stars this is the orbital period in an inertial (non-rotating) frame of referencethe synodic period is the amount of time that it takes for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects (eg the moon's phase and its position relative to the sun and earth repeats every 295 day synodic period longer than its 273 day orbit around the earth due to the motion of the earth about the sun) the time between two successive oppositions or conjunctions is also an example of the synodic period for the planets in the solar system the synodic period (with respect to earth) differs from the sidereal period due to the earth's orbiting around the sunthe draconitic period or draconic period is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its ascending node the point of its orbit where it crosses the ecliptic from the southern to the northern hemisphere this period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars so their intersection the line of nodes also precesses with respect to the fixed stars although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific epoch the orbital plane of the object still precesses causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal periodthe anomalistic period is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its periapsis (in the case of the planets in the solar system called the perihelion) the point of its closest approach to the attracting body it differs from the sidereal period because the object's semi-major axis typically advances slowlyalso the earth's tropical period (or simply its "year") is the time that elapses between two alignments of its axis of rotation with the sun also viewed as two passages of the object at right ascension zero one earth year has a slightly shorter interval than the solar orbit (sidereal period) because the inclined axis and equatorial plane slowly precess (rotate with respect to the stars) realigning with the sun before the orbit completes the earth's precession cycle completes in about 25770 years{citation needed]small body orbiting a central body{edit]the semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis (b) of an ellipseaccording to kepler's third law the orbital period t (in seconds) of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:{citation needed]t=2xcfx80a3xcexbc{displaystyle t=2pi {sqrt {frac {a^{3}}{mu }}}}where:a is the orbit's semi-major axis in metersxcexbc = gm is the standard gravitational parameter in m3s2g is the gravitational constantm is the mass of the more massive bodyfor all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same regardless of eccentricityinversely for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to pulse a given orbital period:a=gmt24xcfx8023{displaystyle a={sqrt{{3}]{frac {gmt^{2}}{4pi ^{2}}}}}where:a is the orbit's semi-major axis in metersg is the gravitational constantm is the mass of the more massive bodyt is the orbital period in secondsfor instance for completing an orbit every 24xc2xa0hours around a mass of 100xc2xa0kg a small body has to orbit at a distance of 108xc2xa0meters from its center of massorbital period as a function of central body's density{edit]when a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density xcfx81 (in kgm3) the above equation simplifies to (since mxc2xa0= vxcfx81xc2xa0= 43xcfx80a3xcfx81){1]>:t=3xcfx80gxcfx81{displaystyle t={sqrt {frac {3pi }{grho }}}}so for the earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density about 5515xc2xa0kgm3){2] we get:t = 141 hoursand for a body made of water (xcfx81xc2xa0xe2x89x88xc2xa01000xc2xa0kgm3){3]t = 330 hoursthus as an alternative for using a very small number like g the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material like water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes conversely this can be used as a kind of "universal" unit of time if we have a unit of mass a unit of length and a unit of densitytwo bodies orbiting each other{edit]in celestial mechanics when both orbiting bodies' masses have to be taken into account the orbital period t can be calculated as follows:{4]t=2xcfx80a3g(m1+m2){displaystyle t=2pi {sqrt {frac {a^{3}}{gleft(m_{1}+m_{2}right)}}}}where:a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move or equivalently the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin (which is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits)m1 + m2 is the sum of the masses of the two bodiesg is the gravitational constantnote that the orbital period is independent of size: for a scale model it would be the same when densities are the same (see also orbitscaling in gravity){citation needed]in a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory the motion is not periodic and the duration of the full trajectory is infinitesynodic period{edit]there are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits and thus have different orbital periods this is known as their synodic period; it is the time between conjunctions and since it is observable from either the first or the second body the two synodic periods will be different depending from which celestial body you are observingan example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earth's surface the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 3988 days from earth; thus jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 monthsif the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called p1 and p2 so that p1xc2xa0<xc2xa0p2 their synodic period is given by:{citation needed]1psyn=1p1xe2x88x921p2{displaystyle

planet's moon the synodic period usually means the sun-synodic period namely the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet's surface the earth's motion does not determine this value for other planets because an earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question for example deimos's synodic period is
