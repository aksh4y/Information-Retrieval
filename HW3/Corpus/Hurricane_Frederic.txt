ricohispaniolacubaeast coast of the united statesatlantic canadapart of the 1979 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane frederic was an intense and damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of damage from the lesser antilles to quebec in particular devastating areas of the united states gulf coast though only five were killed directly the us23xc2xa0billion in damage accrued by frederic made it the atlantic basin's costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time prior to its final landfall the threat that frederic imposed on areas of the us gulf coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past while the storm primarily impacted the us states of mississippi and alabama lesser effects were felt throughout the greater and lesser antilles as well as inland north americafrederic developed from a tropical depression south of the cape verde islands on augustxc2xa028 1979{nb 1] tracking at a steady clip westward the primitive cyclone reached tropical storm intensity the next day favorable conditions in the open atlantic allowed for frederic to reach hurricane intensity on septemberxc2xa01 however outflow from nearby hurricane david began to inhibit further intensification and would continue to do so for roughly a week weakening frederic as it tracked across the greater antilles the tropical cyclone nearly dissipated over cuba before redeveloping on septemberxc2xa09 near the isle of youth from then on frederic moved northwestward intensifying to its peak intensity in the gulf of mexico with winds of 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) on septemberxc2xa012 shortly before making landfall at dauphin island alabama just below the state line between alabama and mississippi over the united states frederic weakened for a final time before becoming extratropical in pennsylvania on septemberxc2xa014 and dissipating the next daydamage estimates vary from 6xe2x80x939xc2xa0billion (2008 usd) with variations due to inadequate reporting of private insurance claims as well as lack of hard data on uninsured damage fema which had been established only three months before frederic hit was the focal point for nearly 250xc2xa0million in federal aid for recovery 188xc2xa0million of which went to alabama (1979 usd)contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 lesser antilles and puerto rico32 hispaniola and cuba33 united states331 florida332 alabama333 mississippi34 canada4 aftermath41 retirement5 see also6 notes7 references8 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe precursor to hurricane frederic emerged as a loosely defined tropical wave off the west coast of africa late on augustxc2xa027 the following day satellite images indicated that the tropical wave had become more defined and was beginning to show signs of cyclonic rotation at 0600xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa029 the national hurricane centerxc2xa0(nhc) classified the system as a tropical depression based on observational data from ships nearby in conjunction with satellite images{1]{2] upon developing into a tropical cyclone the depression moved at an unusually rapid pace westward gradually curving towards the west-northwest and slowly intensifying in ideal conditions at 1200xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa030{2] the tropical depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and thus named frederic{1] intensification continued after the storm's upgrade and early on septemberxc2xa01 frederic developed an eye prompting the nhc to further upgrade the tropical cyclone to hurricane status at 0600xc2xa0utc that day{1]{2]frederic only maintained hurricane intensity for roughly eighteen hours over the open waters of the atlantic on septemberxc2xa01 before outflow from nearby hurricane david began to adversely affect the tropical cyclone{1]{2] at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa02 frederic weakened back to tropical storm strength while it was still well east of the lesser antilles this weakening phase continued as frederic began to assume a more westerly track and slow in forward motion{1] on septemberxc2xa04 frederic tracked over the virgin islands before making landfall on puerto rico later that day with maximum sustained winds of 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh){2] frederic's interaction with puerto rico greatly disrupted the low-level circulation contained within the tropical cyclone enhancing the weakening effects of hurricane david's outflow after passing over the island the tropical storm briefly took a southwest course before curving into hispaniola on septemberxc2xa06 inducing additional disruption within frederic at 1800xc2xa0utc that day frederic was downgraded to tropical depression status north of haiti{1] frederic remained a tropical depression for two days as it tracked into and then parallel to the southern coast of cuba beginning on septemberxc2xa07{2] during this time hurricane david had tracked far into the northeastern united states and as a result its inhibiting effects of intensification ceased{1] at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa09{2] frederic regained tropical storm intensity while located roughly 100xc2xa0mi (160xc2xa0kmh) east of the isle of youth the following day the cyclone tracked over western cuba as it gradually curved towards the northwest{2]favorable conditions marked by very warm sea surface temperatures as high as 86xc2xbafxc2xa0(30xc2xbac) and the presence of a large anticyclone over the system allowed frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of cuba despite proximity to land{1] frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the gulf of mexico in early september intensifying in a highly conducive environment{1] by 1800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa010 the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central atlantic at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa012 frederic attained major hurricane status over the eastern gulf of mexico and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 943xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2785xc2xa0inhg) and sustained winds of 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh){nb 2] making the cyclone a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale{2] moving gradually faster in the gulf of mexico{1] frederic eventually made two landfallsxc2xa0xe2x80x93 one on dauphin island and the other near the border between alabama and mississippixc2xa0xe2x80x93 with a virtually unchanged intensity{2]{4] tracking rapidly northward frederic began to weaken due to land interaction and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near meridian mississippi on septemberxc2xa013{1] at around the same time the cyclone began to curve northeastward{2] eventually merging with an extratropical cyclone in southwestern pennsylvania by 1800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa014 these extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the mid-atlantic states and new england before they were last officially documented by the nhc in new brunswick on septemberxc2xa015{1]{2] however the canadian hurricane centre still considered the cyclone active up until the storm entered the labrador sea on septemberxc2xa016{5]preparations{edit]evacuation out of the mobile areathe first tropical cyclone watches and warnings issued in association with frederic were on septemberxc2xa03 when the national hurricane center issued a hurricane warning and gale warning for several islands of the lesser antilles stretching from dominica to the northern leeward islands{6] residents of charlotte amalie in the united states virgin islands were urged by governor juan francisco luis to move to 24xc2xa0emergency shelters{7] luis also mobilized a company of the virgin islands national guard to expedite evacuations and protect emptied residences and other buildings from looting{8] further south in dominica melville hall airport was forced to close due to the precense of gale force winds delaying relief efforts following hurricane david{9]despite having weakened to a tropical storm by the time frederic moved over the virgin islands the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for puerto rico on septemberxc2xa04{10] as precautionary measures the luis muxc3xb1oz marxc3xadn international airport and schools closed for the duration of the storm{8] hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate from toa baja for the second time in just four days due to the threat of flooding rivers{11] in trujillo alto a dike was relieved in order to mitigate potential flooding{12] after its track across puerto rico gale warnings were issued for portions of the dominican republic and haiti as well as the turks and caicos islands{13] no watches or warnings were issued by the nhc for any areas while frederic was classified as a tropical depression over the greater antilles{14] however small craft warnings were posted for some coastal regions off of miami florida due to strong winds caused by the nearby tropical cyclone{15]after frederic reattained hurricane status in the gulf of mexico on septemberxc2xa010 a gale warning were issued for the dry tortugas; this was the first nhc warning issued in association with the newly developed tropical cyclone{2]{14] not long after a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from panama city florida to vermilion bay in louisiana{14] although forecasts showed that frederic posed no threat to sarasota florida the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to sarasota county's 58xc2xa0emergency shelters municipality managers were asked to place their respective emergency personnel on standby{16] in key west florida city workers had shortened workdays while the storm moved close by{17]up to 500000 were evacuated from the us gulf coast in anticipation of frederic's arrival{citation needed]impact{edit]lesser antilles and puerto rico{edit]effects from frederic were first felt on the outward facing leeward islands in antigua the threat of widespread power outages forced the insular government to shut down power{18]{10] a peak gust of 62xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) was documented on the island as a result of the storm{1] these strong winds also unroofed some buildings{8] strong winds and rain were felt in guadeloupe barbuda and a number of other islands but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations{18] power outages knocked out electricity to half of tortola in the british virgin islands and downed telephone lines rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads{19] offshore the yacht princess blew out into sea prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew{8]as a tropical storm{2] frederic dropped heavy rain across the us virgin islands and puerto rico despite having weakened from its prior hurricane intensity the storm still brought gale-force winds coupled with gusts as strong as 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) to the area{1] three apartments in the same apartment complex on st thomas were unroofed displacing roughly 50xc2xa0families{20] electricity was deliberately cut during the late night hours to prevent the spread of power outages{12] in st maarten these strong winds toppled a radio antenna{7] the entirety of the us virgin islands reported numerous felled trees and downed utility lines as a result of the strong winds wind damage on nearby puerto rico was of only minor extent and much less severe than in the virgin islands{20] however torrential precipitation accounted for most of the damage as the passage of hurricane david less than a week earlier saturated soils priming the area for floods induced by the passage of frederic rainfall peaked at around 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) in 12xc2xa0hours in puerto rico and 2404xc2xa0in (611xc2xa0mm) in 30xc2xa0hours in st croix{1]{21]rainfall totals in puerto rico and the us virgin islandsall rivers in southeastern puerto rico swelled and produce significant flooding in adjacent floodplains the discharge of the rio santiago near naguabo reached 100-year levels these floods partially inundated several cities submerged crops and damaged numerous roads major arterial roads to and from ponce were blocked by floodwater and landslide debris some portions of puerto rico highwayxc2xa03 were submerged by water from both the torrential rain and wave action damage from frederic in puerto rico reached at least us5xc2xa0million though western puerto rico sustained minimal damage from the storm in st thomas four small homes were destroyed by flooding and an additional fifty sustained at least partial damage one waterspout was reported off the coast but did no damage normally dry coastal guts in st croix filled with floodwater from frederic damaging homes and other buildings in five communities on st croix culverts bridges and heavy beach erosion resulted from rough surf off the coast of the island the floods generated various sewage problems{20] flowing floodwaters washed away plentiful food crops in st maarten{8] some homes were damaged and others destroyed on the adjacent sint maarten{11] off of the island seven people were killed after their fishing boat sank during the storm{1] damage in virgin islands also reached at least us5xc2xa0million similar to puerto rico{20]hispaniola and cuba{edit]heavy rains buffeted the islands of hispaniola and cuba for several days as frederic albeit disorganized{22] tracked over the greater antilles as with puerto rico and the lesser antilles precipitation damage was exacerbated by the recent passage of hurricane david in guantxc3xa1namo on cuba's eastern atlantic coast at least 688xc2xa0in (175xc2xa0mm) of rainfall was reported frederic continued to produce strong winds even as a weak tropical depression south of cuba as sustained winds of 46xc2xa0mph (74xc2xa0kmh) were clocked in santa cruz del sur on septemberxc2xa07 however damage from frederic in hispaniola and eastern cuba remained minimal{1]frederic's landfall on western cuba as a redeveloped tropical cyclone was much more significant than its first cuban landfall sustained winds peaked at 52xc2xa0mph (84xc2xa0kmh) in bahxc3xada honda cuba on septemberxc2xa010{1] despite recent renovations at josxc3xa9 martxc3xad international airport the lack of a proper drainage system allowed rainfall to inundate the airport stranding several heads of state that were scheduled to hold a summit and disrupting air traffic to and from the airport for an entire week{23] heavy precipitation triggered numerous landslides causing severe damage to infrastructure and over 250xc2xa0dwellings areas at risk for additional landslide activity were declared inhospitable resulting in the evacuation of 1200xc2xa0people{24] rainfall estimates in cuba peaked at 5xc2xa0in (125xc2xa0mm){25] a lack of damage reports was evident from western cuba following frederic's landfall though damage estimates were high{1]united states{edit]the dauphin island bridge was destroyed by hurricane frederic making it only reachable by boatstorm surge damage was reported along 80xc2xa0miles of coastline from mississippi to florida with tides 8 to 12xc2xa0feet (24-37 m) above the normal level being observed five deaths were directly attributed to frederic in the united states four of which occurred inland: a person swept from a boat near pensacola was the only casualty along the coast{1] in total frederic was responsible for 23xc2xa0billion (1979 usd; 75xc2xa0 billion 2015 usd) in damages this made frederic the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states at the time; the figure was not surpassed until hurricane hugo in 1989{26] frederic also dumped heavy rainfall across much of the eastern united states over a dozen tornadoes were also reported in frederic's wake however these had minimal impact{27]florida{edit]as frederic was strengthening in the gulf of mexico strong winds were reported in the florida keys a station on the dry tortugas recorded a 58xc2xa0mph (93xc2xa0kmh) wind gust on septemberxc2xa010; this was stronger than any other florida wind gust measurement in association with frederic a station in key west florida clocked at 43xc2xa0mph (69xc2xa0kmh) wind gust coupled with sustained winds of 29xc2xa0mph (47xc2xa0kmh){1] tides in the dry tortugas peaked at 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) roughly 12xc2xa0ft (67xc2xa0m) above normal{16]{28] rainfall from the extremities of the hurricane reached south florida{29] with some rainfall totals exceeding 7xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm){21]alabama{edit]frederic made landfall at dauphin island alabama and continued across to a point on the alabamamississippi state line near bayou la batre alabama{30] near-total property damage occurred along the alabama coastline between fort morgan and gulf shores the latter seeing 80 of its buildings completely destroyed the causeway linking dauphin island to the mainland was swept away in many areas{26] alabama's second-largest city mobile alabama suffered extensive damage as well wind damage was also severe especially across southern alabama hurricane-force gusts were felt as far inland as choctaw county structural failure was widespread in the immediate landfall area with industrial residential and governmental buildings as well as hospitals suffering heavy damage nearly 90 of the mobile area lost electricity and the historic city hall experienced heavy roof damage many small beach houses were completely destroyed by high winds before the storm surge could add any effects{26]{31] tree damage with broken limbs was extensive leaving thousands of tall pine trees all tilted leaning in the direction the wind had come 11 alabama counties were declared disaster areasmississippi{edit]8 to 12xc2xa0inches of rain fell in jackson county mississippi around biloxi and pascagoula 16 mississippi counties were declared disaster areas; the most in the united states hurricane force winds were felt as far northward as meridian mississippi{32]canada{edit]frederic dropped heavy rain across canada as an extratropical storm peaking at 137xc2xa0mm (539xc2xa0in) near ottawa ontario record precipitation was recorded at the j s marshall radar observatory in sainte-anne-de-bellevue quebec which documented 77xc2xa0mm (303xc2xa0in) of rain on septemberxc2xa015 rainfall spread as far northeast as the eastern coast of labrador flooding occurred in eastern ontario and portions of the niagara peninsula as noted in cornwall in toronto the rains led to a seven-car traffic collision and a separate car accident that injured two flooding also took place in southern quebec with floodwater submerging streets basements and underground parking lots in montreal damage from southern quebec reached c8238xc2xa0million (us7095xc2xa0million){5]aftermath{edit]damage after hurricane frederic in gulf shores alabamaeleven counties in alabama sixteen in mississippi and five in florida were declared eligible for disaster aidin retrospect frederic has been credited with spurring redevelopment in mobile and the surrounding gulf coast region for example in testimony before congress in 1992 robert sheets (then the director of the national hurricane center) described the economic aftermath of frederic:"prior to hurricane frederic there was one condominium complex on gulf shores alabama most of the homes were single individual homes built behind the sand dunes today where there used to be one condominium there are now at least 104 complexesxc2xa0xe2x80x93 not units complexesxc2xa0xe2x80x93 on gulf shores alabama"retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of extensive destruction the name frederic was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was
