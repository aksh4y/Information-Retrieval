and nimbus ("rainstorm" "storm cloud") is a dense towering vertical cloud{1] associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents if observed during a storm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads cumulonimbus can form alone in clusters or along cold front squall lines these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather such as tornadoes cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell cumulonimbus is abbreviated

also6 references7 external linksappearance{edit]towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller cumulus clouds the cumulonimbus base may extend several miles across and occupy low to middle altitudes- formed at altitude from approximately 200 to 4000xc2xa0m (700 to 10000xc2xa0ft) peaks typically reach to as much as 40000xc2xa0ft (12000xc2xa0m) with extreme instances as high as 70000xc2xa0ft (21000xc2xa0m) or more{2] well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat anvil-like top (anvil dome) caused by wind shear or inversion near the tropopause the shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud's vertical component for many miles and be accompanied by lightning occasionally rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level when vertically developed this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparisonspecies{edit]cumulonimbus calvus: cloud with puffy top similar to cumulus congestus which it develops from; under the correct conditions it can become a cumulonimbus

strong thunderstormeffects{edit]see also: severe weather thunderstorm and tornadocumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential rain of a convective nature (often in the form of a rain shaft) and flash flooding as well as straight-line winds most storm cells die after about 20xc2xa0minutes when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft causing the energy to dissipate if there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere however (on a hot summer's day for example) the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidlyxe2x80x94resulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one this can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms (called "blizzards") which bring lightning thunder and torrential snow however cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions{9]life cycle or stages{edit]in general cumulonimbus require moisture an unstable air mass and a lifting force (heat) in order to form cumulonimbus typically go through three stages: the developing stage the mature stage (where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions) and the dissipation stage{10] the average thunderstorm has a 24xc2xa0km (15xc2xa0mi) diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through{11]stages of a

cloud typesclouds form when the dewpoint of water is reached in the presence of condensation nuclei in the troposphere the atmosphere is a dynamic system and the local conditions of turbulence uplift and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized furthermore some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as wave clouds or actinoform clouds these are large-scale structures and are not always readily identifiable from a single point of viewsee also{edit]weather portalatmospheric
