hurricane seasonhistory meteorological historyeffects floridathe bahamasother wikis commons: wilma imageshurricane wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the atlantic basin as well as the most intense recorded in the western hemisphere until hurricane patricia in 2015 part of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever (along with 4 rita and 7 katrina) wilma was the twenty-second storm thirteenth hurricane sixth major hurricane fourth category 5 hurricane and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season a tropical depression formed in the caribbean sea near jamaica on october 15 headed westward and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named wilma wilma continued to strengthen and eventually became a hurricane on october 18 shortly thereafter explosive intensification occurred and in only 24 hours wilma became a category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour (298xc2xa0kmh)wilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a category 5 hurricane and winds had decreased to 150 miles per hour (240xc2xa0kmh) before it reached the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on october 20 and 21 after crossing the yucatxc3xa1n wilma emerged into the gulf of mexico as a category 2 hurricane as wilma began accelerating to the northeast gradual re-intensification occurred and the hurricane was upgraded to category 3 on october 24 shortly thereafter wilma made landfall in cape romano florida with winds of 120 miles per hour (190xc2xa0kmh) as wilma was crossing florida it briefly weakened back to a category 2 hurricane but again re-intensified as it reached the atlantic ocean the hurricane intensified into a category 3 hurricane for the last time but dropped below that intensity while accelerating northeastward by october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of nova scotiawilma made several landfalls with the most destructive effects felt in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula of mexico cuba and the us state of florida at least 62 deaths were reported and damage total estimated at 294xc2xa0billion (equivalent to 361xc2xa0billion in 2017) with in the united states 21xc2xa0billion (258xc2xa0billion in 2017){1] as a result wilma is ranked as the sixth costliest hurricane in united states history wilma was the most recent major hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states until hurricane harvey made landfall in southern texas on august 26 2017 ending a record length of time xe2x80x93 slightly over 11 years and 10 months xe2x80x93 without any major hurricanes making landfall in the united states wilma was also the last hurricane to strike

history{edit]main article: meteorological history of hurricane wilmamap plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the caribbean sea during mid-october as a lower-tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather aided by an upper-level low across the region a broad area of low pressure developed on october 13 to the southeast of jamaica and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased dvorak classifications began on october 14 and by late october 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined with sufficiently organized deep convection for the national hurricane center to designate the system as tropical depression twenty-four while located about 220xc2xa0mi (350xc2xa0km) east-southeast of grand cayman{1]the depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into tropical storm wilma on october 17 initially development was slow due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient however convection gradually organized and from october 18 through october 19 wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the caribbean sea around 12:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa018 the system intensified into a hurricane in a 30xe2x80x91hour period the pressure dropped from 982xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2900xc2xa0inhg) to the record-low of 882xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2605xc2xa0inhg) while the winds increased to 185xc2xa0mph (295xc2xa0kmh) during its intensification on octoberxc2xa019 the hurricane's eye shrank to as small as 23xc2xa0mi (37xc2xa0km) in diameter becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone{1]play mediasatellite video of wilma's lifespanon octoberxc2xa020 wilma weakened below category 5 intensity to 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) due to an eyewall replacement cycle began to turn towards the northwest and further slowed its movement late on octoberxc2xa021 wilma made landfall on the island of cozumel quintana roo at around 21:45xc2xa0utc with maximum sustained winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) and then again made a second landfall on the mexican mainland six hours later and only slightly weaker wilma continued to slowly drift towards the north over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula although it weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land it reemerged over the southern gulf of mexico on october 23 around 00:00xc2xa0utc despite wilma spending 24 hours over land it rexc3xabmerged with little intensity lost and began to re-intensify shortly after this was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest caribbean and gulf of mexico a powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion its large eye remained well-organized and wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear briefly producing winds of 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) before making landfall on cape romano florida as a 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) major hurricane{1]wilma crossed the state in about 46xc2xa0hours and weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) after entering the atlantic ocean near jupiter florida key west received several feet of water in the low-lying areas and flooded homes the lower keys also experienced an unusual flood: it occurred twice first as the storm approached florida it pushed water across the keys from south to north as the storm finally crossed into the everglades all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as wilma crossed the peninsula the water then raced back across the lower keys a second time and went back out to sea this caused additional flooding and costly damage possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the gulf stream wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) and subsequently absorbed tropical storm alpha to the south before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection on october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and on the next day the remnants of wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over atlantic canada{1]preparations{edit]cayman islands and central america{edit]the national hurricane center (nhc) issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches throughout
