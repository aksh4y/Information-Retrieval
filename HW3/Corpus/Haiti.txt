ayiti){8] and formerly called hayti{note 1] is a sovereign state located on the island of hispaniola in the greater antilles archipelago of the caribbean sea it occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the dominican republic{11]{12] haiti is 27750 square kilometres (10714xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) in size and has an estimated 108 million people{3] making it the most populous country in the caribbean community (caricom) and the second-most populous country in the caribbean as a wholethe region was originally inhabited by the indigenous taxc3xadno people spain discovered the island on 5 december 1492 during the first voyage of christopher columbus across the atlantic when columbus initially landed in haiti he had thought he had found india or asia{13] on christmas day 1492 columbus' flagship the santa maria ran aground north of what is now limonade{14]{15]{16]{17] as a consequence columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship and he created the first european settlement in the americas naming it la navidad after the day the ship was destroyedthe island was named la espaxc3xb1ola and claimed by spain which ruled until the early 17th century competing claims and settlements by the french led to the western portion of the island being ceded to france which named it saint-domingue sugarcane plantations worked by slaves brought from africa were established by colonistsin the midst of the french revolution (1789xe2x80x931799) slaves and free people of colour revolted in the haitian revolution (1791xe2x80x931804) culminating in the abolition of slavery and the defeat of napoleon bonaparte's army at the battle of vertixc3xa8res afterward the sovereign nation of haiti was established on 1 january 1804xc2xa0xe2x80x93  the first independent nation of latin america and the caribbean the second republic in the americas the only nation in the western hemisphere to have defeated three european great powers (france spain and the uk) and the only nation in the world established as a result of a successful slave revolt{18]{19] the rebellion that began in 1791 was led by a former slave and the first black general of the french army toussaint louverture whose military genius and political acumen transformed an entire society of slaves into an independent country upon his death in a prison in france he was succeeded by his lieutenant jean-jacques dessalines who declared haiti's sovereignty and later became the first emperor of haiti jacques i{20]{21]{22]{23] the haitian revolution lasted just over a dozen years; and

comes from the indigenous taxc3xadno language which was the native name{note 2] given to the entire island of hispaniola to mean "land of high mountains"{34] the h is silent in french and the xc3xaf in haxc3xafti is a diacritical mark used to show that the second vowel is pronounced separately as in the word naxc3xafve{35] in english this rule for the pronunciation is often disregarded thus the spelling haiti is used there are different anglicizations for its pronunciation such as high-ti high-ee-ti and haa-ee-ti which are still in use but hay-ti is the most widespread and established{36]the name was restored by haitian revolutionary jean-jacques dessalines as the official name of independent saint-domingue as a tribute to the amerindian predecessors{37]in french haiti's nickname is the pearl of the antilles (la perle des antilles) because of both its natural beauty{38] and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the kingdom of france as it was considered the richest colony owned by any of the european powers at the time{39]history{edit]main article: history of haitipre-columbian history{edit]main article: chiefdoms of hispaniolathe five caciquedoms of hispaniola at the time of the arrival of christopher columbusat the time of european encounter the island of hispaniola of which haiti occupies the western three-eighths{11]{12] was one of many caribbean islands inhabited by the taxc3xadno indians speakers of an arawakan language called taino which has been preserved in the haitian creole language the taxc3xadno name for the entire island was haiti the people had migrated over centuries into the caribbean islands from south america genetic studies show they were related to the yanomami of the amazon basin they also originated in central and south america after migrating to caribbean islands in the 15th century the taxc3xadno were pushed into the northeast caribbean islands by the caribs{40]in the taxc3xadno societies of the caribbean islands the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique or chief as the europeans understood them the island of haiti was divided among five caciquats: the magua in the north east the marien in the north west the xaragua in the south west the maguana in the center region of cibao and the higuey in the south east{41]{42] the caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms with payment consisting of harveststaxc3xadno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country these have become national symbols of haiti and tourist attractions modern-day lxc3xa9ogane started as a french colonial town in the southwest is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of xaragua{40]spanish rule (1492xe2x80x931625){edit]christopher columbus landing on hispaniola1510 taxc3xadno

island for the crown of castile nineteen days later his ship the santa marxc3xada ran aground near the present site of cap-haxc3xaftien columbus left 39 men on the island who founded the settlement of la navidadthe sailors carried endemic eurasian infectious diseases the natives lacked immunity to these new diseases and died in great numbers in epidemics{44]{45] the first recorded smallpox epidemic in the americas erupted on hispaniola in 1507{46] the encomienda system forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations{47]the spanish passed the laws of burgos 1512xe2x80x9313 which forbade the maltreatment of natives endorsed their conversion to catholicism{48] and gave legal framework to encomiendas the natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industries{49]as a gateway to the caribbean hispaniola became a haven for pirates during the early colonial period the western part of the island was settled by french buccaneers among them was bertrand d'ogeron who succeeded in growing tobacco he recruited many french colonial families from martinique and guadeloupe european nations were competing for control in the new world in the caribbean as well as in north america france and spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the treaty of ryswick of 1697 and divided hispaniola between themfrench rule (1625xe2x80x931804){edit]further information: saint-dominguefrance received the western third and subsequently named it saint-domingue the french equivalent of santo domingo the spanish colony of hispaniola and the name of its patron saint saint dominic{50]to develop it into sugarcane plantations the french imported thousands of slaves from africa sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century by 1789 approximately 40000 white colonists lived in saint-domingue in contrast by 1763 the white population of french canada a vast territory had numbered 65000{51] the whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of african slaves they had imported to work on their plantations which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane in the north of the island slaves were able to retain many ties to african cultures religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported africans blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to onethe french-enacted code noir ("black code") prepared by jean-baptiste colbert and ratified by louis xiv had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms saint-domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported africans died within a few years{52] many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever{53] they had low birth rates and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slavery{citation needed]as in its louisiana colony the french colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color: the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves (and later mixed-race women) over time many were released from slavery they established a separate social class white french creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to france for their education some men of color were admitted into the military more of the free people of color lived in the south of the island near port-au-prince and many intermarried within their community they frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen and began to own some property some became slave holders the free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rightsslaves that made it to haiti from the trans-atlantic journey and slaves born in haiti were first documented in haiti's archives and transferred to france's ministry of defense and the ministry of foreign affairs as of 2015{update] these records are in the national archives of france according to the 1788 census haiti's population consisted of nearly 25000 whites 22000 free coloureds and 700000 slaves{citation needed]haitian revolution (1791xe2x80x931804){edit]main article: haitian revolutionburning of the town of

french west indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights most important was the revolution of the slaves in saint-domingue starting in the northern plains in 1791 where africans greatly outnumbered the whitesin 1792 the french government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control to build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves the french commissioners sonthonax and polverel abolished slavery in the colony six months later the national convention led by robespierre and the jacobins endorsed abolition and extended it to all the french colonies{54]political leaders in the united states which was a new republic itself reacted with ambivalence at times providing aid to enable planters to put down the revolt later in the revolution the us provided support to black haitian military forces with the goal of reducing french influence in north america and the caribbean{55]toussaint louverture a former slave and leader in the slave revolt drove out the spanish (from santo domingo) and the british invaders who threatened the colony in the uncertain years of revolution the united states played both sides off against each other with its traders supplying both the french and the rebels{56] the struggle within haiti between the free people of color led by andrxc3xa9 rigaud and the black haitians led by louverture devolved into the war of the knives in 1799 and 1800{57]{58] many surviving free people of color left the island as refugeesbattle between polish troops in french service and the haitian rebelsafter louverture created a separatist constitution napolxc3xa9on bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of 20000 soldiers and as many sailors{59] under the command of his brother-in-law general charles leclerc to retake the island the french achieved some victories but within a few months most of the french had died from yellow fever{60] more than 50000 french troops died in an attempt to retake the colony including 18 generals{61] the french captured louverture transporting him to france for trial he was imprisoned at fort de joux where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly tuberculosis{52]the slaves along with free gens de couleur and allies continued their fight for independence jean-jacques dessalines defeated french troops at the battle of vertixc3xa8res on 18 november 1803 leading the first ever successful slave army revolution in late 1803 france withdrew its remaining 7000 troops from the island and napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a north american empire with the war going

he ordered the massacre of most whites without regard to age or gender those who did not swear allegiance to him were slain{65] in the continuing competition for power he was assassinated by rivals on 17 october 1806{66]only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared: the polish soldiers the majority of whom deserted from the french army and fought alongside the haitian rebels; the little group of german colonists invited to the north-west region; and a group of medical doctors and professionals{67] reportedly people with connections to officers in the haitian army were also spared as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men{68]fearful of the influence of the slaves' revolution us president thomas jefferson refused to recognize the new republic as did most european nations the us did not officially recognize haiti for decades until after the start of the american civil war{69]the revolution led to a wave of emigration{70] in 1809 nearly 10000 refugees from saint-domingue settled en masse in new orleans{71] they doubled the city's population in addition the newly arrived slaves added to the city's african population{72]state of

parts of haiti and extended control over the entire western portion of the island{75] in addition after santo domingo declared its independence from spain on 30 november 1821 boyer sent forces in to take control boyer ruled the entire island with iron rule ending slavery in santo domingo{76] after santo domingo achieved independence from haiti it established a separate national identitystruggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops boyer passed the code rural which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land enter the towns or start farms or shops of their own following the revolution many peasants wanted to have their own farms rather than work on plantations{77]{78]the american colonization society (acs) encouraged free blacks in the united states to emigrate to haiti starting in september 1824 more than 6000 african americans migrated to haiti with transportation paid by the acs{79] many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the united statesin july 1825 king charles x of france during a period of restoration of the monarchy sent a fleet to reconquer the island under pressure president boyer agreed to a treaty by which france formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs by an order of 17 april 1825 the king of france renounced his rights of sovereignty over santo domingo and recognized the independence of haiti{80]{81]{82]though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838 haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947 the haitian president would have had little choice as the country unknowingly to him would have been blockaded by french ships if the exchange did not go the french wayafter losing the support of haiti's elite boyer was ousted in 1843 a long succession of coups followed his departure to exile{citation needed]{83]the enforced payment to france reduced haiti's economy for years western nations did not give haiti formal diplomatic recognition both of these problems kept the haitian economy and society isolated expatriates bankrolled and armed opposing groups{84]second empire (1849xe2x80x931859){edit]main

the reform movement of antxc3xa9nor firmin and in 1897 the germans used gunboat diplomacy to intimidate and then humiliate the haitian government during the luders affairin the first decades of the 20th century haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to france germany and the united states fearing possible foreign intervention president woodrow wilson sent us marines into haiti in december 1914 just after the outbreak of world war i they removed 500000 from the haitian national bank for "safe-keeping" (sic) in new york thus giving the united states control of the bank{85]in an expression of the theodore roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine the united states occupied the island in july 1915 after the assassination of haiti's president vilbrun guillaume sam the pro-american president had been dragged from the french legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed ussxc2xa0washington under rear admiral caperton arrived in port-au-prince to try to restore order and protect american interests this began a nearly 20-year occupation by us forces within days the marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house which controlled all the finances of the island nation the marines declared martial law and severely censored the press within weeks a new pro-american president philippe sudrxc3xa9 dartiguenave had been installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the united states the new constitution included a clause that allowed for the first time foreign ownership of land in haiti which was bitterly opposed by the haitian legislature and citizenrythe next 5 years witnessed numerous cases of intimidation arson torture and murder of the haitian population by us marines and their local enforcers the gendarmerie d'haiti the us marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way mary renda writes that "paternalism was an assertion of authority superiority and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children"{86] this mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in haiti and carry out atrocious acts it has been estimated that up to 15000 haitians lost their lives at the hands of the occupying forces either through armed opposition or through the 'corvee' system of forced labor this system allowed the occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms at gunpoint if necessary to build roads bridges etc many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work camps{87]this chapter in the two nations' histories reflects the oppressive foreign policy of the united states toward its neighbors in central america and the caribbean that is often characterized as "gunboat diplomacy" or one of many "banana wars" that plagued the region in the early 20th century us marines were stationed in the country until 1934 a period of nineteen years and were finally ordered from the island by franklin d roosevelt as a demonstration of his "good neighbor policy" however the united states controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in haiti up through the 1980s{citation needed]sisal was introduced to haiti and sugarcane and cotton became significant exports{88] haitian traditionalists based in rural areas were highly resistant to american-backed changes while the urban elites wanted more control together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934{89] the debts were still outstanding and the american financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941{90]recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the haitian people had an influence on united states writers including eugene o'neill james weldon johnson langston hughes zora neale hurston and orson welles{91]after us forces left in 1934 dominican dictator rafael trujillo used anti-haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool in an event that became known as the parsley massacre he ordered his army to kill haitians living on the dominican side of the border{92]{93] between 10000 and 20000 haitians were killed{92] though he was one-quarter haitian himself trujillo continued policies against the neighboring population for some timeon 27 september 1945{94] haiti became a founding member of the united nations (successor to the league of nations in which haiti was also a founding member){95]{96] in the 1950s american and european tourists started to visit haiti{97]the waterfront area of port-au-prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk from the docks to cultural attractions among these attractions were the moorish-styled iron market where fine haitian art and mahogany were sold in the evenings entrepreneurs provided dancing casino gambling and voodoo shows truman capote and noxc3xabl coward visited the hotel oloffson a 19th-century gothic gingerbread mansion set in a tropical garden which was even portrayed in the graham greene novel the

predominated as the educated urban elite{99] he stayed in power by enlisting an organization known as tontons macoutes ("bogeymen") which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents{100]haiti's brief tourism boom was wiped out by the rule of papa doc duvalier and his unstable government when his son jean-claude "baby doc" duvalier succeeded him as president for life tourism returned in the 1970s{98] vive la diffxc3xa9rence has long been haiti's national tourism slogan{101] and its proximity to the united states made haiti a hot attraction until the duvalier

spent years negotiating with the convergence dxc3xa9mocratique on new elections but the convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractivethe national palace following the 2010 haiti earthquakein 2004 a revolt began in northern haiti the rebellion eventually reached the capital and aristide was forced into exile after which the united nations stationed peacekeepers in haiti some including aristide and his bodyguard franz gabriel stated that he was the victim of a "new coup d'xc3xa9tat or modern kidnapping" by us forces mrs aristide stated that the

there were 331 dead and about 800000 in need of humanitarian aid{112] the state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in april 2008{113]on 12 january 2010 at 4:53pm local time haiti was struck by a magnitude-70 earthquake this was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years{114] the 2010 haiti earthquake was reported to have left up to 316000 people dead and 16 million homeless{115] though later reports found these numbers to have been grossly inflated and put the death toll between 46000 and 85000{116] the country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake and a subsequent and massive haiti cholera outbreak that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a minustah peacekeeping station contaminated the country's main river the artibonite{117] the country has yet to fully recover due to both the severity of the damage haiti endured in 2010 as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake{118]general elections had been planned for january 2010 but were postponed due to the earthquake the elections were held on 28 november 2010 for the senate the parliament and the first round of the presidential elections the run-off between michel martelly and mirlande manigat took place on 20 march 2011 and preliminary results released on 4 april

minister evans paul in power "until an interim president is chosen by both chambers of parliament"{120]in 2013 haiti called for european nations to pay reparations for slavery and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings the economist wrote "any assistance to the region should be carefully targeted; and should surely stem from today's needs not the wrongs of the past"{121] the topic however has more than a passing reference to a country that as lord anthony gifford wrote "was forced to pay compensation to the government of france"{122]on 4 october 2016 hurricane matthew made landfall near les anglais making it the worst hurricane to strike the nation since hurricane cleo in 1964 the storm brought deadly winds and rain which left haiti with a large amount of damage to be repaired with all of the resources in the country destroyed haiti received aid from the united nations of around us120 million the death total was approximately 3000 thousands of people were displaced due to damage to infrastructure also the cholera outbreak has been growing since the storm hit haiti with additional flooding after the storm cholera continued to spread beyond the control of officials the storm also caused damage to hospitals and roads which created a larger problem in helping victims and moving resources the devastation and damage that hurricane

that a worst-case forecast would involve a 72xc2xa0mw earthquake similar in size to the 1692 jamaica earthquake{129] a study team presented a hazard assessment of the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system to the 18th caribbean geologic conference in march 2008 noting the large strain the team recommended "high priority" historical geologic rupture studies as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40xc2xa0years{130] an article published in haiti's le matin newspaper in september 2008 cited comments by geologist patrick charles to the effect that there

yields approximately 30 percent tree cover a stark difference from the often cited 2 percent which has been widely circulated in discourse concerning haiti{134]scientists at the columbia university's center for international earth science information network (ciesin) and the united nations environment programme are working on the haiti regenerative initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty

together constitute the government in 2013 the annual budget was us1 billion{137]legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the national assembly of haiti the government is organized unitarily thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent the current structure of haiti's political system was set forth in the constitution of haiti on 29 march 1987haitian politics have been contentious: since independence haiti has suffered 32 coups{138] haiti is the only country in the western hemisphere to

france the united states and other western countries have repeatedly intervened in haitian politics since the country's founding sometimes at the request of one party or another along with international financial institutions they have imposed large quantities of debt haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending there have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on haiti which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry{139]according to a 2006 report by the corruption perceptions index there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in haiti the nation ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption{140] the international red cross reports that seven out of ten haitians live on less than us2 a daythis statistic was somewhat disputed in a 2006 article about poverty in the slums of haiti (written for the red cross) wherein icrc officer didier revol wrote "such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter for some it is because 'it's none of your business' for others they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them"{141]the commune of citxc3xa9 soleil in port-au-prince has been called "the most dangerous place on earth" by the united nations it is one of the largest slums in the northern hemisphere{142] many of its residents are

aristide was initially denied access to haiti by haitian immigration authorities despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers the world's most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals nor did they support them; an unnamed analyst "close to the haitian government" quoted in several media sourcesxc2xa0xe2x80x93  including the new york timesxc2xa0xe2x80x93  is reported to have said: "aristide could have 15 passports and he's still not going to come back to haitixc2xa0{] france and the united states are standing in the way" however

countries in the world on the corruption perceptions index{163] it is estimated that president "baby doc" duvalier his wife michelle and their agents stole us 504 million from the country's treasury between 1971 and 1986{164] similarly after the haitian army folded in 1995 the haitian national police (hnp) gained sole power of authority on the haitian citizens many haitians as well as observers of the haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force{165]similarly some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president jean-bertrand aristide{166]{167]{168]{169] in march 2004 at the time of aristide's being kidnapped a bbc article wrote that the bush administration state department stated that aristide had been involved in drug trafficking{170] the bbc also described pyramid schemes in which haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002 as the "only real economic initiative" of the aristide years{171]conversely

jamaica (393 per 100000) and nearly xc2xbd that of the dominican republic (221 per 100000) making it among the safer countries in the region{172]{173] in large part this is due to the country's ability to fulfill a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50 a four-year initiative that was started in 2012 in addition to the yearly recruits the haitian national police (hnp) has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime a notable bust in recent years{when?] led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the use of an advanced software program developed by a west point-trained haitian official that proved to be so effective that it has led to its foreign advisers to make inquiries{174]{175]in 2010 the new york city police department (nypd) sent a team of veteran officers to haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth it has also helped the hnp set up a police unit in the center of delmas a neighborhood of port-au-prince{176]{177]{178]in 2012 and 2013 150 hnp officers received specialized training funded by the us government which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by

statistical estimations could be viewed with skepticism because the average haitian and haitian family spends more than that daily{202]the world factbook also states that "remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange equaling one-fifth (20) of gdp and representing more than five times the earnings from exports in 2012"{203] this implies that remittances are the life-blood of the haitian economythe world bank estimates that over 80 of college graduates from haiti were living abroad in 2004{204]haiti's economy was severely impacted by the 2010 haiti earthquake which occurred on 12
