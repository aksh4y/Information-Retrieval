the internal energy depends on pressure as well as on temperature for liquids solids and real gases{5]in the isothermal compression of a gas there is work done on the system to decrease the volume and increase the pressure{4] doing work on the gas increases the internal energy and will tend to increase the temperature to maintain the constant temperature energy must leave the system as heat and enter the environment if the gas is ideal the amount of energy entering the environment is equal to the work done on the gas because internal energy does not change for details of the calculations see calculation of workfor an adiabatic process in which no heat flows into or out of the gas because its container is well insulated qxc2xa0=xc2xa00 if there is also no work done ie a free expansion there is no change in internal energy for an ideal gas this means that the process is also isothermal{4] thus specifying that a process is isothermal is not sufficient to specify a unique processdetails for an ideal gas{edit]figure 1 several isotherms of an ideal gas on a p-v diagramfor the special case of a gas to which boyle's law{4] applies the product pv is a constant if the gas is kept at isothermal conditions the value of the constant is nrt where n is the number of moles of gas present and r is the ideal gas constant in other words the ideal gas law pvxc2xa0=xc2xa0nrt applies{4] this means thatp=nrtv=constantv{displaystyle p={nrt over v}={{ext{constant}} over v}}holds the family of curves generated by this equation is shown in the graph in figure 1 each curve is called an isotherm such graphs are termed indicator diagrams and were first used by james watt and others to monitor the efficiency of engines the temperature corresponding to each curve in the figure increases from the lower left to the upper rightcalculation of work{edit]figure 2 the purple area represents the work for this isothermal changein thermodynamics the reversible work involved when a gas changes from state a to state b is{6]waxe2x86x92b=xe2x88x92xe2x88xabvavbpdv{displaystyle w_{ao b}=-int _{v_{a}}^{v_{b}}pdv}for an isothermal reversible process this integral equals the area under the relevant pressure-volume isotherm and is indicated in purple in figure 2 for an ideal gas again pxc2xa0=xc2xa0nrtv applies and with t being constant (as this is an isothermal process) the expression for work becomes:waxe2x86x92b=xe2x88x92xe2x88xabvavbpdv=xe2x88x92xe2x88xabvavbnrtvdv=xe2x88x92nrtxe2x88xabvavb1vdv=xe2x88x92nrtlnxe2x81xa1vbva{displaystyle w_{ao b}=-int _{v_{a}}^{v_{b}}pdv=-int _{v_{a}}^{v_{b}}{frac {nrt}{v}}dv=-nrtint _{v_{a}}^{v_{b}}{frac {1}{v}}dv=-nrtln {frac {v_{b}}{v_{a}}}}by convention work is defined as the work on the system by its surroundings if for example the system is compressed then the work is positive and the internal energy of the system increases conversely if the system expands it does work on the surroundings and the internal energy of the system decreasesit is also worth noting that for ideal gases if the temperature is held constant the internal energy of the system also is constant and so xcex94uxc2xa0=xc2xa00 since the first law of thermodynamics states that xcex94uxc2xa0=xc2xa0qxc2xa0+xc2xa0w (iupac convention) it follows that qxc2xa0=xc2xa0xe2x88x92w for the isothermal compression or expansion of ideal gasesentropy changes{edit]isothermal processes are especially convenient for calculating changes in entropy since in this case the formula for the entropy change xcex94s is simplyxcex94s=qrevt{displaystyle delta s={frac {q_{ext{rev}}}{t}}}where qrev is the heat transferred reversibly to the system and t is absolute temperature{7] this formula is valid only for a hypothetical reversible process; that is a process in which equilibrium is maintained at all timesa simple example is an equilibrium phase transition (such as melting or evaporation) taking place at constant temperature and pressure for a phase transition at constant pressure the heat transferred to the system is equal to the enthalpy of transformation xcex94htr thus qxc2xa0=xc2xa0xcex94htr{3] at any given pressure there will be a transition temperature ttr for which the two phases are in equilibrium (for example the normal boiling point for vaporization of a liquid at one atmosphere pressure) if the transition takes place under such equilibrium conditions the formula above may be used to directly calculate the entropy change{7]xcex94str=xcex94htrttr{displaystyle delta s_{ext{tr}}={frac {delta h_{ext{tr}}}{t_{ext{tr}}}}}another example is the reversible isothermal expansion (or compression) of an ideal gas from an initial volume va and pressure pa to a final volume vb and pressure pb as shown in calculation of work the heat transferred to the gas isq=xe2x88x92w=nrtlnxe2x81xa1vbva{displaystyle q=-w=nrtln {frac {v_{ext{b}}}{v_{ext{a}}}}}this result is for a reversible process so it may be substituted in the formula for the entropy change to obtain{7]xcex94s=nrlnxe2x81xa1vbva{displaystyle delta s=nrln {frac {v_{ext{b}}}{v_{ext{a}}}}}since an ideal gas obey's boyle's law this can be rewritten if desired asxcex94s=nrlnxe2x81xa1papb{displaystyle delta s=nrln {frac {p_{ext{a}}}{p_{ext{b}}}}}once obtained these formulas can be applied to an irreversible process such as the free expansion of an ideal gas such an expansion is also isothermal and may have the same initial and final states as in the reversible expansion since entropy is a state function the change in entropy of the system is the same as in the reversible process and is given by the formulas above note that the result qxc2xa0=xc2xa00 for the free expansion can not be used in the formula for the entropy change since the process is not reversiblethe difference between the reversible and free expansions is found in the entropy of the surroundings in both cases the surroundings are at a constant temperature t so that xcex94ssurxc2xa0=xc2xa0xe2x88x92qt; the minus sign is used since the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the heat q transferred to the system in the reversible case the change in entropy of the surroundings is equal and opposite to the change in the system so the change in entropy of the universe is zero in the free expansion qxc2xa0=xc2xa00 so the entropy of the surroundings does not change and the change in entropy of the universe is equal to xcex94s for the systemetymology{edit]the adjective "isothermal" is derived from the greek words xe1xbcxb4xcfx83xcexbfxcfx82 (isos) meaning "equal" and xcexb8xcexadxcfx81xcexbcxcexb7 (therme) meaning "heat"see also{edit]joulexe2x80x93thomson effectjoule expansion (also called free expansion)adiabatic processcyclic processisobaric processisochoric processpolytropic processreferences{edit]^ keenan j h (1970) "chapter 12: heat-engine cycles" thermodynamics cambridge ma: mit pressxc2xa0^ rock p a (1983) "chapter 11: thermodynamics of chemical reactions" chemical thermodynamics mill valley ca: university science books isbnxc2xa00-935702-12-1xc2xa0^ a b petrucci r h;
