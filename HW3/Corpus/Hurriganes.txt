popular in finland  estonia in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as a popular live act in sweden during this time their classic line-up consisted of remu aaltonen albert jxc3xa4rvinen and cisse hxc3xa4kkinen the misspelling of the name ("hurriganes" with a "g") is intentional their style of music is very much of a nostalgic pre-beatles roots rock'n'roll orientation during their "classic" period the band's output consisted largely of revved-up cover versions of well-known 1950s rock 'n' roll songs in addition to their own original material in this sense hurriganes can be viewed as finland's answer to british pub rock performers of the 1970s like dave edmunds and dr feelgoodthe founding members were drummer and vocalist henry "remu" aaltonen bassist hugo christer "cisse" hxc3xa4kkinen and guitarist ilkka "ile" kallio kallio temporarily quit the band in the spring of 1972 being replaced by guitarist pekka "albert" jxc3xa4rvinen who was part of the band's most famous

was founded in 1971 in north haaga helsinki where a similar rock band jig-saw played influenced by the name of the north american band johnny and the hurricanes remu aaltonen devised the name for his own band hurriganes practiced in a garage in ohjaajantierock and roll all night long (1972xe2x80x9373){edit]hurriganes' first album rock and roll all night long was released in 1973 it included songs such as "say mama" and "keep on knocking" the album's a-side was recorded in concert klaukkala such as the b-side of the first paragraph but the rest was recorded in the studio this album became the first gold selling record for the band's record label love records{citation needed]roadrunner (1974){edit]hurriganes' commercial high point was with the release of roadrunner in 1974 the album that included the band's more traditional song "get on" which won the international european pop jury competition{citation needed] it also included the songs "roadrunner" "it ain't what you do" "i will stay" and "the phone rang" roadrunner was recorded in stockholm at marcus music studios and the album was also pressed in stockholm roadrunner can be considered as one of the major finnish rock albums roadrunner is still considered one of finnish rock music's most important albums and it is finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time{citation needed] it was finland's best-selling album by a finnish band from 1974 until 1985 when dingo's kerjxc3xa4lxc3xa4isten valtakunta exceeded the volume of sales the album cover art (by risto vuorimies) was the only finnish album cover in 1977's hipgnosisin and roger dean's work album cover album (dragons world book) the cover's stylish motif was chosen by hurriganes' bassist cisse hxc3xa4kkinen who owned a light blue 1954 cadillac series 62 sedan the cover shows the hurriganes' remu aaltonen cisse hxc3xa4kkinen and albert jxc3xa4rvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the cadillac the car ended up in the ownership of kari niiranen or "dj nite" a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with hurriganes roadrunner is regarded as one of the best finnish rock records ever released and in 2007 it was re-released as a sacd mixed to a 51 formatcrazy days: kallio returns (1975){edit]jxc3xa4rvinen left the band in the summer of 1975 and ile kallio returned to the band after a break of three years after roadrunner the band's popularity was at its highest and not until the late 1970s did new wave and rockabilly genres succeed in prying hurriganes from their spot as number one on the finnish band scene although in hurriganes' early career hullujussi also momentarily stole some acclaim in the neighboring country of sweden the band was a popular live performer well into the 1980s and broke the concert venue folkpark's record in audience numbers several times the same in 1975 when hurriganes released the album crazy days which reached diamond disk status quickly but never did beat the roadrunner album in terms of sales crazy days contained one major hit originally released by jim  the beatmakers in 1964: "my only one" which had long been on hurriganes's concert repertoire a song sung by cisse in a bravura performance until the end the album also covered the lennon-mccartney composition "bad to me"hot wheels (1976){edit]after crazy days hot wheels's sound was rawer and heavier than its predecessor this album differs from its predecessors in that it contains only remu's and cisse's names marked with their own songs ile also took part in the songwriting but remu deliberately left out the name of the data element the album was recorded in lahti by pekka nurmi at microvox studio which was a cheap seedy and not very classy basement studio in sweden hot wheels was a real breakthrough and their albums are at least equal in importance to roadrunner familiar songs from the album such as the title track "hot wheels" was heard in 1976-produced low-budget film hot guys hot wheels the film does not have any particular plot and it is monitored by girls and boys who end up on a date hurriganes concert on the side the video shows remu cisse and ile and spending their free time including playing football the movie was directed by john itkonen and it aptly describes life in the 1970s hurriganes members played themselves in the movietsugu way and hanger (1977xe2x80x9378){edit]love records' own brand new studio recorded tsugu way (1977) making harassing technical problems but the content was familiar with some hurriganes covers among other things borrowed from the beatles' "hold me tight" the album was released in sweden germany and the netherlands as the "use well hooks" gold standard of the album was easily reached even if the sale of a recession in finland during the downward directionin november 1977 hurriganes swedish sonet label the band held a small tour in london the next summer it was agreed 30 gigs in europe status quo warm-up london however failed to conquer and quo gigs were canceled when the remu and cisse went back to finland among the tour the reason was apparently the fact that the band was unknown in england and arrangements for the reception for example they were headlining major gigs as remu states "i fucked up to the whole system so we went away"{citation needed]at this moment ile's last hurriganes album was hanger where the drummer beaver aittojxc3xa4rvi-oja performed and keyboardist jim pembroke remu's back problems prevented him from playing and short-lived remains of five people hurriganes went on tour to the swedish but the reception was a little contradictory the concerts' drummer was tomi parkkonenkallio changed again to jxc3xa4rvinen (1979xe2x80x931981) failure of the british
