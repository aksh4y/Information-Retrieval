b'typhoon - wikipedia typhoonfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchthis article is about northwestern pacific tropical cyclones for other uses see typhoon (disambiguation)for other areas in which tropical cyclones occur see tropical cyclone basinsthree different tropical cyclones spinning over the western pacific ocean on august 7 2006 (maria bopha saomai) the cyclone on the lower right has intensified into a typhoona typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180xc2xb0 and 100xc2xb0e in the northern hemisphere this region is referred to as the northwestern pacific basin{1] and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on earth accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones for organizational purposes the northern pacific ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (north america to 140xc2xb0w) central (140xc2xb0 to 180xc2xb0w) and western (180xc2xb0 to 100xc2xb0e) the regional specialized meteorological center (rsmc) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in japan with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest pacific in hawaii (the joint typhoon warning center) the philippines and hong kong while the rsmc names each system the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year only the philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country{citation needed]a typhoon differs from a cyclone or hurricane only on the basis of location{2] a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean{2]within the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms do occur between december and may (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time) on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of japan the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with china and japan being impacted slightly less some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck

is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic{4] elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic storm{5]the oxford english dictionary{6] cites urdu xe1xb9xadxc5xabfxc4x81n and chinese tai fung giving rise to several early forms in english the earliest forms -- "touffon" later "tufan" "tuffon" and others -- derive from urdu xe1xb9xadxc5xabfxc4x81n with citations as early as 1588 from 1699 appears "tuffoon" later "tiffoon" derived from chinese with spelling influenced by the older urdu-derived forms the modern spelling "typhoon" dates to 1820 preceded by "tay-fun" in 1771 and "ty-foong" all derived from the chinese tai fungthe urdu source word xd8xaaxd9x88xd9x81xd8xa7xd9x86 xe1xb9xadxc5xabfxc4x81n ("violent storm"; cognate to hindi xe0xa4xa4xe0xa5x82xe0xa4xabxe0xa4xbcxe0xa4xbexe0xa4xa8 (txc5xabfxc4x81n)){7] comes via persian from arabic xd8xb7xd9x88xd9x81xd8xa7xd9x86 (xe1xb9xadxc5xabfxc4x81n) which may derive from the verb txc5xabfxc4xabdan (persian: xd8xaaxd9x88xd9x81xdbx8cxd8xafxd9x86xd8xb7xd9x88xd9x81xdbx8cxd8xafxd9x86xe2x80x8exe2x80x8e "to roar to blow furiously"){citation needed] or arabic xe1xb9xadxc4x81fa to turn round{6]the chinese source is the word tai fung{7] (simplified chinese: xe5x8fxb0xe9xa3x8e; traditional chinese: xe9xa2xb1xe9xa2xa8; pinyin: txc3xa1ifxc4x93ng) cited as a common dialect form of mandarin dxc3xa0 "big" and fxc4x93ng "wind"{6] in mandarin the word for the windstorm is xe5xa4xa7xe9xa3x8e (dxc3xa0fxc4x93ng "big wind") and in cantonese xe5xa4xa7xe9xa2xa8 (daai6 fung1 "big wind") the modern japanese word xe5x8fxb0xe9xa2xa8 (xe3x81x9fxe3x81x84xe3x81xb5xe3x81x86 taifuu) is also derived from chinese the first character is normally used to mean "pedestal" or "stand" but is actually a simplification of the older kanji xe9xa2xb1 which means "typhoon"; thus the word originally meant "typhoon wind"the ancient greek xcexa4xcfx85xcfx86xe1xbfxb6xcexbd (tuphxc3xb4n typhon) is not unrelated and has secondarily contaminated the word{7] the persian and chinese terms may have been originated by the greek word in the first place{6]{8]intensity

the japan meteorological agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots (38xc2xa0mph; 61xc2xa0kmh){9] a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots (39xc2xa0mph; 63xc2xa0kmh) tropical storms also receive official names from rsmc tokyo{9] should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots (55xc2xa0mph; 89xc2xa0kmh) then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm{9] once the system's maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots (74xc2xa0mph; 119xc2xa0kmh) the jma will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoonxe2x80x94the highest category on its scale{9]from 2009 the hong kong observatory started to further divide typhoons into three different classifications: typhoon severe typhoon and super typhoon{10] a typhoon has wind speed of 64-79 knots (73-91xc2xa0mph; 118xe2x80x93149xc2xa0kmh) a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots (92xc2xa0mph; 150xc2xa0kmh) and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots (120xc2xa0mph; 190xc2xa0kmh){10] the united states' joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130xc2xa0knots (67xc2xa0ms; 150xc2xa0mph; 241xc2xa0kmh)xe2x80x94the equivalent of a strong categoryxc2xa04 storm in the saffir-simpson scalexe2x80x94as super typhoons{11] however the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the jtwc uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period akin to the us' national hurricane center and central pacific hurricane center as a result the jtwc's wind reports are higher than jma's measurements as the latter are based on a 10-minute averaging interval{12]genesis{edit]depth of 26xc2xa0xc2xb0c isotherm on october 1 2006see also: tropical cyclogenesisthere are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form normally an ocean temperature of 265xc2xa0xc2xb0c (797xc2xa0xc2xb0f) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres (160xc2xa0ft) is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone{citation needed] these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems a minimum distance of 500xc2xa0km (300xc2xa0mi) from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis{13]whether it be a depression in the intertropical convergence zone (itcz) or monsoon trough a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis about 85 to 90xc2xa0percent of pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough{14] even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low vertical wind shear of less than 10xc2xa0ms (20xc2xa0kn 33xc2xa0fts) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development{13] typically with pacific typhoons there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the westerlies and a second towards the equator{14]in general westerly wind increases associated with the maddenxe2x80x93julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season{15] on average twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western pacific ocean near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south along the same meridian or line of longitude{16] there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the maddenxe2x80x93julian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time{17]frequency{edit]storm frequencytropical storms and typhoons by monthfor the period 1959xe2x80x932015 (northwest

within the western pacific this makes this basin the most active on earth{19] pacific typhoons have formed year round with peak months from august to october the peak months correspond to that of the atlantic hurricane seasons along with a high storm frequency this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record one of the most recent busy seasons was 2013 tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest pacific ocean and concentrate around june and november in the northern indian ocean the area just northeast of the philippines is the most active place on earth for tropical cyclones to exist across the philippines themselves activity reaches a minimum in february before increasing steadily through june and spiking from july through october with september being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago activity falls off significantly in november although typhoon haiyan the strongest philippine typhoon on record was a november typhoon{20] the most frequently impacted areas of the philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central luzon and eastern visayas{21] a ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30xc2xa0percent of the annual rainfall in the northern philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones while the southern islands receive less than 10xc2xa0percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones{22] the genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency{23]paths{edit]see also: hurricane belttracks of all tropical cyclones in the northernwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 the vertical line to the right is the international date linemost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the westerlies{24] when the subtropical ridge shifts due to el nixc3xb1o so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience many fewer septemberxe2x80x93november tropical cyclone impacts during el nixc3xb1o and neutral years during el nixc3xb1o years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130xc2xb0e which would favor the japanese archipelago{25] during la nixc3xb1a years the formation of tropical cyclones and the subtropical ridge position shift westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and greater intensity to philippines{25] those that form near the marshall islands find their way to jeju island korea{26]typhoon paths follow three general directions{19]straight track (or straight runner) a general westward path affects the philippines southern china taiwan and vietnama parabolic recurving track storms recurving affect eastern philippines eastern china taiwan korea japan and the russian far eastnorthward track from point of origin the storm follows a northerly direction only affecting small islandsa rare few storms like hurricane john were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the easterncentral pacific and moved into the western pacificbasin monitoring{edit]within the western pacific rsmc tokyo-typhoon center part of the japan meteorological agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 1989{27] and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000{10] however each national meteorological and hydrological service within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies{28] the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration (pagasa) for interests in the island archipelago nation{29] and the hong kong observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals{30]name sources{edit]the list of names consists of entries from 17 southeast and east asian nations and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into five lists and each list is cycled with each year unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however pagasa retains its own naming list which does consist of human names{31] therefore a typhoon can possibly have two names storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon in japan people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year{27]records{edit]totalstormsyeartropicalstormstyphoonssupertyphoons39196413197351965196719711415111016161144341994141463319961215632197416160311989199220131013181517865530196219661972199020047108910171720171363247the most active western pacific typhoon season was in 1964{citation needed] when 39xc2xa0storms of tropical storm strength formed only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began the least activity seen in the northwest pacific ocean was during the 2010 pacific typhoon season when only 14xc2xa0tropical storms and seven typhoons formed in the philippines the most active season since 1945 for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country{32] there was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the philippines in 1958{33] the 2004 pacific typhoon season was the busiest for okinawa since 1957{34] within guangdong in southern china during the past thousand years the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s{35]the highest reliably-estimated maximum sustained winds on record for a typhoon were those of typhoon haiyan at 195 miles per hour (314xc2xa0kmh) shortly before its landfall in the central philippines on nov 8 2013{36] the most intense storm based on minimum pressure was typhoon tip in the northwestern pacific ocean in 1979 which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals (26xc2xa0inhg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165xc2xa0knots (85xc2xa0ms 190xc2xa0mph 310xc2xa0kmh){37] the deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was typhoon nina which killed nearly 100000 in china in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail{38] after typhoon morakot landed in taiwan at midnight on august 8 2009 almost the entire southern region of taiwan (chiayi countychiayi city tainan countytainan city (now merged as tainan) kaohsiung countykaohsiung city (now merged as kaohsiung) and pingtung county) and parts of taitung county and nantou county were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain the rainfall in pingtung county reached 2327 millimeters (916xc2xa0in){39] breaking all rainfall records of any single place in taiwan induced by a single typhoon{40] and
