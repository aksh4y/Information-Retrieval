career{edit]2004xe2x80x9305: early career{edit]when natalie horler was 17 she was doing studio work for various djs eventually she met yanou and dj manian originally they released music under the name cascade but due to kaskade another artist with a similar name threatening legal action they changed it to cascada{4] they simultaneously released music under the names of siria and akira as well but ended those projects due to the success of cascada under andorfine records they produced their debut and hit single "miracle" and its follow-up "bad boy" in germany{5] this caught the attention of the american dance label robbins entertainment they negotiated a contract and "miracle" was released in 2004 however it did not attract much attention so cascada offered them "everytime we touch"2005xe2x80x9307: everytime we touch{edit]cascada experienced mainstream success in the united kingdom and the united states almost a year after releasing their second american single "everytime we touch" which interpolates the chorus of a 1992 maggie reilly song of the same name{6]{7] the song gained platinum and gold certifications across the globe being certified platinum by the riaa{8]{9] soon after the popularity of the single skyrocketed an album was recorded and released in a matter of months{10] and a music video for "everytime we touch" was also distributed for promotion{11]a total of eight singles were released from the album four of which have been released in the united kingdom: "everytime we touch" "truly madly deeply" (originally by savage garden)"miracle" and "a neverending dream" (originally by x-perience) all of which gained top 10 status apart from "a neverending dream" which charted at 46{12] the us saw the re-release of "miracle" shortly after "everytime we touch"'s breakthrough receiving high radio rotation and reaching the lower ends of the us charts{13] their album everytime we touch has experienced success in the uk album chart where it remained up in the top forty for twenty-four weeks peaking at 2{14]{15] the album experienced success on the us charts as well{16] the success of the album gained them two world music award nominations winning them world's best-selling german artist{17] additionally the album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide2007xe2x80x9309: perfect day{edit]horler first announced that cascada were working on their

smith's "because the night" and the jeffrey steele song "what hurts the most" as well as two tracks "endless summer" and "i will believe it" that were previously recorded by horler and dj manian under the discontinued siria name{19] however the us release replaced the siria songs{20] p!nk and avril lavigne covers with three newer tracks because they did not have the north american rights two of these songs were "faded" a cover of a kate dearaugo song and "holiday" a cover of a jenny may song{21] the second album was released at the end of 2007 in the uk and several parts of northern europe{22] perfect day was released to the remaining markets in the first quarter of 2008 with the us release being the last{23] horler also stated in a french interview before the release that she
