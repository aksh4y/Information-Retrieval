a small unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) designed to collect weather data including temperature atmospheric pressure humidity and wind measurements over oceans and remote areas the aerosonde was developed by insitu and is now manufactured by aerosonde ltd which is a strategic business of aai corporation the aerosonde is powered by a modified enya r120 model aircraft engine and carries on board a small computer meteorological instruments and a gps receiver for navigation it is also used by the united states armed forces for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (isr)contents1

phase 1 aerosonde nicknamed "laima" after the ancient latvian deity of good fortune completed a 2031 mile (3270xc2xa0km) flight across the atlantic ocean this was the first crossing of the atlantic ocean by a uav; at the time it was also the smallest aircraft ever to cross the atlantic{1] (the smallest aircraft record was subsequently broken by the spirit of butts farm uav) launched from a roof rack of a moving car due to its lack of undercarriage laima flew from newfoundland canada to benbecula an island off the coast of scotland in 26xc2xa0hours 45xc2xa0minutes in stormy weather using approximately 15 us gallons (125 imperial gallons or 57 litres) of gasoline (petrol) other than for take-off and landing the flight was autonomous without external control at an altitude of 5500xc2xa0ft (1680xc2xa0meters) aerosondes have also been the first unmanned aircraft to penetrate tropical cyclones with an initial mission in 2001{2] followed by eye penetrations in 2005{3]operational history{edit]on 5 march 2012 the us special operations command (socom) awarded aai a contract to provide the aerosonde-g for their mid-endurance uas ii program the catapult-launched air vehicle has a takeoff weight 39 or 55xc2xa0lb (18 or 25xc2xa0kg) depending on engine type with endurance of over 10 hours and an electro-opticinfrared and laser-pointer payload{4] the aerosonde has been employed by socom and us naval air systems command (navair) under the designation mq-19 under service provision contracts a typical system comprises four air vehicles and two ground control stations that are accommodated in tents or tailored to fit in most vehicles the system can also include remote video terminals for individual users to uplink new navigation waypoints and sensor commands to and receive sensor imagery and video from the vehicle from a ruggedized tablet device originally the aerosonde suffered from engine-reliability issues but textron says it has rectified those issues{5]by november 2015 textron systems was performing aerosonde operations in "eight or nine" countries for its users including the us marine corps us air force and socom as well as for commercial users consisting of a customer in the oil and gas industry instead of buying hardware customers pay for "sensor hours" and the company decides how many aircraft are produced to meet requirements 4000 fee-for-service hours were being performed monthly and the aerosonde had exceeded 110000 flight hours in service{6]variants{edit]this section is empty you can help by adding to it
