seasonhurricane marilyn was the fifteenth tropical depression and thirteenth named storm of the unusually busy 1995 atlantic hurricane season following closely on the heels of hurricane luis hurricane marilyn was the most powerful storm to hit the virgin islands since hurricane hugo of 1989marilyn formed late in the utc day on september 13 and reached hurricane strength soon thereafter marilyn struck the lesser antilles on september 14 at categoryxc2xa01 strength and intensified to nearly categoryxc2xa03 strength by the time it reached the us virgin islands a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones after heading north past bermuda marilyn weakened and became extratropical on september 22 the remnant circulation wandered the atlantic ocean from september 23 xe2x80x93 october 1 just south of nova scotia marilyn peaked at 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) but was predicted to reach 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) (maximum categoryxc2xa03-status)marilyn is directly responsible for thirteen deaths most due to drowning on boats or offshore eleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of st thomas and estimated damages were set at 2xc2xa0billion (1995xc2xa0usd){1] in the usvi the same area would be struck by hurricane bertha the next year while still repairing from hurricanes luis and marilyn{2] then

to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalemarilyn's origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the african coast on september 7 large low-level winds were included in the wave's circulation but little convection existed{3] the system continued west for a few days at about 19xc2xa0mph (31xc2xa0kmh) next to an anticyclonic aloft on september 12 satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it tropical depression fifteen after convection had increased tropical depression fifteen strengthened rapidly becoming tropical storm marilyn six hours later one day after being named marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status while turning on a more northwesterly track{3]{4]for the next few days marilyn's track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge marilyn was a category 1 hurricane; it passed 52xc2xa0mi (84xc2xa0km) north of barbados and martinique{3] marilyn passed over dominica and just xc3x8eles des saintes and southwest of guadeloupe on september 14 bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it marilyn continued on its northwesterly track making landfall in the us virgin islands on september 15 packing winds of 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) a strong categoryxc2xa02 strength hurricane the eyewall east-southeast of the center of marilyn passed over saint thomas later that day after passing over puerto rico marilyn entered back into the atlantic ocean on september 16{3]hurricane marilyn near puerto ricoa low had formed near marilyn which may have enhanced outflow from the system an eye formed in the center of marilyn and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of only 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) a lower-end categoryxc2xa03 hurricane at this time marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120xe2x80x93125xc2xa0mph (190xe2x80x93195xc2xa0kmh){5]{6]{7]{8] reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima marilyn started weakening rapidly falling from peak-level winds of 141xc2xa0mph (227xc2xa0kmh) down to 102xc2xa0mph (164xc2xa0kmh){3] the central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only 10xc2xa0hours this rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system a decaying eyewall and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm hurricane luis as marilyn weakened to category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest it passed about 174xc2xa0mi (280xc2xa0km) west of bermuda on september 19 as marilyn encountered more westerly shear it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on september 20 centered in the northeastern atlantic{3] the remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central atlantic ocean for another 10xc2xa0days before being absorbed by a frontal low on september 30a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones{3]preparations{edit]hurricane marilyn on crossing the virgin islands on september 15 1995seventeen watches andor warnings were issued in association with marilyn{3] the first two were a tropical storm watch and a tropical storm warning issued on barbados st vincent grenadines st lucia and grenada on september 12 at 2200 utc five hours later a tropical storm watch was issued for trinidad and tobago a tropical storm warning was issued for st lucia st vincent grenadines grenada and tobago at 900 utc september 13{9]{10] at 2100 utc a hurricane warning was issued for barbados st vincent grenadines st lucia and a hurricane watch for dominica{3]{11] a hurricane watch as released for martinique on september 14 the 2100 utc september 13 was extended for the grenadines through st martin except guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin at 1500 utc puerto rico was put under a hurricane watch{3]{12] at 1700 utc guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane watch four hours later puerto rico us and british virgin islands and guadeloupe were put under a hurricane warning{3]throughout the night several watches and warnings were discontinued at 1500 utc september 15 dominican republic from cabrera to cabo engano were put under a hurricane watch as marilyn approached during the night of september 16 all currently active watches and warnings were discontinued at around the same time a new hurricane watch was released for turks and caicos and mayaguana acklins and the crooked islands of the southeastern bahamas{8]{13]{14]{15] this warning was discontinued within 48xc2xa0hours at 1500 utc september 18 bermuda came under a tropical storm watch which was upgraded to a warning in six hours the warning was discontinued on september 19{3]{16]{17]{18]{19]{20]the 250000 residents of barbados spent the night of september 13 in shelters{21]impact{edit]impact by country or regioncountyregiondeathsdamagesourcest

13xc2xa0deaths throughout the united states virgin islands and puerto rico the exact figure for damages in the us virgin islands and puerto rico is not available although the american insurance services group set the combined damage at 875xc2xa0million aside from high winds and seas one possible explanation for the storm's heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations marilyn followed on the heels of luis a more powerful category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to st thomas this prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre-storm preparations; however luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage virgin islanders questioned the accuracy of the national hurricane center wind advisories as hurricane marilyn caused significant damage for a mere "category 2" storm damage on st thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on st croix in 1989 when hurricane hugo a category 4 storm caused catastrophic damage because st thomas is a very hilly island it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills (some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level) were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods{3]martinique{edit]rainfalls in martinique peaked at 906xc2xa0in (230xc2xa0mm) in morne rouge 894xc2xa0in (227xc2xa0mm) in ajoupa bouillon 64xc2xa0in (160xc2xa0mm) in saint pierre ranging

including the hospital and the water desalination plant; five people were killed storm surge in the charlotte amalie harbor beached the uscgc point ledge and damaged many smaller boats{29] elsewhere

last of three tropical cyclones to affect the leeward islands especially dominica and guadeloupe in a short period of time of the 1995 season the first being hurricane iris late august and the second being hurricane luis ten days beforedue to intense destruction in the us virgin islands the name marilyn was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane
