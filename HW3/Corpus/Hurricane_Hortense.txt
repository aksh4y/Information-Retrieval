hurricane seasonhurricane hortense was the first hurricane to make landfall in guadeloupe and puerto rico since hurricane hugo in 1989 the eighth tropical cyclone eighth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season hortense developed on septemberxc2xa03 from a tropical wave in the central atlantic oceaninitially a tropical depression it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper-level winds while nearing the lesser antilles upper-level winds decreased allowing the depression to become tropical storm hortense on septemberxc2xa07 hortense crossed guadeloupe on septemberxc2xa08 and entered the caribbean sea by on the following day it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward hortense made landfall in puerto rico on septemberxc2xa09 and brushed the dominican republic shortly thereafterafter re-entering the atlantic hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa04 hurricane early on septemberxc2xa013 thereafter the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward early on septemberxc2xa015 hortense made landfall in nova scotia as a minimal categoryxc2xa01 hurricane it quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the atlantic to the south of newfoundland late on septemberxc2xa015 hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about 24xc2xa0hours laterthe storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the lesser antilles on guadeloupe damage was most significant to crops with over 50 of banana plantains destroyed localized flooding was reported on martinique impact was most significant in puerto rico across the island 11463xc2xa0houses were severely damaged about 14xc2xa0million people on puerto rico were left without electricity xe2x80x93 equivalent to about 40 of the island's population damage in puerto rico was estimated at 1534xc2xa0million (1996xc2xa0usd) there were also 19xc2xa0deaths most of which due to drowning during flash floods in the dominican republic strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses and downed several power lines flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80 of crops in samanxc3xa1 province at least three fatalities were confirmed in that country the storm brought strong winds to the bahamas and turks and caicos islands and lesser winds to bermudalater in its duration hortense struck nova scotia bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations there were many power outages trees blown down roofs torn away and roads damaged in the province new brunswick newfoundland and prince edward island were also impacted though not as severely as in nova scotia damage in atlantic canada reached approximately 364xc2xa0millioncontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 lesser antilles32

scalea tropical wave and a broad low-pressure area associated with it exited the west coast of africa near dakar senegal on augustxc2xa030 the low-pressure area which had deepened to 1005xc2xa0mbar (297xc2xa0inhg) by augustxc2xa031 moved south of cape verde although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery the system possessed a well-defined low- to mid-level circulation after crossing several national oceanic and atmospheric administration buoys early on septemberxc2xa03 it was determined that the system developed into tropical depression eight at 1200xc2xa0utc on that same day while located about halfway between cape verde and the lesser antilles under the influence of strong high pressure ridge the depression tracked almost due westward without significant intensification convection remained sporadic and disorganized with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on septemberxc2xa06 while nearing the leeward islands upper-level winds reduced to a favorable level causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increase{1]hurricane hortense making landfall in puerto rico on september 10at 0600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa07 the depression had intensified into tropical storm hortense a reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of 71xc2xa0mph (114xc2xa0kmh) confirming the storm was strengthening early on septemberxc2xa08 hortense struck guadeloupe with winds of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) shortly thereafter intensification slowed due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern caribbean sea convection diminished with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed the short-wave soon left the area causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re-developedby early on septemberxc2xa09 hortense was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward around 0600xc2xa0utc on the following day the storm made landfall near guxc3xa1nica puerto rico with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh);{1] this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since hurricane hugo in 1989 initially most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the dominican republic{2] after two hours hortense emerged into the mona passage and brushed the eastern tip of dominican republic; punta cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on septemberxc2xa010 land interaction with hispaniola weakened the storm slightly though it would soon re-strengthen{1]while tracking east of turks and caicos islands on septemberxc2xa011 hortense became a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane and then to a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane by early on the following day continuing to intensify hortense reached categoryxc2xa04 intensity on septemberxc2xa012 around that time a developing trough centered over the eastern united states caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate at 0000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa013 hortense attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935xc2xa0mbar (276xc2xa0inhg)after maintaining categoryxc2xa04 intensity for 24xc2xa0hours the storm weakened back to a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane while passing well east of bermuda hortense was downgraded to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane early on septemberxc2xa014 later that day the storm weakened further to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane early on septemberxc2xa015 hortense made its final landfall near west quoddy nova scotia with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) hortense weakened over nova scotia and was a tropical storm when it re-emerged into the atlantic less than nine hours after landfall by 1800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa015 hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of newfoundland the storm's remnants merged with a frontal system on the following day{1]preparations{edit]shortly after hortense intensified into a tropical storm a tropical storm warning was issued by the respective governments from martinique to the united states virgin islands late on septemberxc2xa07 about 57xc2xa0hours before the hurricane's puerto rico landfall a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico;{1] however the watch was discontinued at 1500xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa08 after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region{2] at the same time a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the british and united states virgin islands 12xc2xa0hours earlier at 1500xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa09xc2xa0xe2x80x93 about fifteen hours before landfallxc2xa0xe2x80x93 a hurricane warning was issued in puerto rico{1] the downgrade of the warning on the island led residents to underestimate the hurricane's threat{2] before hortense struck puerto rico the local national weather service office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) with higher totals in the mountains{1]late on septemberxc2xa09 a hurricane warning was issued for portions of eastern dominican republic which was eventually extended along the country's northern coastline a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the north coast of haiti to st nicolas on septemberxc2xa010 a hurricane warning was issued for the turks and caicos islands and for the bahamas islands of inagua and mayaguana; a hurricane watch was also issued for the central bahamas{1]impact{edit]wettest tropical

125xc2xa0in (320xc2xa0mm) both la dxc3xa9sirade and pointe-xc3xa0-pitre international airport observed 81xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) wind gusts and sustained winds of 53xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh){1]{8] the storm caused significant crop damage destroying roughly over 50 percent of the banana plantain{9]{10] further south heavy rains led to scattered flooding in martinique{11] which inundated streets while strong winds knocked down power lines{12] one man who attempted to drive across a flooded road was rescued from his vehicle seconds before it was swept away{13]while hortense passed south of saint croix the storm produced sustained winds of 39xc2xa0mph (63xc2xa0kmh) at henry e rohlsen airport with unofficial gusts to 62xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh){14] hortense dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 180xc2xa0in (460xc2xa0mm) in christiansted{15] the rains flooded low-lying areas of frederiksted on nearby saint thomas the storm dropped 70xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) of rainfall with gusts reaching only 30xc2xa0mph (48xc2xa0kmh){14]greater antilles{edit]flooding caused by hortense near guayama puerto ricoas hortense approached puerto rico the eastern half of the circulation had a concentrated area of thunderstorms{14] while the hurricane crossed the southwest portion of the island it dropped heavy rainfall of over 10xc2xa0in (250xc2xa0mm) in much of the territory's eastern half totals ranged from below 1xc2xa0in (25xc2xa0mm) near where the storm moved ashore to a peak of 235xc2xa0in (600xc2xa0mm) near cayey{15] three stations broke their 12xe2x80x93hour rainfall records and two stations broke their 24xe2x80x93hour rainfall records; the highest 24xe2x80x93hour total was 195xc2xa0in (500xc2xa0mm) in las piedras the rainfall caused widespread flash flooding and increased river discharge; a station along the rxc3xado grande de loxc3xadza in san lorenzo reported a 1 in 100 year flow rate rivers and creeks across the region reached high peaks{14] and there were several reports of mudslides{1] sustained winds on the island peaked at 46xc2xa0mph (74xc2xa0kmh) in ceiba and gusts reached 62xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) in carolina{14] an unofficial wind gust of 109xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) in the southwest portion of the island may have been caused by the venturi effect or an acceleration of winds between walls{1] along the southern puerto rico coast hortense caused coastal flooding and beach erosion{14]an overflown river near san juan flooded several homes across the island hortense left about 13xc2xa0million people without power and 11xc2xa0million customers without water during the storm 10563xc2xa0people evacuated to storm shelters{14] across the island 11463xc2xa0houses were severely damaged by hortense{1] the hurricane left 1284xc2xa0million in crop damage primarily to coffee plantains and bananas there was another 25xc2xa0million from road damage there were 19xc2xa0deaths on the island many of whom due to flash flood drownings{14] some 1400000xc2xa0people about 40 of the population lost power during and after the storm straining the cleanup effort in the following days and weeks with lack of air conditioning and spoiled food{16]flooding in puerto ricowhile hortense was near the eastern tip of the dominican republic punta cana reported sustained winds of 92xc2xa0mph (148xc2xa0kmh) which was the highest land wind report associated with the hurricane puerto plata along the northern coast also reported hurricane-force winds high winds destroyed a school and church damaged several houses and downed several power lines like its effects in puerto rico hortense dropped heavy rainfall in the dominican republic peaking at 1925xc2xa0in (489xc2xa0mm) in san rafael del yuma while passing the region the hurricane produced a 9xc2xa0ft (27xc2xa0m) storm surge the combination of the surge and heavy rainfall produced flooding that closed roadways hortense damaged 80 of the crops in samanxc3xa1 in the country the hurricane killed three people and left 21xc2xa0missing{1]elsewhere{edit]on grand turk island wind gusts reached 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) while hortense passed nearby; the same station reported sustained winds of 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh){1]the bahamas threatened by their second major hurricane in two weeks fared well from the storm with little damage and no casualties{16]in bermuda a sustained wind speed of 34xc2xa0mph (55xc2xa0kmh) and a gust to 48xc2xa0mph (77xc2xa0kmh) were measured on septemberxc2xa013; slightly lesser winds were reported the following day the storm also brought rainfall to the island though total amounts are unknown{17]{18]in nova scotia hortense dropped heavy rainfall and caused strong winds causing power outages uprooted trees and moderate structural damage amounting to 3xc2xa0million (1996 usd){19] rainfall was light on prince edward island with the highest observed being 17 inches (43xc2xa0mm) in charlottetown strong winds were reported throughout the province gusts reached 52xc2xa0mph (84xc2xa0kmh) in charlottetown and 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) elsewhere the winds downed power lines leaving numerous residents without electricity especially in charlottetown east point montague murray river souris effects were almost nil in new brunswick limited to rainfall peaking at 21 inches (53xc2xa0mm) though most of it was a storm system that preceded hortense's passage sustained winds in the province were light reaching about 27xc2xa0mph (43xc2xa0kmh)aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane nameson
