puerto rico bermuda parts of the northeastern usa newfoundlandpart of the 1995 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane luis was a long-lived and an extremely destructive cape verde-type hurricane as well as one of the strongest deadliest and most notable hurricanes of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season with maximum sustained winds of 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season the storm was the twelfth tropical storm sixth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season at one point the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the atlantic basin along with humberto iris and karen the storm lasted for 14xc2xa0days as a tropical storm between late august and nearly middle septemberthe system initially formed from a tropical wave south of cape verde islands west of africa on august 27 then subsequently attained tropical storm status on august 29 two days later that day the storm reached hurricane status; shortly thereafter it rapidly strengthened into a 140xc2xa0mph (220xc2xa0kmh) category 4 hurricane{1] at this strength it affected much of the leeward islands on september 4 to september 6 throughout the following days luis gradually weakened as it accelerated safely to the west of bermuda as a category 1 hurricane luis made landfall on newfoundland before it became extratropical on september 11it caused catastrophic damage in antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin and anguilla as a category 4 with winds of 130xc2xa0mph (209xc2xa0kmh) the storm accounted for 19 deaths left between 20000 and 70000 homeless (mostly in antigua barbuda and saint martin) and caused roughly 3 billion (1995xc2xa0usd) in damage across the affected areas hurricane luis was the most devastating hurricane to strike the northern leeward islands in the 20th century and one of the strongest storms to hit the leeward islands at the time along with hurricane david in 1979 and hurricane hugo in 1989 additionally luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect guadeloupe in a short period of time the first being hurricane iris a week before and the last being hurricane marilyn only ten days afterward the next year the leeward islands would be struck by hurricane bertha while still repairing from luis and marilyn then successively

intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of hurricane luis trace back to an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 26 a low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak surface low on august 27; consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named "luis" on august 29 though convective activity fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby wind shear the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an eye to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later{1]tropical storms karen (left) and luis (right) on augustxc2xa029hurricane luis continued to strengthen as it tracked west-northwestward into a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on september 2 and the cyclone turned more towards the west earlier that day as it maintained a rectilinear slow motion on september 3 a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the storm that reached category 4 status earlier peaked with 140xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) and maintained it for two days and a half at this time it was located approximately 540 miles (870xc2xa0km) to the east of the lesser antilles as a result the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a subtropical ridge due to the absorption of karen by the stronger iris{1]by the day of september 4 luis sustained a large wind field as it approach the lesser antilles its tropical storm-force winds measured from 345xc2xa0mi (555xc2xa0km) to 365xc2xa0mi (587xc2xa0km) in diameter as it begin to affected in the night antigua barbuda dominica and guadeloupe on the morning of september 5 islands such as dominica and even the islands of guadeloupe where it experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of grande-terre and dxc3xa9sirade has been relatively spared by the storm however the eyewall of the hurricane skimed antigua and directly passing over barbuda while weakened slightly during the time it proceeded slowly northwestward affecting montserrat saint kitts and nevis sint eustatius and saba causing moderate damage later luis moved along st barthelemy st martin and ultimately crossed anguilla where maximum sustained winds within the eyewall were estimated to have reached 135xc2xa0mph (217xc2xa0kmh) and its central pressure had dropped from 945 to 942xc2xa0mbar (279 to 278xc2xa0inhg){1]a large and powerful hurricane luis retained category 4 intensity until september 7 situated about 150xc2xa0mi (240xc2xa0km) to the north of puerto rico the storm gradually re-curved over the northern atlantic as a category 2 after having spent 7 consecutive days as a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) from september 1 to 8 from there on the center of the storm passed 200 miles (320xc2xa0km) to the west of bermuda on september 9 causing minor damage and then later weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane with winds of 110xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh){2] several hours later the hurricane made its closest approach to bermuda passing about 200xc2xa0mi (320xc2xa0km) west of the island{1] later that day the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of luis{3] during the afternoon of septemberxc2xa010 hurricane luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the canadian coastline{4] due to the rapid movement of the storm significant weakening did not occur until luis was at an unusually high latitude as the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961xc2xa0mbar (2838xc2xa0inhg) but sustained winds did not exceed 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) according to the nhc{1]{5]luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the avalon peninsula in eastern newfoundland early on septemberxc2xa011{1]{6] while tracking over newfoundland cold dry air became entrenched in luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough the nhc issued their final advisory on hurricane luis at 0900xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa011 as it tracked nearly 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 11 as it moved ashore on eastern newfoundland{1]{7] the extratropical remnants persisted for 30xc2xa0more hours over the north atlantic ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of greenland late on septemberxc2xa012{1]preparations{edit]hurricane luis on septemberxc2xa06 to the north of the leeward islands3 days before devastation occurred in the northern lesser antilles hurricane luis became a category 4 hurricane and forecasted to avoid those area well to the north following humberto and karen however as karen neared iris it weakened and absorbed by a stronger iris as influenced by the subtropical ridge steering luis to the westleeward islands and puerto rico{edit]due to its slow motion giving local officials ample time to prepare in advance of the storm tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared in several areas throughout the caribbean seventeen watches andor warnings were issued in association with luis the first two were a hurricane watch issued on antigua barbuda and guadeloupe on septemberxc2xa02 at 2200xc2xa0utc five hours later a tropical storm watch was issued for dominica at 2100xc2xa0utc a hurricane warning was issued for antigua barbuda and a hurricane watch for guadeloupe at 1500xc2xa0utc puerto rico was put under a tropical storm watch at 1700xc2xa0utc guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane warning four hours later puerto rico us and british virgin islands were put under a tropical storm warning this is including martinique and saint lucia{1]bermuda and canada{edit]additionally a tropical storm warning was also issued for bermuda on september 7 all of which were canceled by september 10 however there were no tropical storm watches or warnings issued for any part of atlantic canada{1]impact{edit]impact by country or

associated powerful winds and heavy rainfall the exact amount of damage caused by the storm is unknown due to lack of reports from affected areas since iris though it is estimated at 3xc2xa0billion (1995xc2xa0usd)antigua and barbuda{edit]as a result of a direct hit from the categoryxc2xa04 hurricane both antigua and barbuda experienced extensive damage to residences from 135xc2xa0mph winds and over 10 inches (250xc2xa0mm) of rain according to the islands' prime minister a great number of houses were damaged or destroyed in barbuda and nearly 45 of the residences on antigua were eradicated by the hurricane as it passed 25 miles (40xc2xa0km) to the north of the island{1] across the islands numerous inhabitants experienced power outages and disrupted water systems the storm ultimately accounted for three deaths and injured 165 locals; 32000 inhabitants on both islands were greatly affected forced 1700 people to take shelter and left approximately 3200 others homeless throughout the country the total damage from the storm was estimated 350xc2xa0million or 60 of the country's gdp worth of damage was assessed{12]international aid was sought after the storm had made its passing with

banana crops that been damaged at nearly 90 and sugar cane crops on the north at nearly 20 additionally 5 to 11 inches (130 to 280xc2xa0mm) of rain were recorded in the islands while the mountains regions recorded up to 20 inches (510xc2xa0mm) as the highest rainfall was 2291 inches (582xc2xa0mm) in la grande soufrixc3xa8re within the 48-hour period that damaged some roads specifically in the west coast where high waves washed houses and coastal road{19] the meteorological office in raizet recorded sustained winds of 48 miles per hour (77xc2xa0kmh) with gusts reached 66 miles per hour (106xc2xa0kmh) reported a fall in minimal pressure to 994 mb (2936 in hg) around 3 to 4 am on septemberxc2xa05 and a total 178 millimetres (70xc2xa0in) of rain during the whole period only the

250 millions of francs (50 millions usd) especially for the crops and the roadsst barthelemy{edit]the islands suffered extensive damages from 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) winds as the hurricane passed 155xc2xa0miles (25xc2xa0km) north of saint barthelemy the main weather station recorded wind speeds of 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) and gusts of up to 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh);{1] this difference may be due to local effects produced by mountainous terrain on the island and the aircraft sampling winds at a level above the region of maximum winds additionally minimal recorded pressure was at 948xc2xa0mbar (280xc2xa0inhg) as the storm made its closest approach and stay below 1000xc2xa0mbar (30xc2xa0inhg) for at least 36xc2xa0hours period{21]st martin{edit]wettest tropical cyclones and

also common in other towns such as marigot french quarter and philipsburg where at least 70 of the city was decimated by the storm it also caused the great salt pond to deluge several streets leaving them partially submerged by 1 feet of the 1500 boats sheltered in simpson bay lagoon nearly 1300 or 85 were sunken or run aground furthermore the hurricane affected 32000 on which 7000 were left people homeless (5000 haitians on their district in marigot) at least 60 of the residences of the island's 50000 people were damaged as nearly 15 of them were completely destroyed as some of them made uninhabitable this is including businesses churches hotels (4 of them been destroyed) and some schools some towns in the island spent nearly 3 months without water and power luis killed nine people (two in the french side and seven drowned in the dutch side)princess juliana airport recorded 87xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds with maximum gusts of 114xc2xa0mph (183xc2xa0kmh); the barometric pressure at its lowest fell between 963 to 964xc2xa0mbar (284 to 285xc2xa0inhg) the met office on the french side (grand case airport) of the island also measured a wind gust of 202xc2xa0mph (325xc2xa0kmh) while an unofficial anenometer in marigot's "marina" recorded wind gusts around 126xc2xa0mph (203xc2xa0kmh) tropical storm-force winds brushed the islands for approximately 21 hours while hurricane-force sustained winds lasted up to 8 hours as the hurricane passed with minimal forward speed between 7xc2xa0mph (11xc2xa0kmh) to 9xc2xa0mph (14xc2xa0kmh) total damages in both sides (french and dutch) was astronomic accounted for 18xc2xa0billion (1995xc2xa0usd) worth of damage{28] as such luis was the most devastating hurricane to hit the islands since hurricane donna

the worst hurricane the island suffered from 1960's hurricane donnast kitts and nevis{edit]luis passed nearly 50 miles (80xc2xa0km) northeast that caused very severe beach erosion{29] moderate damage to residences and leaving at least 2000 homeless on saint kitts and nevis the vegetation and some of the road infrastructure was badly damaged as a result of the storm with problems essentially arising in relation to the poor water system total damage ultimately reached to 197xc2xa0milliondominica{edit]as luis passed nearly at 120 miles (190xc2xa0km) north majority of the damage experienced in dominica was inflicted to banana crops that had already been damaged from iris at 70 while overall damages was fairly minor beach erosion was common and that disrupt and washed few beach hotels and coastal roads{29] where about 1000 people were left homeless due to rough waves on the northeastern and the western coast of the island's town such as marigot roseau and portsmouth 40 miles

storm affected the us east coast resulting in some beach erosion and damage to two waterfront structures on fire island{32] on septemberxc2xa07 rip currents produced by luis caused the death of one person near corncake inlet north carolina{33] high waves in combination with high tide caused significant beach erosion and coastal flooding in brunswick county eight homes were washed away by the

government of spain contributed 15873 in emergency funds to the affected regions{41]saint martin{edit]aside from high winds and seas possible explanation for the storm's heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations and their houses{1] another factual reason was substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at sea-level princess juliana airport on the dutch side and those measured on homes throughout the island hillsides  broadcast from sites off the island sea-level airport readings showed 86xc2xa0mph (139xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds and winds gusting to 114xc2xa0mph (183xc2xa0kmh){21] whereas measurements on some hillside homes and especially the airport on the north of the french side between two mountains showed wind gusts between 170 and 205xc2xa0mph (275 and 330xc2xa0kmh) an sailor that been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) winds gusting and a minimal pressure reading to 965xc2xa0mbar

isabel in 2003 ivan in 2004 and irma in 2017due to the severe damage and loss of life caused by the storm in the leeward islands the name "luis" was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never again
