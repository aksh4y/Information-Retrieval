2007 atlantic hurricane season it was the most intense north atlantic hurricane since hurricane wilma of 2005 tying for seventh overall additionally it made the third most intense atlantic hurricane landfall a cape verde-type hurricane that formed on august 13 2007 dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern atlantic ocean through the saint lucia channel and into the caribbean it strengthened into a major hurricane{nb 1] reaching categoryxc2xa05 status on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of jamaica on august 20 the storm made landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on augustxc2xa021 as a powerful categoryxc2xa05 storm it crossed the peninsula and emerged into the bay of campeche weakened but still a hurricane it strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near tecolutla in the mexican state of veracruz on august 22 dean drifted to the northwest weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern united states dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure only behind cyclone george in the australian region and tied with felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained windsthe hurricane's intense winds waves rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45xc2xa0deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of us166xc2xa0billion first impacting the islands of the lesser antilles dean's path through the caribbean devastated agricultural crops particularly those of martinique and jamaica upon reaching mexico hurricane dean was a categoryxc2xa05 storm but it missed major population centers and its exceptional categoryxc2xa05 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the caribbean islands it passed as a categoryxc2xa02 stormthrough the affected regions clean up and repair took months to complete donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads rebuilding houses and replanting destroyed crops in jamaica where the damage was worst banana production did not return to pre-storm levels for over a year mexico's tourist industry too took almost a year to rebuild its damaged cruise ship infrastructuredean was the first hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin at categoryxc2xa05 intensity since hurricane andrew on august 24 1992{2] dean's categoryxc2xa05 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than andrew's even though dean was much larger but its long swath of damage resulted in

saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon august 11 2007 a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa{3] and encountering favorable conditions{4] quickly developed into tropical depression four about 520xc2xa0miles (835xc2xa0km) west-southwest of cape verde on august 13{5] the depression moved briskly westward{6] and was upgraded to tropical storm dean at 1500xc2xa0utc on august 14{7] the storm's intensity continued to build{8] although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development ragged bands formed on august 15{9] and the formation of a partial eyewall was observed later that day{10]image of hurricane dean at category 5 hurricane strength on august 18 2007intensification continued{11] and the storm was upgraded to hurricane dean at 5xc2xa0am edt (0900 utc) august 16{12] the deep-layered ridge to the north continued to steer the system west towards the caribbean sea{13] the storm quickly strengthened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{14]{15] the storm's development slowed slightly but{16] a reconnaissance aircraft discovered a closed eyewall on august 17 as the storm passed through the lesser antilles{17] data from the aircraft indicated that hurricane dean had strengthened to a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane{18] and its trailing bands were still over the lesser antilles{19] during the evening of august 17 dean strengthened into a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{20] and continued to steadily grow in both size and intensity through the night{21] on august 18 the presence of a double eyewall was noted{22] indicating an eyewall replacement cycle and causing short term fluctuations in intensity{23] these fluctuations did not affect the storm's well defined satellite presentation{22] operationally dean was thought to have only been a categoryxc2xa04 on the 18th but post-storm analysis shows that dean had become a 165xc2xa0miles per hour (265xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa05 that day dean weakened very slightly on the morning of august 19 as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle and began to interact with the island of jamaica{24]hurricane dean passed south of jamaica on the evening of august 19{25] and began to intensify again that night{26] its eyewall replacement cycle was thought to be completed{27] a concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of august 20 but did not last long the hurricane still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high pressure system to the north moved over waters with extremely high heat content and began to strengthen once again{28] the eyewall became even better defined during the day{29] and at 8:35xc2xa0pm ast on august 20 (0035 august 21 utc) dean restrengthened to a category 5 hurricane the highest rating on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{30] it made landfall as a categoryxc2xa05 storm in quintana roo's costa maya region 40xc2xa0mi (65xc2xa0km) northeast of the border between mexico and belize and weakened on its way over land reemerging on the western side of yucatxc3xa1n as a categoryxc2xa01 storm{31] dean regained strength as it crossed the gulf of mexico and made its second landfall as a categoryxc2xa02 storm on august 22 at around 11:30 cdt near tecolutla veracruz to the south of tuxpan where after it moved westward losing strength and disintegrating over central mexico a small remnant circulation reached the pacific ocean{32] eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone roughly parallel to the mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern united states{33] where it completely dissipated on august 27{34]preparations{edit]hurricane dean's smooth and well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning to all of the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storm's impact{35] because of the advance warning and dean's extraordinary strength the nations of central america and the caribbean set up hundreds of shelters readied thousands of disaster recovery experts evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplieslesser antilles{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in the lesser antillesas hurricane dean approached the lesser antilles the local meteorological services issued watches and warnings advising residents to prepare for the storm hurricane warnings were issued for st lucia dominica{36] martinique and guadeloupe and its dependencies{37] hurricane watches were issued for saba and st eustatius{38] tropical storm warnings were issued for barbados{39] antigua barbuda st kitts nevis and st maarten{40] st vincent and the grenadines{40] the us virgin islands{41] and the british virgin islands{42] tropical storm watches were issued for sint maarten{38] st vincent grenada and its dependencies{39] montserrat and anguilla{43]local authorities closed airports set up shelters{44] and readied emergency service personnel{45] authorities in martinique canceled a memorial to the victims of west caribbean airways flight 708 and began to set up shelters{44] in dominica tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters and the vast majority of foreign medical students from the ross university school of medicine evacuated the island{44] the government of dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel{45] and evacuated princess margret hospital fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds{46] martinique's main airport and both of st lucia's commercial airports closed when the last airplanes landed on the night of august 16 and the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island{47]in anticipation of dean's significant damage several emergency response groups gathered funds and readied personnel on august 14 the caribbean disaster emergency response agency (cdera) placed its regional response mechanism on standby and contacted the national disaster coordinators of all member states in the lesser antilles{1] on august 15 the us agency for international development (usaid) dispatched teams to barbados dominica and st kitts in advance of the hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands{48] the eastern caribbean donor group convened a meeting on august 16 under the chair of the resident representative united nations development programme barbados in anticipation that member states would require international assistance{1]greater antilles{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in the greater antilleshurricane dean with its prominent eye clearly visible as photographed by astronauts on the international space stationhurricane warnings were issued for all of jamaica{49] for haiti from port-au-prince to the dominican border{50] and for the dominican republic from barahona to the haitian border{51] tropical storm warnings were issued for the rest of hispaniola{52] and for coastal cuba between camagxc3xbcey and guantxc3xa1namo{53] hundreds of thousands were evacuated from vulnerable low-lying and coastal areas{54] and disaster management programs were activated throughout the greater antilles{55]{56]{57]jamaica which was forecast to bear the brunt of hurricane dean underwent the most extensive preparations the jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons{58] political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the august 27 national elections to allow residents to prepare for the storm{59] curfews were put in place for parts of the island while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work more than 1000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes{60]{61] unicef prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1000 water containers and copa airlines agreed to fly the supplies to jamaica on its scheduled august 22 flight if possible the world food program prepared food stocks in nearby haiti ready to move them to jamaica if they were needed{56] the united nations disaster assessment and coordination (undac) team tried to reach jamaica but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled{56] the united states confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed{62] and the north-west caribbean donor group met to decide what actions would need to be taken{57]hms portland followed dean through the caribbean prepared to support damaged islands if necessarythe island of hispaniola was also predicted to be heavily affected by the storm workers from world vision supplied food clean water medicines and emergency generators in the southern provinces of the dominican republic and in the southern departments of haiti where hurricane warnings had been issued{55] in low-lying areas 1580xc2xa0residents of the dominican republic and more than 1000xc2xa0haitians were evacuated as the storm approached{54] small craft were advised to stay in port while haiti's toussaint louverture international airport was closed{58]the cayman islands were expected to suffer badly if hurricane dean passed too close and mandatory evacuations were instigated for the low-lying little cayman{63]{64] tourists were forbidden from entering the island{65] and extra flights were added to evacuate those that were already there{62]{65] schools and civic centers were converted to shelters on grand cayman and cayman brac and despite the mandatory evacuation one shelter was opened on little cayman for the residents who remained there{66] expecting catastrophic damage two royal navy ships of the atlantic patrol task (north) hms portland and rfa wave ruler followed 150xc2xa0mi (240xc2xa0km) behind the storm in order to arrive at cayman as soon after the hurricane as possible{67]cuba and puerto rico neither of which were expected to experience the worst of dean's strength prepared more modestly cuba's civil defense evacuated 350000xc2xa0people from the coastal provinces{54]{68] the government in havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm{62] soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters but stood down when it became evident that they would not needed{58] the us federal emergency management agency (fema) deployed a five-member team to puerto rico ahead of hurricane dean they were equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage{69]mexico{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in mexicohurricane dean over the yucatxc3xa1n on august 21with hurricane dean's path predicted well in advance of the storm{70] the government of mexico was able to make ample preparations on august 17 a state of emergency was declared for the state of quintana roo where dean was expected to make landfall on august 18 authorities began evacuating tourists{71] and those residents living in the most vulnerable parts of quintana roo{59]{72] the state government set up storm shelters in schools and other public buildings{73] with emergency supplies at the ready the state of yucatxc3xa1n quintana roo's neighbour to the northwest declared a green alert{74] on august 19 a hurricane watch was issued on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula from chetumal to san felipe and residents made their last-minute preparations{75]belize{edit]a hurricane warning was issued for the coastal locations north of belize city with the forecast of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) winds{76] the government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from belize city to the mexican border{77] on august 16xc2xa0andxc2xa017 prime minister said musa chaired two meetings of belize's national emergency management organization (nemo){73] he instructed the newly created coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites caye caulker and ambergris caye by boat and plane{77]{78] authorities also evacuated belize city's three hospitals moving high-risk patients inland to the capital belmopan the mayor urged residents to leave belize city and to make use of shelters in the capital{77]the united nations disaster assessment and coordination team dispatched two members to belize city and the rest of the team traveled to belmopan{68] government supplies were stored in orange walk corozal ready for post-storm relief{68]{73] essential equipment from the red cross and the pan american health organization was stored in the elevated unicef building and the belize city un building was converted to a crisis center{68]gulf of mexico{edit]hundreds of oil platforms such as this one in the gulf of mexico were evacuated in anticipation of hurricane deanoil futures spiked on august 15 as analysts considered the impact of hurricane dean on refining capacity if it were to move into the caribbean as predicted{79]{80] transocean evacuated 11 nonessential workers late on augustxc2xa015 from an oil rig located about 160xc2xa0mi (260xc2xa0km) southeast of new orleans the company left about 125xc2xa0personnel on board the structure{81] a day later royal dutch shell evacuated 275 ancillary staff following an evacuation of 188 due to tropical storm erin{82]on august 18 2007 10300 barrels (1640xc2xa0m3) of oil and 11xc2xa0millionxc2xa0cubic feet (310000xc2xa0mxc2xb3) of natural gas were shut-in per day accounting for 08 of crude production in the gulf of mexico by 11:30xc2xa0am cst (1630 utc) two rigs and one platform evacuated personnel{83]pemex the state-owned mexican oil company made preparations to shut down oil production on august 19 ahead of dean{62] it evacuated 13360xc2xa0workers from more than 140xc2xa0oil platforms using 55xc2xa0boats and 29xc2xa0helicopters{54] as the storm continued to intensify the number of evacuated pemex workers increased to 18000 on august 20 and all 407xc2xa0wells and drilling operations were abandoned this reduced the worldwide production of oil and natural gas by 265 million barrels (421000xc2xa0m3) and 26xc2xa0billion cubic feet (74000000xc2xa0m3) per day respectively{84]other regions{edit]throughout the caribbean sea about a dozen cruise ships altered their routes to avoid hurricane dean{82] honduras was put on a state of preventative alert for 48xc2xa0hours particularly the departments to the north of the country; the bay islands were on a state of red alert there were places ready to accommodate 10000xc2xa0people for 15xc2xa0days if necessary{85]in the united states the louisiana governor's office of homeland security and emergency preparedness activated its crisis action team on august 16 to monitor the storm and coordinate preparation{69] governor of louisiana kathleen blanco declared a state of emergency early on the evening of august 17{86] asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall{69] texas governor rick perry declared dean to be an imminent threat to the state and thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on august 17 when the storm was at least five days away{87] prior to the storm texas suffered severe flooding from several junexe2x80x93july storms and tropical storm erin left the ground still saturated governor perry feared that more rainfall from dean would cause additional flash flooding{88] and had 250 texas parks and wildlife department crews on standby with boats to assist in potential evacuations he was willing to deploy up to 10000 texas military forces soldiers and did deploy several elements of the texas state guard who set up emergency shelters{69] the texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing a disruption to the fuel distribution system{69] in anticipation of evacuations the texas department of transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow{69] nasa cut short the sts-118 mission as a precaution in case dean approached mission control at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston{89] to that effect mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours{90] allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned{58]{91]impact{edit]deaths and damage by

hurricane dean in the lesser antilleshurricane dean entered the caribbean as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane through the saint lucia channel on august 17{17] it moved briskly between the lesser antillean islands of st lucia and martinique{17] with its storm surge and rain bands reaching every island in the chain{35] damage was most severe in martinique where total damage was estimated at xe2x82xac400xc2xa0million and three indirect deaths while nearby guadaloupe suffered xe2x82xac400xc2xa0million of damage in st lucia damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at us18xc2xa0million{35]martinique experienced 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) winds with gusts to 105xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh){17] the torrential rainfall which reached 332xc2xa0mm (1307xc2xa0in){35] caused flooding throughout the island with the town of rivixc3xa8re-pilote flooding completely the majority of martinique's population were left without electricity water telephone or food and 600 martiniquans were left homeless{97]{98]{99] the storm destroyed martinique's entire banana crop and 70 of the island's sugar cane plantations{100] the damage to these two agricultural sectors accounted for the majority of the island's xe2x82xac400xc2xa0million damageon the evening of august 16 12xc2xa0hours before the storm arrived in st lucia power outages began in some of the island's neighborhoods the night saw heavy rains 158xc2xa0in (40xc2xa0mm) at st lucia's hewanorra international airport{101]{102] and intense thunderstorms and by morning hurricane force winds peaked at 90xc2xa0mph (145xc2xa0kmh){103] the winds uprooted trees{45] downed electricity poles disabled bridges triggered landslides and damaged several roofs saint lucia's capital castries was flooded by the storm surge which left boulders and fishing boats on the streets one person drowned in sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow{82]{104] hurricane dean damaged the roofs of two of the island's hospitals but no one was injured{46]{105] several other buildings were damaged mostly on the island's northern coast which was most exposed to the hurricane{106] the ministry of education reported that 11 schools had sustained a combined total of ec300000 of damage{107] and nationwide damage to housing and buildings totaled ec800000{107] the ministry of communications works transport and public utilities reported that most of the country's major infrastructure remained functional and no long-term disruptions occurred{106]{107]the hardest hit area of saint lucia was its agricultural sector 5000 acres (20xc2xa0km2) of banana farms in mabouya valley roseau valley and marc marc were severely damaged with many of the plantations waterlogged or outright destroyed{103]{108] an average of 75 of the crops were lost with fields in the northern farms losing up to 80 and in the roseau valley losing up to 85 the cost to the agriculture industry was 132xc2xa0million bringing hurricane dean's total cost on the island to 173xc2xa0million (us64xc2xa0million in 2007) or 05 of the nation's gdp{107]{109]{110]greater

its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands and delivered hurricane force winds to jamaica puerto rico cuba and the cayman islands were mostly spared{111] though hurricane dean passed 50 to 60xc2xa0mi (80 to 95xc2xa0km) south of jamaica as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{35]{112] in jamaica the rain caused flooding on the eastern side of the island and landslides on the northeast end{113] at least two direct deaths were confirmed{114] over 1500 roofs were lost primarily to the hurricane force winds{115] and 1582 of the 3127 damaged homes were uninhabitable{116] landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads particularly in the rural northeast region{117]{118] as in the lesser antilles jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector forty percent of the sugarcane crop 80 to 100 of the banana crop 75 of the coffee trees under three years old and 20 of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost{116] hurricane dean affected 248 roads including 186 that were blocked:{117]{118] 10 were blocked in the kingston metropolitan region{117] 14 sections were blocked in st andrew 43 roads were blocked in st catherine eight roads were blocked in the western region (saint james hanover westmoreland and trelawny) and 110 roads were blocked in the northeast region{118]damage in bull bayhaiti and the dominican republic which share the island of hispaniola were spared much of the hurricane's force as it passed 170xc2xa0mi (270xc2xa0km) to their south{119]{120] however 15xc2xa0people were killed among the island's two nations{54]{73]{121] heavy rain flooded the streets of santo domingo{122] and rough surf pounded the coast{54]{123] rain also caused landslides in haiti{124] destroying several hundred homes and forcing 5154xc2xa0people into temporary shelters{73] and compromising the temperamental water system in the town of bainet{121]cuba puerto rico and the cayman islands experienced high surf and heavy rains though despite a power outage in grand cayman{125] no significant damage was reported{111] there 2000xc2xa0people weathered the storm in temporary shelters the hurricane's outer bands swept over cuba between august 19 and august 21 bringing heavy rain and high seas yet sparing the island from damaging winds{125] rain from hurricane dean flooded several roads throughout puerto rico and there was heavy surf along the island's

significant flooding{126] the town of majahual which had a population of 200 was totally destroyed by the storm storm surge and high winds severely damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings{127] and had the strength to crumple steel girders{35] the waves tore away portions of the concrete docks at costa maya's popular cruise port and the harbor was closed to cruise ships for almost a year{127]{128] despite the storm's tremendous intensity not a single death was attributed to its initial landfall owing mostly to the government's thorough preparations and forecasters' ample

the roof collapsed in their house{132]{135] hurricane dean killed 12xc2xa0people in mexico but remarkably no one was killed by its first (and catastrophically powerful) landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{35] between the two landfalls damages focused mainly in the agricultural sector totaled mex205xc2xa0billion (us160xc2xa0million){136]belize{edit]the town of corozal on belize's northern border experienced the worst conditions in the country trees were downed throughout the town{77] and minor flooding was reported{137] eight thousand were displaced to shelters though all returned home in less than two days{138] throughout the entire country the belizean ministry of health reported no storm-related fatalities and only a few minor injuries{138]belize's agricultural sector received significant damage its sugar cane fields and papaya crops suffered extensive damage{137]{139] the belizian government's national emergency management organization estimated dean's damage to the papaya industry at bz30xc2xa0million and to the sugar industry at 6000 acres (24xc2xa0km2) worth bz36xc2xa0million{140] belize sugar industries ltd reported that the country's sugar crop that year was the worst on record producing 980000xc2xa0lb (445000xc2xa0kg) of sub-standard cane compared to 12xc2xa0millionxc2xa0lb (545000xc2xa0kg) of high quality cane the year before{141] more than 1000xc2xa0people were out of work as a result of the damage to the papaya and sugar cane plantations{138] the government attempted to improve the next crop season in 2008 by providing fertilizers to the farmers whose land had been damaged by dean the year before{142] prime minister said musa estimated that it would cost us10xc2xa0million to replace or repair all the damaged houses in belize{140]other regions{edit]no land effects were reported in nicaragua but a four-year-old girl drowned on a boat that sank amidst high winds and waves at the mouth of the kukra river{95]while the hurricane itself never approached the united states heavy surf and rip currents were reported on the beaches of florida one person drowned and at least 35xc2xa0people had to be rescued from the turbulent waters at siesta key caused by hurricane dean{143] rough seas produced by dean caused minor flooding in dauphin island alabama damages from the flooding amounted to 100000{144] the remnant circulation of dean after lingering off the pacific coast moved inland by santa barbara california and brought heavy thunderstorms and localized flooding to coastal southern california on the morning of august 26{145] the remnants crossed the mojave desert on the morning of august 27 las vegas received a daily record of 058xc2xa0in (15xc2xa0mm) of rain with flash flooding and minor damage{146]aftermath{edit]this royal caribbean ship freedom of the seas was the first cruise ship to visit jamaica after hurricane dean it called into ocho rios on august 22despite dean's significant damage it did not have severe effects on infrastructure and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the western caribbean in anticipation of hurricane dean's passage though by august 27 all were back on schedule except those with damaged ports in belize and the yucatxc3xa1n the lesser antilles and the greater antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines as their ports opened within days{128]lesser antilles{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in the lesser antillesalthough hurricane dean was only a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane when its northern eyewall passed over martinique the wind and widespread flooding destroyed 70 of the island's sugar cane crop and all of its banana crop valued at xe2x82xac400xc2xa0million {35] or 10 of gdp{147] remarkably the tourism industry withstood the storm well; only a few hotels reported minor damage and the airport opened the day after the hurricane{128]{148]{149] other than landscaping damage all of the island's hotels were fully functional by the end of august{128]the french overseas minister christian estrozy and french prime minister francois fillon visited french caribbean island to assess the storm's damage they estimated the storm left 600xc2xa0people homeless the brevity of their visit prompted some of martinique's famous writers including edouard glissant patrick chamoiseau and raphael confiant to write an open letter airing their grievances concerning french politics and the handling of hurricane dean's impact{150]francois fillon then visited guadaloupe and brought with him a team of experts from the ministry of the interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage{151] the local government reported to them that 75 of guadeloupe's banana plantations valued at xe2x82xac100xc2xa0million were totally destroyed{35] despite promises by overseas minister christian estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months{152] it took over six months to restart banana production and several more to restore lost capacity{153] other than the crop damage the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage both of which were quickly repaired{154]jamaica{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in the greater antillesheavy machinery clearing sand off the road to norman manley international airport kingston jamaica after it was buried by hurricane deanon august 24 jamaican prime minister portia simpson miller announced that her government would provide ja225xc2xa0million (us32xc2xa0million) in emergency assistance to the country's agriculture sector this aid was targeted at the country's hardest-hit parishes{155] she also announced a ja500xc2xa0million (us71xc2xa0million) programme to provide grants and low-interest loans for emergency housing repairs temporary tarpaulins were also provided to patch roofs at no cost{156]the world food program immediately placed 5500xc2xa0jamaicans on complementary food assistance a daily ration of 1900xc2xa0kj (450xc2xa0kcal) of high energy biscuits for two weeks{157] within three days us398000 of pre-prepared united states agency for international development (usaid) emergency supplies arrived on the island the airlift was composed mostly of mattresses blankets plastic sheeting hygiene kits and water containers{115] the inter-american development bank (idb) provided a us200000 grant to support the relief effort{158] and the chinese red cross despite dealing with typhoon sepat sent us30000 to its jamaican counterpart for the purchase of emergency relief supplies{159]in december four months after the hurricane struck the island the world bank's board of directors approved a us10xc2xa0million emergency loan{160] world bank director for the caribbean and the jamaican finance minister negotiated a 17-year repayment plan and endowed the money into the jamaica hurricane dean emergency recovery project the jamaica social investment fund which was charged with implementing the project used the money to "rebuild and support schools health centers and community and farm roads affected by the hurricane"{161]{162] the hurricane dean emergency recovery project finally kicked off in june 2008 with the issuance of rural road repair contracts valued at ja37xc2xa0million (us520000){163]by the end of the summer on 2008 banana production in jamaica was returning to pre-dean levels with the help of ja11xc2xa0billion (us155xc2xa0million) of aid from the eu's banana support programme thousands of acres were replanted banana chips were the first products ready for export at the beginning of the summer with fresh banana production following shortly thereafter{164]mexico{edit]main article: effects of hurricane dean in mexicocosta maya mexico the pier and resort seen here were destroyed by hurricane dean but rebuilt the following yearalthough dean's landfall in mexico occurred in a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning the storm inflicted extreme damage in majahual the only town to experience the full force of the hurricane hundreds of buildings were destroyed{35] quintana roo governor fxc3xa9lix gonzxc3xa1lez canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of chetumal was completed within three weeks it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads{128] unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid together they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37000xc2xa0residences{165]the cruise port of puerto costa maya was severely damaged causing carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean cruises the world's two largest cruise operators to divert away from the port until at least 2009{166] the mexican government was quick to fund rebuilding of the destroyed concrete piers{167] which by june 2008 were rebuilt to accommodate even larger ships than before{168]the federal government was initially lauded for its swift and thorough preparation to which most observers including the united nations attributed dean's low death toll{129]{130] however after the storm there were several accusations of political motivation in the distribution of aid members of president felipe calderxc3xb3n's partido accion nacional (pan) distributed bags of bread funded by the nation's disaster relief coffers carrying the party's logo in veracruz governor fidel herrera was accused by both the pan and his own partido revolucionario institucional (pri) of using state resources including hurricane relief to support the campaigns of pri candidates{169]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesas the first categoryxc2xa05 landfalling hurricane in 15xc2xa0years and due to its widespread impact the name dean was
