largest city by area in the contiguous united states{9] it is the county seat of duval county{10] with which the city government consolidated in 1968 consolidation gave jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits; with an estimated population of 913010 as of 2017 jacksonville is the most populous city in the state of florida{11] and the southeastern united states{12] the jacksonville metropolitan area has a population of 1626611 it is the 34th largest msa in the united states and fourth largest in florida{13]jacksonville is centered on the banks of the st johns river in the first coast region of northeast florida about 25 miles (40xc2xa0km) south of the georgia state line and 340 miles (550xc2xa0km) north of miami the jacksonville beaches communities are along the adjacent atlantic coast the area was originally inhabited by the timucua people and in 1564 was the site of the french colony of fort caroline one of the earliest european settlements in what is now the continental united states under british rule settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed known as wacca pilatka to the seminole and the cow ford to the british a platted town was established there in 1822 a year after the united states gained florida from spain; it was named after andrew jackson the first military

jacksonville's military bases and the nearby naval submarine base kings bay form the third largest military presence in the united states{15] significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking insurance healthcare and logistics as with much of florida tourism is also important to the jacksonville area particularly tourism related to golf{16]{17] people from jacksonville may

(center) from bernard romans' 1776 map of floridathe area of the modern city of jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years on black hammock island in the national timucuan ecological and historic preserve a university of north florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the united states dating to 2500 bc{18] in the 16th century the beginning of the historical era the region was inhabited by the mocama a coastal subgroup of the timucua people at the time of contact with europeans all mocama villages in present-day jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the saturiwa centered around the mouth of the st johns river{19] one early map shows a village called ossachite at the site of what is now downtown jacksonville; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area{20]replica of jean ribault's column claiming florida for france in 1562french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river in 1562 calling it the river of may because that was the month of his discovery ribault erected a stone column at the site claiming the newly discovered land for france{21] in 1564 renxc3xa9 goulaine de laudonnixc3xa8re established the first european settlement fort caroline on the st johns near the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro menxc3xa9ndez de avilxc3xa9s to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline on september 20 1565 a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st augustine attacked fort caroline and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it{22] the spanish renamed the fort san mateo and following the ejection of the french st augustine's position as the most important settlement in florida was solidified the location of fort caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the st johns river in 1964{23]spain ceded florida to the british in 1763 after the french and indian war and the british soon constructed the king's road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there{24]{25]{26] the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish{27] britain ceded control of the territory to spain in 1783 after being defeated in the american revolutionary war and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821 american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town laying out the streets and plats they soon named the town jacksonville after andrew jackson led by isaiah d hart residents wrote a charter for a town government which was approved by the florida legislative council on february 9 1832civil war and the gilded age{edit]union army guard house on bay street in december 1864during the american civil war jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from florida to feed the confederate forces the city was blockaded by union forces who gained control of nearby fort clinch though no battles were fought in jacksonville proper the city changed hands several times between union and confederate forces in the skirmish of the brick church in 1862 confederates won their first victory in the state{28] however union forces captured a confederate position at the battle of st johns bluff and occupied jacksonville in 1862 slaves escaped to freedom in union lines in february 1864 union forces left jacksonville and confronted a confederate army at the battle of olustee going down to defeatunion forces retreated to jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war in march 1864 a confederate cavalry confronted a union expedition in the battle of cedar creek warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war{29]during reconstruction and the gilded age jacksonville and nearby st augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad president grover cleveland attended the sub-tropical exposition in the city on february 22 1888 during his trip to florida{30] this highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism the city's tourism however was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks in addition extension of the florida east coast railway further south drew visitors to other areas from 1893 to 1938 jacksonville was the site of the florida old confederate soldiers and sailors home; it operated a nearby cemetery{31]great fire of 1901{edit]ruins of the courthouse and armory from the great fire of 1901on may 3 1901 downtown jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly in just eight hours it swept through 146 city blocks destroyed over 2000 buildings left about 10000 homeless and killed seven residents the confederate monument in hemming park was one of the few landmarks to survive the fire governor william sherman jennings declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order; on may 17 municipal authority resumed{32] it is said the glow from the flames could be seen in savannah georgia and the smoke plumes seen in raleigh north carolina known as the "great fire of 1901" it was one of the worst disasters in florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern united states architect henry john klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city the first multi-story structure built by klutho was the dyal-upchurch building in 1902{33]{34] the st james building built on the previous site of the st james hotel that burned down was built in 1912 as klutho's crowning achievement{35]modern jacksonville{edit]downtown jacksonville in 1914in the 1910s new yorkxe2x80x93based filmmakers were attracted to jacksonville's warm climate exotic locations excellent rail access and cheap labor over the course of the decade more than 30 silent film studios were established earning jacksonville the title of "winter film capital of the world" however the emergence of hollywood as a major film production center ended the city's film industry one converted movie studio site norman studios remains in arlington; it has been converted to the jacksonville silent film museum at norman studios{36]during this time jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center with companies such as barnett bank atlantic national bank florida national bank prudential gulf life afro-american insurance independent life and american heritage life thriving in the business district the us navy became a major employer and economic force during the 1940s and the second world war constructing two navy bases in the city and the us marine corps establishing blount island commandjacksonville like most large cities in the united states suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after world war ii the construction of federal highways was a kind of subsidy that enabled development of suburban housing and wealthier better established residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs after world war ii the government of the city of jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom mayor w haydon burns' jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall civic auditorium public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride however the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class "white flight" resulted in a remaining population with a higher level of poverty overall{37]given the postwar migration of residents businesses and jobs the city's tax base declined it had difficulty funding education sanitation and traffic control within the city limits in addition residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958 a study recommended that the city of jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed larger geographic tax base to improve services throughout the county voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965 the city's largest ethnic group non-hispanic white{37] declined from 758 of the population in 1970 to 551 by 2010{38]news of jacksonville's consolidation from the florida times-unionon december 29 1963 the hotel roosevelt fire killed 22 people the highest one-day death toll in jacksonville{39] on september 10 1964 hurricane dora made landfall near st augustine causing major damage to buildings in north florida hurricane dora was the first hurricane to make a direct hit to north florida{40]in the mid 1960s corruption scandals arose among city officials who were mainly part of a traditional conservative democratic white old boy network that had dominated politics for decades after a grand jury was convened to investigate 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resignjacksonville consolidation led by j j daniel and claude yates began to win more support during this period from both inner-city blacks who wanted more involvement in government after passage of civil rights legislation restored their ability to vote and whites in the suburbs who wanted more services and more control over the central city in 1964 all 15 of duval county's public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform lower taxes increased economic development unification of the community better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated governmentwhen a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 voters approved the plan on october 1 1968 the city and county governments merged to create the consolidated city of jacksonville fire police health  welfare recreation public works and housing  urban development were all combined under the new government in honor of the occasion then-mayor hans tanzler posed with actress lee meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the "bold new city of the south" at florida 13 and julington creek{41] the consolidation created a 900 square mile entitythe better jacksonville plan promoted as a blueprint for jacksonville's future and approved by jacksonville voters in 2000 authorized a half-penny sales tax this would generate most of the revenue required for the 225 billion package of major projects that included road  infrastructure improvements environmental preservation targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities{42]the nfl awarded jacksonville an nfl franchise called the jacksonville jaguars on november 30 1993{43] in 2005 jacksonville hosted super bowl xxxix that was seen by an estimated 86 million viewers{44]in october 2016 hurricane matthew

jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous united states; of this 8666 (7577xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi or 1962xc2xa0km2) is land and 1334 (1167xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi or 302xc2xa0km2) is water jacksonville surrounds the town of baldwin nassau county lies to the north baker county lies to the west and clay and st johns county lie to the south; the atlantic ocean lies to the east along with the jacksonville beaches the st johns river divides the city the trout river a major tributary of the st johns river is located entirely within jacksonvillethe state of florida including jacksonville is a huge flat plateau with a high water table and surface lakes are very shallow{48] the united states geological survey states that the highest point in jacksonville is only 40 feet (122 meters) above sea level making the area susceptible to flooding and storm surge{49] soil composition is primarily sand and clay rather than limestone so very few sinkholes develop; however deep large diameter sinkholes do occur{50]cityscape{edit]architecture{edit]see also: architecture of jacksonville and list of tallest buildings in jacksonvillethe architecture of jacksonville varies in style few structures in the city center predate the great fire of 1901{51] the city is home to one of the largest collections of prairie school style buildings outside the midwest{52] following the great fire of 1901 henry john klutho would come to influence generations of local designers with his works by both the chicago school championed by louis sullivan and the prairie school of architecture popularized by frank lloyd wright jacksonville is also home to a notable collection of mid-century modern architecture{53] local architects robert c broward taylor hardwick and william morgan adapted a range design principles including international style brutalism futurism and organicism all applied with an american interpretation generally referred to today as mid-century modern design{53] the architecture firms of reynolds smith  hills (rsh){54] and kemp bunch  jackson (kbj) have also contributed a number of important works to the city's modern architectural movementjacksonville's early predominant position as a regional center of business left an indelible mark on the city's skyline many of the earliest skyscrapers in the state were constructed in jacksonville dating to 1902{55] the city last held the state height record from 1974 to 1981{56] the tallest building in downtown jacksonville's skyline is the bank of america tower constructed in 1990 as the barnett center it has a height of 617xc2xa0ft (188xc2xa0m) and includes 42 floors{57]{58] other notable structures include the 37-story wells fargo center (with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the jacksonville skyline){59]{60] originally built in 1972-74 by the independent life and accident insurance company and the 28-floor riverplace tower  when completed in 1967 it was the tallest

weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from may through september while the driest months are from november through april rainfall averages around 52 inches (1300xc2xa0mm) a year{63] due to jacksonville's low latitude and coastal location the city has infrequent cold weather and winters are typically mild and sunny summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are commonmean monthly temperatures range from around 53xc2xa0xc2xb0f (12xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in january to 82xc2xa0xc2xb0f (28xc2xa0xc2xb0c) in july high temperatures average 64 to 92xc2xa0xc2xb0f (18 to 33xc2xa0xc2xb0c) throughout the year{64] high heat indices are common for the summer months in the area with indices above 110xc2xa0xc2xb0f (433xc2xa0xc2xb0c) possible the highest temperature recorded was 104xc2xa0xc2xb0f (40xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on july 11 1879 and july 28 1872{65] it is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon these are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water combined with extremely high humidityduring winter there can be hard freezes during the night such cold weather is usually short lived as the city averages only 10 to 15 nights at or below freezing and around 5 days where the high does not rise above 50xc2xa0xc2xb0f (10xc2xa0xc2xb0c){66] the coldest temperature recorded at jacksonville international airport was 7xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x9214xc2xa0xc2xb0c) on january 21 1985 jacksonville has recorded three days with measurable snow since 1911 most recently a one-inch (25xc2xa0cm) snowfall in december 1989{67] and flurries in december 2010{68]jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane the city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the gulf of mexico to the atlantic ocean or passing to the north or south in the atlantic and brushing past the area{69] the strongest effect on jacksonville was from hurricane dora in 1964 the only recorded storm to hit the first coast with sustained hurricane-force winds the eye crossed st augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) making it a strong category 2 on the saffir-simpson scale jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's tropical storm fay which crisscrossed the state bringing parts of jacksonville under darkness for four days similarly four years prior to this jacksonville was inundated by hurricane frances and hurricane jeanne which made landfall south of the area these tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to jacksonville hurricane floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to jacksonville beach during floyd the jacksonville beach pier was severely damaged and later demolished the rebuilt pier was later damaged by fay but not destroyed tropical storm bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004 spawning a minor tornado in the process{70] on may 28 2012 jacksonville was hit by tropical storm beryl packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113xc2xa0kmh) which made landfall near jacksonville beachclimate data for jacksonville florida (jacksonville int'l)
