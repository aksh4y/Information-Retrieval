see inclination (disambiguation)fig 1: one view of inclination i (green) and other orbital parametersorbital inclination measures the tilt of an object's orbit around a celestial body it is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting objectfor a satellite orbiting the earth directly above the equator the plane of the satellite's orbit is the same as the earth's equatorial plane and the satellite's orbital inclination is 0xc2xb0 the general case is that the satellite's orbit is tilted; it spends half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern if the orbit swung between 20xc2xb0 north latitude and 20xc2xb0 south latitude then its orbital inclination would be 20xc2xb0contents1 orbits11 natural and artificial satellites12 exoplanets and multiple star systems2 other meaning3 calculation4 see also5 referencesorbits{edit]the inclination is one of the six orbital elements describing the shape and orientation of a celestial orbit it is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference normally stated in degrees for a satellite orbiting a planet the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planet's equator for planets in the solar system the plane of reference is usually the ecliptic the plane in which the earth orbits the sun{1]{2] this reference plane is most practical for earth-based observers therefore earth's inclination is by definition zeroinclination could instead be measured with respect to another plane such as the sun's equator or the invariable plane (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the solar system approximately the orbital plane of jupiter)most planetary orbits in the solar system have relatively small inclinations both in relation to each other and to the sun's equator:inclinationnameinclinationto eclipticinclinationto sun's equatorinclinationto invariable

inclinations to the ecliptic of 17xc2xb0 and 44xc2xb0 respectively and the large asteroid pallas is inclined at 34xc2xb0natural and artificial satellites{edit]the inclination of orbits of natural or artificial satellites is measured relative to the equatorial plane of the body they orbit if they orbit sufficiently closely the equatorial plane is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the central bodyan inclination of 30xc2xb0 could also be described using an angle of 150xc2xb0 the convention is that the normal orbit is prograde an orbit in the same direction as the planet rotates inclinations greater than 90xc2xb0 describe retrograde orbits thus:an inclination of 0xc2xb0 means the orbiting body has a prograde orbit in the planet's equatorial planean inclination greater than 0xc2xb0 and less than 90xc2xb0 also describe prograde orbitsan inclination of 634xc2xb0 is often called a critical inclination when describing artificial satellites orbiting the earth because they have zero apogee drift{4]an inclination of exactly 90xc2xb0 is a polar orbit in which the spacecraft passes over the north and south poles of the planetan inclination greater than 90xc2xb0 and less than 180xc2xb0 is a retrograde orbitan inclination of exactly 180xc2xb0 is a retrograde equatorial orbitfor impact-generated moons of terrestrial planets not too far from their star with a large planetxe2x80x93moon distance the orbital planes of moons tend to be aligned with the planet's orbit around the star due to tides from the star but if the planetxe2x80x93moon distance is small it may be inclined for gas giants the orbits of moons tend to be aligned with the giant planet's equator because these formed in circumplanetary disks{5]exoplanets and multiple star systems{edit]the inclination of exoplanets or members of multiple stars is the angle of the plane of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight from earth to the objectan inclination of 0xc2xb0 is a face-on orbit meaning the plane of its orbit is parallel to the skyan inclination of 90xc2xb0 is an edge-on orbit meaning the plane of its orbit is perpendicular to the skysince the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin-orbit angle or spin-orbit alignment in most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknownbecause the radial-velocity method more easily finds planets with orbits closer to edge-on most exoplanets found by this method have inclinations between 45xc2xb0 and 135xc2xb0 although in most cases the inclination is not known consequently most exoplanets found by radial velocity have true masses no more than 40 greater than their minimum masses{citation needed] if the orbit is almost face-on especially for superjovians detected by radial velocity then those objects may actually be brown dwarfs or even red dwarfs one particular example is hd 33636 b which has true mass 142 mj corresponding to an m6v star while its minimum mass was 928 mjif the orbit is almost edge-on then the planet can be seen transiting its starother meaning{edit]for planets and other rotating celestial bodies the angle of the equatorial plane relative to the orbital plane xe2x80x94 such as the tilt of the earth's poles toward or away from the sun xe2x80x94 is sometimes also called inclination but less ambiguous terms are axial tilt or obliquitycalculation{edit]components of the calculation of the
