england english new england frenchnew england is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeastern united states: maine vermont new hampshire massachusetts rhode island and connecticut{a] it is bordered by the state of new york to the west and by the canadian provinces of new brunswick and quebec to the northeast and north respectively the atlantic ocean is to the east and southeast and long island sound is to the south boston is new england's largest city as well as the capital of massachusetts the largest metropolitan area is greater boston which also includes worcester massachusetts (the second-largest city in new england) manchester (the largest city in new hampshire) and providence (the capital and largest city of rhode island) with nearly a third of the entire region's populationin 1620 puritan separatist pilgrims from england first settled in the region forming the plymouth colony the second successful english settlement in america following the jamestown settlement in virginia founded in 1607 ten years later more puritans settled north of plymouth colony in boston thus forming massachusetts bay colony over the next 126 years people in the region fought in four french and indian wars until the british and their iroquois allies defeated the french and their algonquin allies in north america in 1692 the town of salem massachusetts and surrounding areas experienced the salem witch trials one of the most infamous cases of mass hysteria in the history of the western hemisphere{10]in the late 18th century political leaders from the new england colonies known as the sons of liberty initiated resistance to britain's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists the boston tea party was a protest to which britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping massachusetts of self-government which were termed the "intolerable acts" by the colonists the confrontation led to the first battles of the american revolutionary war in 1775 and the expulsion of the british authorities from the region in spring 1776 the region also played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the united states and was the first region of the us transformed by the industrial revolution centered on the blackstone and merrimack river valleysthe physical geography of new england is diverse for such a small area southeastern new england is covered by a narrow coastal plain while the western and northern regions are dominated by the rolling hills and worn-down peaks of the northern end of the appalachian mountains the atlantic fall line lies close to the coast which enabled numerous cities to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers such as the connecticut river which bisects the region from north to southeach state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as towns many of which are governed by town meetings the only unincorporated areas in the region exist in the sparsely populated northern regions of maine new hampshire and vermont the region is one of the us census bureau's nine regional divisions and the only multi-state region with clear consistent boundaries it maintains a strong sense of cultural identity{11] although the terms of this identity are often contrasted combining puritanism with liberalism agrarian life with industry and

algonquian peoplesthe earliest known inhabitants of new england were american indians who spoke a variety of the eastern algonquian languages{12] prominent tribes included the abenakis mi'kmaq penobscot pequots mohegans narragansetts pocumtucks and wampanoag{12] prior to the arrival of european settlers the western abenakis inhabited new hampshire new york and vermont as well as parts of quebec and western maine{13] their principal town was norridgewock in present-day maine{14]the penobscot lived along the penobscot river in maine the narragansetts and smaller tribes under narragansett sovereignty lived in most of modern-day rhode island west of narragansett bay including block island the wampanoag occupied southeastern massachusetts rhode island and the islands of martha's vineyard and nantucket the pocumtucks lived in western massachusetts and the mohegan and pequot tribes lived in the connecticut region the connecticut river valley includes parts of vermont new hampshire massachusetts and connecticut linking numerous tribes culturally linguistically and politically{12]as early as 1600 french dutch and english traders began exploring the new world trading metal glass and cloth for local beaver pelts{12]{15]colonial period{edit]the virginia companies{edit]main article: new england colonieson april 10 1606 king james i of england issued a charter for the virginia company which comprised the london company and the plymouth company these two privately funded ventures were intended to claim land for england to conduct trade and to return a profit in 1620 pilgrims from the mayflower established plymouth colony in present-day massachusetts beginning the history of permanent european settlement in new england{16]plymouth council for new england{edit]main articles: plymouth council for new england connecticut colony and colony of rhode island and providence plantationstitle page of john smith's a description of new england (1616)in 1616 english explorer john smith named the region "new england"{17] the name was officially sanctioned on november 3 1620{18] when the charter of the virginia company of plymouth was replaced by a royal charter for the plymouth council for new england a joint-stock company established to colonize and govern the region{19] as the first colonists arrived in plymouth they wrote and signed the mayflower compact{20] their first governing document{21] the massachusetts bay colony came to dominate the area and was established by royal charter in 1629{22]{23] with its major town and port of boston established in 1630{24]massachusetts puritans began to settle in connecticut as early as 1633{25] roger williams was banished from massachusetts for heresy led a group south and founded providence plantation in the area that became the colony of rhode island and providence plantations in 1636{26]{27] at this time vermont was yet unsettled and the territories of new hampshire and maine were claimed and governed by massachusetts{28]french and indian wars{edit]an early english map of new england c 1670 depicts the area around modern portsmouth new hampshirerelationships between colonists and local indian tribes alternated between peace and armed skirmishes the bloodiest of which was the pequot war in 1637 which resulted in the mystic massacre{29] on may 19 1643 the colonies of massachusetts bay plymouth new haven and connecticut joined together in a loose compact called the new england confederation (officially "the united colonies of new england") the confederation was designed largely to coordinate mutual defense and gained some importance during king philip's war{30] from june 1675 through april 1678 king philip's war pitted the colonists and their indian allies against a widespread indian uprising resulting in killings and massacres on both sides{31]during the next 74 years there were six colonial wars that took place primarily between new england and new france (see the french and indian wars as well as father rale's war and father le loutre's war) throughout these wars new england was allied with the iroquois confederacy and new france was allied with the wabanaki confederacy after the new england conquest of acadia in 1710 mainland nova scotia was under the control of new england but both present-day new brunswick and virtually all of present-day maine remained contested territory between new england and new france after the british won the war in 1763 the connecticut river valley was opened for british settlement into western new hampshire and what is today vermontthe new england colonies were settled primarily by farmers who became relatively self-sufficient later new england's economy began to focus on crafts and trade aided by the puritan work ethic in contrast to the southern colonies which focused on agricultural production while importing finished goods from england{32]dominion of new england{edit]main articles: dominion of new england american revolutionary war american revolution and boston campaignthe new england ensign one of several flags historically associated with new england this flag was reportedly used by colonial merchant ships sailing out of new england ports 1686 xe2x80x93 c 1737{33]{34]{35]{36]{37]new england's siege of louisbourg (1745) by peter monamyby 1686 king james ii had become concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies including their self-governing charters their open flouting of the navigation acts and their growing military power he therefore established the dominion of new england an administrative union comprising all of the new england colonies{38] in 1688 the former dutch colonies of new york east new jersey and west new jersey were added to the dominion the union was imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region and it was highly unpopular among the colonists{39]the dominion significantly modified the charters of the colonies including the appointment of royal governors to nearly all of them there was an uneasy tension between the royal governors their officers and the elected governing bodies of the colonies the governors wanted unlimited authority and the different layers of locally elected officials would often resist them in most cases the local town governments continued operating as self-governing bodies just as they had before the appointment of the governors{40]after the glorious revolution in 1689 bostonians overthrew royal governor sir edmund andros they seized dominion officials and adherents to the church of england during a popular and bloodless uprising{41] these tensions eventually culminated in the american revolution boiling over with the outbreak of the war of american independence in 1775 the first battles of the war were fought in lexington and concord massachusetts later leading to the siege of boston by continental troops in march 1776 british forces were compelled to retreat from bostonnew england in the new nation{edit]boston college: the architecture style is collegiate gothic a subgenre of gothic revival architecture a 19th-century movementpost-revolutionary new england{edit]after the dissolution of the dominion of new england the colonies of new england ceased to function as a unified political unit but remained a defined cultural region by 1784 all of the states in the region had taken steps towards the abolition of slavery with vermont and massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783 respectively{42] the nickname "yankeeland" was sometimes used to denote the new england area especially among southerners and british{43]after settling a dispute with new york vermont was admitted to statehood in 1791 formally completing the defined area of new england on march 15 1820 as part of the missouri compromise the territory of maine formerly a part of massachusetts was admitted to the union as a free state{44] today new england is defined as the six states of connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont{5]for the rest of the period before the american civil war new england remained distinct from the rest of the united states new england's economic growth relied heavily on trade with the british empire{45] and the region's merchants and politicians strongly opposed trade restrictions as the united states and the united kingdom fought the war of 1812 new england federalists organized the hartford convention in the winter of 1814 to discuss the region's grievances concerning the war and to propose changes to the constitution to protect the region's interests and maintain its political power{46] radical delegates within the convention proposed the region's secession from the united states but they were outnumbered by moderates who opposed the idea{47]politically the region often disagreed with the rest of the country{48] massachusetts and connecticut were among the last refuges of the federalist party and new england became the strongest bastion of the new whig party when the second party system began in the 1830s the whigs were usually dominant throughout new england except in the more democratic maine and new hampshire leading statesmen hailed from the region including daniel websternew england was distinct in other ways as well many notable literary and intellectual figures were new englanders produced by the united states before the american civil war including ralph waldo emerson henry david thoreau nathaniel hawthorne henry wadsworth longfellow john greenleaf whittier george bancroft and william h prescott{49]industrial revolution{edit]the slater mill historic site in pawtucket rhode islandnew england was key to the industrial revolution in the united states{50] the blackstone valley running through massachusetts and rhode island has been called the birthplace of america's industrial revolution{51] in 1787 the first cotton mill in america was founded in the north shore seaport of beverly massachusetts as the beverly cotton manufactory{52] the manufactory was also considered the largest cotton mill of its time technological developments and achievements from the manufactory led to the development of more advanced cotton mills including slater mill in pawtucket rhode island towns such as lawrence massachusetts lowell massachusetts woonsocket rhode island and lewiston maine became centers of the textile industry following the innovations at slater mill and the beverly cotton manufactory{citation needed]the connecticut river valley became a crucible for industrial innovation particularly the springfield armory pioneering such advances as interchangeable parts and the assembly line which influenced manufacturing processes all around the world{53] from early in the nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth the region surrounding springfield massachusetts and hartford connecticut served as the united states' epicenter for advanced manufacturing drawing skilled workers from all over the world{54]{55]the rapid growth of textile manufacturing in new england between 1815 and 1860 caused a shortage of workers recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories between 1830 and 1860 thousands of farm girls moved from rural areas where there was no paid employment to work in the nearby mills such as the famous lowell mill girls as the textile industry grew immigration also grew by the 1850s immigrants began working in the mills especially irish and french canadians{56]new england as a whole was the most industrialized part of the us by 1850 the region accounted for well over a quarter of all manufacturing value in the country and over a third of its industrial workforce{57] it was also the most literate and most educated region in the country{57]anti-slavery{edit]during the same period new england and areas settled by new englanders (upstate new york ohio's western reserve and the upper midwestern states of michigan and wisconsin) were the center of the strongest abolitionist and anti-slavery movements in the united states coinciding with the protestant great awakening in the region{58] abolitionists who demanded immediate emancipation such as william lloyd garrison john greenleaf whittier and wendell phillips had their base in the region so too did anti-slavery politicians who wanted to limit the growth of slavery such as john quincy adams charles sumner and john p hale when the anti-slavery republican party was formed in the 1850s all of new england including areas that had previously been strongholds for both the whig and the democratic parties became strongly republican new england remained solidly republican until catholics began to mobilize behind the democrats especially in 1928 and up until the republican party realigned its politics in a shift known as the southern strategy this led to the end of "yankee republicanism" and began new england's relatively swift transition into a consistently democratic stronghold{59]20th century and beyond{edit]autumn in new england watercolor maurice prendergast c 1910xe2x80x931913the flow of immigrants continued at a steady pace from the 1840s until cut off by world war i the largest numbers came from ireland and britain before 1890 and after that from quebec italy and southern europe the immigrants filled the ranks of factory workers craftsmen and unskilled laborers the irish assumed a larger and larger role in the democratic parts in the cities and statewide while the rural areas remained republican yankees left the farms which never were highly productive; many headed west while others became professionals and businessmen in the new england citiesgreat depression{edit]the great depression in the united states of the 1930s hit the region hard with high unemployment in the industrial cities the democrats appealed to factory workers and especially catholics pulling them into the new deal coalition and making the once-republican region into one that was closely divided however the enormous spending on munitions ships electronics and uniforms during world war ii caused a burst of prosperity in every sectordeindustrialization{edit]fall foliage in the town of stowe vermontthe region lost most of its factories starting with the loss of textiles in the 1930s and getting worse after 1960 the new england economy was radically transformed after world war ii the factory economy practically disappeared like urban centers in the rust belt once-bustling new england communities fell into economic decay following the flight of the region's industrial base the textile mills one by one went out of business from the 1920s to the 1970s for example the crompton company after 178 years in business went bankrupt in 1984 costing the jobs of 2450 workers in five states the major reasons were cheap imports the strong dollar declining exports and a failure to diversify{60] shoes followedalexander king house in suffield connecticutwhat remains is very high

roles in the fields of education medicine and medical research high-technology finance and tourism{62]some industrial areas were slow in adjusting to the new service economy in 2000 new england had two of the ten poorest cities (by percentage living below the poverty line) in the us: the state capitals of providence rhode island and hartford connecticut{63] they were no longer in the bottom ten by 2010; connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire remain among the ten wealthiest states in the united states in terms of median household income and per capita income{64]cities and urban

distant from the geographic center of the country and is a relatively small region and relatively densely populated it historically has been an important center of industrial manufacturing and a supplier of natural resource products such as granite lobster and codfish new england exports food products ranging from fish to lobster cranberries maine potatoes and maple syrup the service industry is important including tourism education financial and insurance services plus architectural building and construction services the us department of commerce has called the new england economy a microcosm for the entire us economy{91]in the first half of the 20th century the region underwent a long period of deindustrialization as traditional manufacturing companies relocated to the midwest with textile and furniture manufacturing migrating to the south in the mid-to-late 20th century an increasing portion of the regional economy included high technology (including computer and electronic equipment manufacturing) military defense industry finance and insurance services as well as education and health servicesas of 2015 the gdp of new england was 9539

democratic every election since maine and vermont were the only two states in the nation to vote against democrat franklin d roosevelt all four times he ran for president republicans in new england
