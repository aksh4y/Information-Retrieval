second major hurricane of the season isabel formed near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave on september 6 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165xc2xa0mph (265xc2xa0kmh) on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next dayin north carolina the storm surge from isabel washed out a portion of hatteras island to form what was unofficially known as isabel inlet damage was greatest along the outer banks where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed the worst of the effects of isabel occurred in virginia especially in the hampton roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as richmond and washington dc virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane about 64 of the damage and 68 of the deaths occurred in north carolina and virginia electric service was disrupted in areas of virginia for several days some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damagemoderate to severe damage extended up the atlantic coastline and as far inland as west virginia roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern united states from the strong winds of isabel rainfall from the storm extended

tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on september 1{2] an area of low pressure associated with the wave moved slowly westward and its convection initially appeared to become better organized{3] on september 3 as it passed to the south of the cape verde islands organization within the system degraded{4] though convection increased the next day{5] the system gradually became better organized and dvorak classifications began early on september 5 based on the development of a closed surface circulation it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression thirteen early on september 6 hours later it intensified into tropical storm isabel{2] though operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until 13xc2xa0hours after it first developed{6]located within an area of light wind shear and warm waters isabel gradually organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center{7] it steadily strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest and isabel strengthened to a hurricane on september 7 subsequent to the development of a large yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection{8] the eye overall convective pattern and outflow steadily improved in organization{9] and deep convection quickly surrounded the 40-mile (60xc2xa0km)-wide eye{10] isabel intensified on september 8 to reach major hurricane status while located 1300xc2xa0miles (2100xc2xa0km) east-northeast of barbuda on september 9 isabel reached a primary peak intensity of 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) for around 24xc2xa0hours a minimal categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{2]the eye of hurricane isabel as seen from the international space stationbroader view from the international space stationearly on september 10 the eyewall became less defined the convection near the eye became eroded and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted{11] as a result isabel weakened slightly to a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane the hurricane turned more to the west due to the influence of the bermuda-azores high{2] later on september 10 isabel restrengthened to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall{12] the hurricane continued to intensify and isabel reached its peak intensity of 165xc2xa0mph (270xc2xa0kmh) on september 11 a category 5 hurricane on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{2] due to an eyewall replacement cycle isabel weakened slightly though it retained categoryxc2xa05 status for 24xc2xa0hours{13] as isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened{14] and early on september 13 isabel weakened to a strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane a weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest{2] after completing the replacement cycle the hurricane's large 40xc2xa0mile (65xc2xa0km) wide eye became better defined{15] and late on the 13th isabel re-attained categoryxc2xa05 status{2] a noaa hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of 233xc2xa0mph (375xc2xa0kmh) the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an atlantic hurricane{16] cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter{17] and isabel weakened to a strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane early on september 14 later that day it re-organized and for the third time it attained categoryxc2xa05 status while located 400xc2xa0miles (650xc2xa0km) north of san juan puerto rico{2]cloud tops around the center warmed again early on september 15 and isabel weakened to a category 4 hurricane{2] later that day the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance as a ridge to its northwest build southeastward it resulted in isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest{18] increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further and isabel weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on september 16 while located 645xc2xa0miles (1035xc2xa0km) southeast of cape hatteras north carolina{2] convection remained minimal though outflow retained excellent organization{19] and isabel remained a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane for twoxc2xa0days until it made landfall between cape lookout and ocracoke island on september 18 with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) it weakened after it made landfall though due to its fast forward motion isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western virginia early on september 19 after passing through west virginia as a tropical storm isabel became extratropical over western pennsylvania near pittsburgh the system crossed lake erie into canada early on september 20 the extratropial remnant of isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the cochrane district of ontario{2]preparations{edit]hurricane isabel making landfall in north carolina on september 18two days before isabel made landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch from little river south carolina to chincoteague virginia including the pamlico and albemarle sounds and the lower chesapeake bay the nhc also issued a tropical storm watch south of little river south carolina to the mouth of the santee river as well as from chincoteague virginia northward to little egg inlet new jersey hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the east coast of the united states by the time isabel made landfall a tropical storm warning existed from chincoteague virginia to fire island new york and from cape fear north carolina to the mouth of the santee river in south carolina and a hurricane warning existed from chincoteague virginia to cape fear landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36xc2xa0miles (58xc2xa0km) and for 48xc2xa0hours in advance the average track error was 18xc2xa0miles (29xc2xa0km){2]officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24xc2xa0counties in north carolina virginia and maryland though in general not many left according to a survey conducted by the united states department of commerce evacuation rates were estimated as follows; 45 in the outer banks 23 in the area around the pamlico sound 23 in virginia and about 15 in maryland{20] the threat of isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents primarily in north carolina and virginia and included more than 12000xc2xa0residents staying in emergency shelters{21]19 major airports along the east coast of the united states were closed with more than 1500xc2xa0flights canceled the washington metro and metrobus system closed prior to the arrival of the storm and amtrak canceled nearly all trains south of the nation's capital schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to isabel's arrival to allow time to prepare; hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood flashlights batteries and portable generators as residents prepared for the storm's potential impact the federal government was closed excluding emergency staff members{21] the united states navy ordered the removal of 40xc2xa0ships and submarines and dozens of aircraft from naval sites near norfolk virginia{22]a contingency plan was established at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery that should the winds exceed 120mph the guards could take positions in the trophy room (above the tomb plaza and providing continual sight of the tomb) but the plan was never implemented however it spawned an urban legend that the third infantry sent orders to seek shelter orders that were deliberately disobeyed{23]on september 18 the canadian hurricane centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for portions of southern ontario a gale warning was also issued for lake ontario eastern lake erie the saint lawrence river and georgian bay{24]{25]{26] a news report on september 14 warned conditions could be similar to the disaster caused by hurricane hazel 49xc2xa0years prior resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane{27] researchers on a convair 580 flight studied the structure of isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm after two similar studies for hurricane michael in 2000 and tropical storm karen in 2001 while flying in a thunderstorm ice build forced the plane to descend{28]impact{edit]deaths

the soil downed many trees and power lines across its path leaving about 6xc2xa0million electricity customers without power at some point parts of coastal virginia especially in the hampton roads and northeast north carolina areas were without electricity for almost a month coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge with areas in eastern north carolina and southeast virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge throughout its path isabel resulted in 36xc2xa0billion in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 469xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) and 51xc2xa0deaths of which 16 were directly related to the storm's effects{29]the governors of pennsylvania west virginia maryland new jersey and delaware declared states of emergency{21] isabel was the first major hurricane to threaten the mid-atlantic states and the upper south since hurricane floyd in september 1999 isabel's greatest effect was due to flood damage the worst in some areas of virginia since 1972's hurricane agnes more than 60xc2xa0million people were affected to some degreexe2x80x94a similar number to floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent memory{30]caribbean and southeast united states{edit]rainfall totals from hurricane isabelpowerful surf affected the northern coastlines of the islands in the greater antilles strong swells also lashed the bahamas during most hurricanes the location of the bahamas prevents powerful swells of atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast florida however the combination of the location forward speed and strength of isabel produced strong swells through the providence channel onto a narrow 10xc2xa0mile (16xc2xa0km) stretch of the southeastern florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14xc2xa0feet (43xc2xa0m) at delray beach{16] the swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twoxc2xa0passengers at boynton beach and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near juno beach minor beach erosion was reported in palm beach county{31] in the northern portion of the state waves reached up to 15xc2xa0feet (45xc2xa0m) in height at flagler beach causing the flagler beach pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves{32] rip currents from isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in nassau county with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents{33] the beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf{34]in northeastern south carolina the outer rainbands produced moderate winds reaching 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) at myrtle beach rainfall was light peaking at 134xc2xa0inches (34xc2xa0mm) in loris{35]north carolina{edit]main article: effects of hurricane isabel in north carolinaisabel produced moderate to heavy damage across eastern north carolina totaling 450xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 586xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){2] damage was heaviest in dare county where storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses{36] the storm surge produced a 2000xc2xa0foot (600xc2xa0m) wide inlet on hatteras island unofficially known as isabel inlet isolating hatteras by road for two months{37] strong winds downed hundreds of trees of across the state leaving up to 700000xc2xa0residents without power most areas with power outages had power restored within a few days{36] the hurricane directly killed one person and indirectly killed two in the state{38]virginia{edit]main article: effects of hurricane isabel in virginiaflood waters at langley afb hampton virginia as a result of hurricane isabelthe storm surge assailed much of southeastern virginia causing the worst flooding seen in the area since the 1933 chesapeakexe2x80x93potomac hurricane peaking at an estimated 9xc2xa0feet (27xc2xa0m) in richmond along the james river the surge caused significant damage to homes along river ways{39] especially along the middle reaches of the james river basin{40] the strong storm surge surpassed the floodgate to the midtown tunnel while workers attempted to close the gate; about 44xc2xa0million us gallons (170000xc2xa0m3) of water flooded the tunnel entirely in just 40xc2xa0minutes with the workers barely able to escape{41] the damage to the electrical grid and flooding kept old dominion university norfolk state university virginia commonwealth university and many of the region's other major educational institutions closed for almost a week further inland heavy rainfall was reported peaking at 202xc2xa0inches (513xc2xa0mm) in sherando virginia{40] causing damage and severe flash flooding winds from the hurricane destroyed over 1000xc2xa0houses and damaged 9000xc2xa0more;{42] damage in the state totaled about 185xc2xa0billion (2003xc2xa0usd 241xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) among the costliest tropical cyclones in virginia history{20] the passage of isabel also resulted in 32xc2xa0deaths in the state 10xc2xa0directly from the storm's effects and 22xc2xa0indirectly related{2]mid-atlantic{edit]main articles: effects of hurricane isabel in maryland and washington dc and effects of hurricane isabel in delawareabout 124xc2xa0million people lost power throughout maryland and washington dc the worst of isabel's effects came from its storm surge which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion in eastern maryland hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the storm surge and related tidal flooding the most severe flooding occurred in the southern portions of dorchester and somerset counties and on kent island in queen anne's county thousands of houses were affected in central maryland with severe storm surge flooding reported in baltimore and annapolis washington dc sustained moderate damage primarily from the winds throughout maryland and washington damage totaled about 945xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 123xc2xa0billion 2017xc2xa0usd) with only one direct fatality due to flooding{43]{44]{45]{46]the effects of the hurricane in delaware were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of tropical storm henri days before{47] moderate winds of up to 62xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) in lewes{48] downed numerous trees tree limbs and power lines across the state{49] leaving at least 15300 without power{50] numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf strong storm surge or run-off from flooding further inland{49] the passage of hurricane isabel resulted in 40xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 521xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) and no casualties in the state{2]northeast united states{edit]hurricane isabel's extratropical

winds from isabel downed hundreds of trees and power lines across new jersey leaving hundreds of thousands without power; a falling tree killed one person rough waves and a moderate storm surge along the coastline caused moderate to severe beach erosion and one person was killed from the rough waves damage in the state totaled 50xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 651xc2xa0million

pennsylvania{2] one person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages{53] moderate winds left about 14xc2xa0million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees{54]{55]{56]damage in new york totaled 90xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 117xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){2] with vermont reporting about 100000 in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 130000 2017xc2xa0usd){57]{58]{59]{60]{61]{62] falling trees from moderate winds downed power lines across the region causing sporadic power outages two people died in the region as a result of the hurricane both due to the rough surf from isabel{2]elsewhere{edit]in west virginia the storm produced moderate rainfall across the state that peaked at 688xc2xa0in (175xc2xa0mm) near sugar grove{63] the rainfall resulted in mudslides and flash flooding covering several roads and washing away two bridges the south branch potomac river crested at 247xc2xa0feet (75xc2xa0m) 93xc2xa0feet (28xc2xa0m) above flood state near springfield the flooding broke a levee at michael field and in mineral county onexc2xa0school and 14xc2xa0basements were flooded in jefferson county two people required rescue after a car drove into floodwaters{64] although sustained winds were weak in the state wind gusts reached 46xc2xa0mph (74xc2xa0kmh) at martinsburg with the wet grounds the wind gusts toppled thousands of trees which fell onto homes roads and power lines{64] about 14xc2xa0million residents across the state were left without power{65] damage in the state totaled 20xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 26xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) no deaths were reported{2] and three were injured from the hurricane{64]isabel dropped light to moderate precipitation across the eastern half of ohio with isolated locations reporting over 3xc2xa0in (75xc2xa0mm){40] moisture from isabel dropped light rainfall across eastern michigan and peaked at 155xc2xa0inches (39xc2xa0mm) at mount clemens additionally doppler weather radar estimated rainfall approached 25xc2xa0inches (64xc2xa0mm) in st clair county no damage was reported from isabel in the region{66]swells from isabel produced moderate surf along the atlantic coast of nova scotia particularly in the gulf of maine{24] isabel also produced rough surf in lake ontario with waves reaching 4xc2xa0m (13xc2xa0ft) along the western portion at hamilton the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets{28] rainfall peaked at 59xc2xa0mm (23xc2xa0in) which caused minor flooding and led to one traffic fatality about 27000xc2xa0people lost power mostly near toronto{67] the strong pressure gradient between isabel and a high pressure system over eastern canada produced strong easterly winds across lakes ontario and erie{28] a buoy in lake ontario reported a peak gust of 78xc2xa0kmh (49xc2xa0mph){68] and gusts reached as strong as 81xc2xa0kmh (51xc2xa0mph) at port colborne ontario{2]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesdamage to the barrier islands after hurricane isabel (usgs)by about a week after the passage of the hurricane president george w bush declared disaster areas for 36xc2xa0north carolina counties 77xc2xa0counties and independent cities in virginia the entire state of maryland all three counties in delaware and six west virginia counties the disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane isabel{20] by about four months after the passage of the hurricane disaster aid totaled about 516xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 672xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) primarily in north carolina and virginia over 166000 residents applied for individual assistance with about 117xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 152xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs about 50000xc2xa0business owners applied for small business administration loans with about 178xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 232xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) approved for the assistance loans about 40000xc2xa0people visited local disaster recovery centers designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane{69]{70]{71]{72]{73]in north carolina hundreds of residents were stranded in hatteras following the formation of isabel inlet{74] people who were not residents were not allowed to be on the outer banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions when visitors were allowed to return many ventured to see the new inlet despite a 1-mile (16-km) walk from the nearest road{37] initially long term solutions to the isabel inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes{75] dredging operations began on october 17 about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane{76] on november 22 about two months after the hurricane struck north carolina highway 12 and hatteras island were reopened to public access on the same day the ferry between hatteras and ocracoke was reopened{37]in west virginia the power outages were restored within a week{77] power workers throughout canada assisted the severely affected power companies from maryland to north carolina{78] hydro-quxc3xa9bec sent 25xc2xa0teams to the new york city area to assist in power outages{79]retirement{edit]because of widespread property damage and extensive death tolls the name isabel was retired after the 2003 season and will not be used for future atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by ida for the naming list for the 2009 season{80] the names ina and ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names{81]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portal1933 chesapeakexe2x80x93potomac hurricaneannular hurricanehurricane franhurricane hazelhurricane hugohurricane
