caribs are an indigenous people of the lesser antilles in the caribbean they may have descended from the mainland caribs (kalina) of south america but they spoke an unrelated language known as island caribat the time of spanish contact the caribs were one of the dominant groups in the caribbean which owes its name to them they lived throughout the windward islands dominica and possibly the southern leeward islands historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland caribs known as the igneri the igneri had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants however linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the island carib language appears not to have been cariban but arawakan like that of their neighbors the taxc3xadno irving rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a south american origin{3]in the early colonial period the caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands it was claimed that they practiced cannibalism xe2x80x93 the word "cannibal" derives from a corruption of their name{4] according to the spanish conquistadores the carib indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh archaeological evidence indicates that they limited the consumption of humans to ceremonial occasions there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both carib and other amerindian groups such as the arawak and tupinamba today the caribs and their descendants continue to live in the antilles the garifuna or " black caribs" a group of mixed carib and african ancestry

carbon dating{citation needed] over the two centuries leading up to christopher columbus' arrival in the caribbean archipelago in 1492 the caribs mostly displaced the maipurean-speaking taxc3xadnos by warfare extermination and assimilation the taxc3xadno had settled the island chains earlier in history migrating from the mainland{5]greenstone ceremonial axe from shell midden mt irvine bay tobago 1957caribs traded with the eastern taxc3xadno of the caribbean islandsthe caribs produced the silver products which ponce de leon found in taxc3xadno communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfareaccording to floyd "the question arose in columbus's time whether indians could be enslaved and queen isabel had ruled against it at about the same time however ojeda bastidas and other explorers voyaging along the spanish main had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows - all such indians were considered caribs - which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs" on 3 june 1511 king ferdinand declared war on the caribs{6] island caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by spaniardsin the 17th century island caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of european invaders: french and english most fatalities resulted from eurasian infectious diseases such as smallpox which they had no natural immunity to as well as warfarein 1660 france and england signed with island caribs the treaty of saint charles that stipulated that caribs would evacuate all the lesser antilles except for dominica and saint vincent which were recognized as reserves however the english would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763{7] to this date a small population of around 3000 caribs survives in the carib territory in northeast dominicathe 'black caribs' (later known as carifuna) of st vincent (st vincent has some "yellow caribs" as well) were descended from a group of enslaved africans who were marooned from shipwrecks of slave ships as well as slaves who escaped here chief kairouane and his men from grenada jumped off of the xe2x80x9cleapers hill" rather than face slavery under the french invaders and have served as an iconic representation of the caribs spirit of resistance{8]{9]{10] they intermarried with the carib and formed the last native culture to resist the british it was not until 1795 that british colonists deported the black caribs to roatan island off honduras their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the garifuna ethnic group carib resistance delayed the settlement of dominica by europeans the black carib communities that remained in st vincent and dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th centurythe last known speakers of island carib died in the 1930s and the language is extinctpeople{edit]the kalinago of dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island's rugged terrain the island's east coast includes a 3700-acre (15xc2xa0km2) territory formerly known as the carib territory that was granted to the people by the british crown in 1903 there are only 3000 caribs remaining they elect their own chief in july 2003

if you can (november 2015) (learn how and when to remove this template message)the island caribs were of a medium height but in general were of a taller stature than the arawaks they were described as being stronger than the arawaks reportedly due to the emphasis placed on training for warfare their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and it was very rare for their loins to be covered the women painted their skin with a red dye called roucou which they used to make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearerreligion{edit]the caribs are believed to have been polytheists as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to catholicism{12]the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the taxc3xadno they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their shamans called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells (piai) which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other native americans the caribs smoked tobacco in the rituals of their religionsocial organization{edit]early carib culture was patriarchal women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried out the tasks of hunting for food and protecting women and children from attack by other warring tribes in the 17th century europeans reported that the women with their children lived in separate houses from men a custom recorded among other south american tribes{citation needed]the women were highly revered and held substantial socio-political power{13] island carib society was reputedly more socially egalitarian than taxc3xadno society although there were village chiefs and war leaders there were no large states or multi-tiered aristocracy the local self-government unit may have been the longhouse dwellings populated by men or women typically run by one or more chieftains reporting to an island councilfood{edit]the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein: they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet - they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid{14] in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou  a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings{14]music{edit]this section

america the most famous form is punta its associated musical style which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion an evolved form of traditional music still usually played using traditional instruments punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called punta rock traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive artists like pen cayetano helped innovate modern punta rock by adding guitars to the traditional music and paved the way for later artists like andy palacio children of the most high and black coral punta was popular across the region especially in belize by the mid-1980s culminating in the release of punta rockers in 1987 a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest starsother forms of garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu combination wanaragua abaimahani matamuerte laremuna wadaguman gunjai sambai charikanari eremuna egi paranda berusu punta rock teremuna ligilisi arumahani and mali-amalihani punta is the most popular dance in garifuna culture it is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events punta lyrics are usually composed by the women chumba and hunguhungu are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm which is often combined with punta there are other songs typical to each gender women having eremwu eu and abaimajani rhythmic a cappella songs and laremuna wadaguman men's work songs chumba and hunguhungu a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm which is often combined with puntadrums play a very important role in garifuna music there are primarily two types of drums used: the primero (tenor drum) and the segunda (bass drum) these drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig) deer or sheepalso used in combination with the drums are the sisera these shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree filled with seeds then fitted with hardwood handlesparanda music developed soon after the garifunas arrival in central america the music is instrumental and percussion-based the music was barely recorded until the 1990s when ivan duran of stonetree records began the paranda projectin contemporary belize there has been a resurgence of garifuna music popularized by musicians such as andy palacio mohobub flores  adrian martinez these musicians have taken many aspects from traditional garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda one great example is andy palacio's album watina and umalali: the garifuna women's project both released on the belizean record label stonetree recordsin the garifuna culture there is another dance called dugu this dance is a ritual done for a death in the family to pay their respect to their loved ones in 2001 garifuna music was proclaimed one of the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by unescocannibalism{edit]this section appears to contradict itself please see the talk page for more information (may 2016)carib warrior (mixed media sculpture by artist george s stuart)the island carib word karibna meant "person" it became the origin of the english "cannibal"{15] although among the caribs it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both arawak and other amerindian groups such as the carib and tupinamba {16]the caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses missionaries such as pxc3xa8re jean baptiste labat and cesar de rochefort described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants the caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribesitalian explorer giovanni da verrazzano was killed and said to have been eaten by carib natives on what is now guadeloupe (french west indies) in 1528 (before called karukera by the amerindian people which means xe2x80x9cthe island of beautiful watersxe2x80x9d) during his third voyage to north america after exploring florida the bahamas and the lesser antilles historian william riviere{17] has described most of the cannibalism as related to war ritualskalinago canoe project{edit]in 1997 dominica artist jacob frederick and tortola artist aragorn dick read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in dominica guadeloupe and martinique the project consisted of a return voyage by canoe to the orinoco delta to meet up with the kalinago tribes still living in those parts on the way a cultural assessment was carried out and ties were reestablished with the remaining communities along the island chain a documentary the quest of the carib canoe was made by the bbc{18] the expedition sent shock waves through the lesser antilles as it made the local governments aware of the presence and the struggles for cultural survival of the kalinagosee also{edit]carib expulsionsanta rosa carib
