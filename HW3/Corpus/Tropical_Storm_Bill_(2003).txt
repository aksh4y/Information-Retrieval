seasontropical storm bill was a tropical storm that affected the gulf coast of the united states in the summer of 2003 the second storm of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season bill developed from a tropical wave on june 29 to the north of the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula it slowly organized as it moved northward and reached a peak of 60 miles per hour (97xc2xa0kmh) shortly before making landfall in south-central louisiana bill quickly weakened over land and as it accelerated to the northeast moisture from the storm combined with cold air from an approaching cold front produced an outbreak of 34xc2xa0tornadoes bill became extratropical on july 2 and was absorbed by the cold front later that dayupon making landfall on louisiana the storm produced a moderate storm surge causing tidal flooding in a city in the northeastern portion of the state the surge breached a levee which flooded many homes in the town moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees which then hit a few houses and power lines and left hundreds of thousands without electric power two people drowned from rough surf in florida further inland tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage throughout its path tropical storm bill caused around 50xc2xa0million in damage (2003xc2xa0usd) and four deathscontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 western gulf coast32 eastern gulf coast33 southeastern us4 aftermath5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central caribbean sea on june 24 while interacting with an upper-level low it moved slowly northwestward{1] and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear{2] late on june 27 the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{3] the area of low pressure became better defined over the central yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and after the system turned to the northwest convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico on june 29 following the development of a closed circulation the system organized into tropical depression three while located about 40 miles (64xc2xa0km) north of progreso yucatxc3xa1n{4]radar image of tropical storm bill's landfall in louisianathe depression quickly strengthened to become tropical storm bill later on june 29 operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status{4] initially the system resembled a subtropical cyclone with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins{5] the storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased{4] and early forecasts from the national hurricane center mentioned the possibility of bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection bill turned to the north-northwest and later to the north as it moved around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure{6] on june 30 tropical storm bill reached a peak intensity of 60 miles per hour (97xc2xa0kmh) one hour before making landfall in southwestern terrebonne parish louisiana it moved onshore at peak intensity and quickly weakened to a depression over land as it accelerated to the northeast bill remained a tropical cyclone as it moved through the southeast united states{4] until it became attached to an approaching cold front on july 2 near the tennesseexe2x80x93virginia border{7] the remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by the cold front on july 3 near central virginia{4] while the remnant low pressure area continued northeastward until reaching the atlantic ocean later on july 3{8]preparations{edit]shortly after the storm formed the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch from the southern end of galveston island to morgan city louisiana as a more northward motion occurred the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from high island texas to pascagoula mississippi shortly before the storm made landfall the warning was discontinued between high island and cameron louisiana the national hurricane center briefly issued a hurricane watch from intracoastal city to morgan city but it was discontinued when tropical storm bill failed to strengthen{4] prior the storm making landfall local national weather service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the gulf coast{9]the threat of tropical storm bill caused 41xc2xa0oil platforms and 11xc2xa0oil rigs to evacuate this resulted in a loss of production of over 71 thousand barrels (11300xc2xa0m3) of oil and 610xc2xa0million cubic feet (17000000xc2xa0m3) of gas{10]the american red cross mobilized workers and brought food water and other supplies to louisiana prior to the storm's arrival at the request of louisiana emergency management officials the organization opened two shelters for residents in low-lying areas several floodgates in new orleans were closed before the storm made landfall and many universities and government offices were closed as well parishes along the coastline closed summer camps and prepared sand bags boats and high-wheeled vehicles{9] officials declared a voluntary evacuation for grand isle though few residents heeded the recommendation{11] louisiana governor mike foster declared a statewide state of emergency to easily make state resources available and mississippi governor ronnie musgrove made a similar declaration for harrison hancock and jackson counties where shelters were also opened{12] officials in mississippi ordered the evacuation of flood-prone areas in anticipation for a moderate storm surge and above-normal tides{9]impact{edit]bill caused four direct deaths along its path as well as minor to moderate damage damage estimates totaled to over 50xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 651xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage throughout its path bill spawned 34 tornadoes ranking it fourteenth in the list of north atlantic hurricanes generating the most tornadoes{13] the tornado outbreak was caused by wind shear moist air from the storm and cool air from an approaching cold front{14] in spite of the large numbers of tornadoes most were weak and short-lived{15] prior to forming the storm produced rainfall along coastal areas of mexico along the bay of campeche peaking at nearly 4 inches (100xc2xa0mm) in yucatxc3xa1n and over 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) in campeche{16]western gulf coast{edit]rainfall totals from tropical storm billthe outer bands of bill dropped light rain across southeastern texas peaking at 107 inches (27xc2xa0mm) in jamaica beach sustained winds from the storm remained weak and peak wind gusts were 20 miles per hour (32xc2xa0kmh) in eastern galveston county upon making landfall bill caused a storm surge of up to 381 feet (116xc2xa0m) at pleasure pier effects in texas were minimal limited to minor beach erosion on the bolivar peninsula{17]a moderate storm surge accompanied tropical storm bill as it made landfall on louisiana in the state the maximum reported surge was 58 feet (18xc2xa0m) and it occurred at the louisiana universities marine consortium facility in chauvin{18] in montegut the surge breached a levee which was still damaged from the effects of hurricane lili 9xc2xa0months before the breach flooded many homes in the town{19] forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood{20] as a result 150xc2xa0homes in the town were damaged with half of them severely{21] the storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern louisiana by flooding roadways{19] including the only road to grand isle stranding residents and visitors the road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded{22] the floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in st tammany parish damage from the storm surge totaled 41xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd){19] rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued{22]the tornado outbreak associated with the storm began with an f0 in st bernard parish that destroyed a boat house{23] a short-lived f1 tornado touched down in reserve striking a private high school where it destroyed half of one classroom and damaged several others later the f1 tornado passed through a trailer park and severely damaged or destroyed 20xc2xa0trailers one trailer with a woman and three children was lifted into the air and dropped 30 feet (91xc2xa0m) away; four occupants were injured none of them seriously damage from the tornado amounted to 2xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 26xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){24] a third tornado rated an f0 struck orleans parish damaging a car and a portion of a roof{25]winds of 35xc2xa0to 45xc2xa0mph (56xe2x80x9372xc2xa0kmh) were common across southeastern louisiana with the highest sustained wind being 53 miles per hour (85xc2xa0kmh) in chauvin and a peak gust of 62 miles per hour (100xc2xa0kmh) on the northern end of the lake pontchartrain causeway{18] the winds knocked trees and tree branches into power lines{26] leaving 224000xc2xa0residents without power{22] the storm dropped moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation peaking at 102 inches (260xc2xa0mm) at a location 6 miles (97xc2xa0km) south of folsom{27] the rainfall led to flash flooding which inundated roads and cars and overwhelmed local drainage capacities{28] the rainfall also led to overflown rivers and creeks resulting in flooding along the tangipahoa river in southern tangipahoa parish and the bogue falaya and tchefuncte river in st tammany parish{29] the bogue falaya river crested at 57 feet (17xc2xa0m) on july 1 12 feet (37xc2xa0m) above flood stage which became a record for the recording station{26] the flooding damaged several structures and roadways less severe river flooding occurred in washington and livingston parishes{29] in all damage in louisiana totaled to 44xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 573xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){18]eastern gulf coast{edit]fujita scalef0f1f2f3f4f5upon making landfall bill produced a peak storm surge of 499 feet (152xc2xa0m) in waveland mississippi{30] the storm surge led to beach erosion damage to piers and flooded roadways with damage from the surge amounting to around 1xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 13xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd){31] the maximum sustained wind from the storm recorded in mississippi was 43 miles per hour (69xc2xa0kmh) at the gulfport-biloxi international airport while the airport and keesler air force base both reported a peak wind gust of 52 miles per hour (84xc2xa0kmh) tropical storm bill dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the state peaking at 949 inches (241xc2xa0mm) in van cleave{30] the moderate wind gusts along with the saturated ground downed trees in several locations 34xc2xa0roads in pike and walthall counties were blocked by fallen trees and two homes were damaged{32] additionally power outages were reported near the coast{4] the rainfall flooded streets in various portions of the state{33]{34] and led to overflown rivers{30] an overflown creek in pearl river county flooded structures and roadways{35] the outer rainbands of bill produced a weak tornado that touched down briefly in waveland blowing down several trees which resulted in minor damage to roofs{36] statewide damage accrued to 5xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 651xc2xa0million 2017xc2xa0usd) primarily from flooding{30]as tropical storm bill made landfall on louisiana its effects were felt in the alabama coast as well as heavy surf and tidal flooding pounded the coastline of the state high waters closed a road to dauphin island and portions of a road along mobile bay{37] bill dropped over 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) of rain across the southern half of alabama{38] with isolated locations receiving over 8 inches (200xc2xa0mm) due to wet conditions for months preceding the storm rainfall from bill led to flash flooding in many counties the deluge led to overflown rivers and streams and left several roadways temporarily impassable from high floodwaters saturated grounds and wind gusts of 30xc2xa0to 35xc2xa0mph (48xe2x80x9356xc2xa0kmh) downed numerous trees many downed trees landed on power lines which caused power outages for around 19000xc2xa0people one downed tree destroyed a car and another damaged a roof of a house in lee county a man was required to be rescued after driving through high flood waters{39] roadway flooding resulted in a few minor traffic accidents{9] also the outer bands of the storm spawned an f1 tornado in crenshaw county early in its path it was narrow and damage was limited to downed trees two destroyed sheds and a few houses experiencing light shingle damage or damage from fallen trees later it expanded to reach a width of 1800 feet (550xc2xa0m) as it moved northwestward the tornado destroyed the roofs of two houses one of which experienced damage to its walls the tornado dissipated eight minutes after its 3 miles (48xc2xa0km) path began resulting in 200000 in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 260xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd) and only slight injuries{40] a second tornado rated f0 in the fujita scale occurred in southwestern montgomery county a small tornado with a width of only 180 feet (55xc2xa0m) it moved to the northwest and tore down a few trees that fell onto a mobile home a house and two cars the tornado dissipated six minutes after its 5 miles (80xc2xa0km) path began{41] throughout alabama tropical storm bill caused around 300000 in damage (2003xc2xa0usd 391xc2xa0thousand 2017xc2xa0usd){39]{40]{41]rainfall from the storm began affecting florida a few days before the storm formed and locations in the southern portion of the state received over 3 inches (76xc2xa0mm) of rain{38] along the florida panhandle bill dropped over 8 inches (200xc2xa0mm) of rain as it made landfall{42] closing several roads{43] or leaving them impassable due to flooding{42] a stationary line of thunderstorms in okaloosa county produced downpours of up to 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) in one hour resulting in flash flooding which washed out a portion of a bridge{44] in bay county heavy rainfall and flooding damaged 40xc2xa0homes while several residents in an apartment in parker needed to be rescued by boat from the floodwaters{45] rough surf produced by the storm killed two swimmers at panama city beach while a dozen had to be rescued{46] part of the tornado outbreak spawned by the storm extended into northern florida{47] damage in florida totaled to around 1xc2xa0million (2003xc2xa0usd 13xc2xa0million

areas in southeastern georgia received generally around 1 inch (25xc2xa0mm); some coastal areas did not receive any precipitation from the storm{48] rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the atlanta metropolitan area leaving some roads impassable or closed{49] the combination of moist air from the south cool temperatures from a cold front to the north and low pressures led to the development of supercells throughout georgia and south carolina several of which produced tornadoes{14] an f1 tornado touched down 3 miles (48xc2xa0km) north-northeast of pennington; first it passed through a farm causing severe damage to two dairy sheds a john deere tractor and three metal storage buildings the tornado destroyed a hay barn a carport and a car inside the carport as well while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow{50] the tornado passed through a forested area where it toppled or sheared off hundreds of trees as it entered a more urban area it downed

dollar general store while several houses were damaged from fallen trees{55] an f1 tornado also touched down near smoaks which uprooted several trees resulted in a crush car due to a fallen tree caused severe roof damage to a mobile home and killed one dog{56] the storm produced heavy rainfall in the northern portion of the state with some locations reporting over 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm){38] the rainfall resulted in flash flooding in areas which caused some damage{57]in north carolina the remnants of the storm dropped around 5 inches (130xc2xa0mm) in the east-central part of the state while the southwestern portion of the state received totals of over 7 inches (180xc2xa0mm){38] in raleigh a boy drowned from the floodwaters{4] the tornado outbreak from the storm extended into north
