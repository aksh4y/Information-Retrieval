(pronounced xcbx88axc9xaak) was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the greater antilles and northern america in septemberxc2xa02008 wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture particularly in cuba and texas other locations were also seriously affected by ike which was ultimately the fourth-costliest of any atlantic hurricane and resulted in 375 billion in

intensity as a categoryxc2xa04xc2xa0hurricane over the open waters of the central atlantic on septemberxc2xa04 as it tracked westward several fluctuations in strength occurred before ike made landfall on eastern cuba on septemberxc2xa08 the hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the gulf of mexico but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall on galveston texas on septemberxc2xa013 the remnants of ike continued to track across the united states and into canada causing considerable damage inland before dissipating two days laterike was blamed for at least 195 deaths of these deaths 74 were in haiti which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms (fay gustav and hanna) which had made landfall that same year seven people were killed in cuba by ike{1] in the united states 113 people were reported killed directly or indirectly and 16 were still missing as of august 2011{2] due to its immense size ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county region near corpus christi texas{3] in addition ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida panhandle{4] damages from ike in us coastal and inland areas are estimated at 295xc2xa0billion (2008xc2xa0usd){2] with additional damage of 73xc2xa0billion in cuba (the costliest storm ever in that country) 200 million in the bahamas and 500xc2xa0million in the turks and caicos amounting to a total of at least 375xc2xa0billion in damage ike is currently the third-costliest atlantic hurricane of all time only surpassed by hurricane katrina in 2005 and later by hurricane sandy in 2012{5] though initial cost estimates for hurricanes harvey{6]{7] and irma{8]{9]{10]{11]{12]{13] indicate both will surpass ike the search-and-rescue operation after ike is the largest search-and-rescue operation in texas history{14]ike was the third major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season{2]contents1

storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe origins of hurricane ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave first identified by the national hurricane centerxc2xa0(nhc) just within the western coast of africa on augustxc2xa028{15]{16] despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the cape verde islands{17] the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity the broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa01 by this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles (1260 kilometers) west of cape verde although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12:00xc2xa0utc that day{18] operationally the nhc began issuing advisories on ike three hours later by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow{19] over the next few hours ike developed additional rainbands{20] but failed to a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm's south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures{21] these factors were also responsible for ike's slow developmental trend that began after formation{18]meteorological prediction of ike's path on september 3 2008ike's gradual strengthening began to quicken early on septemberxc2xa03 with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm at roughly 15:00xc2xa0utc that day microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm{18] tracking northwestward the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at 18:00xc2xa0utc based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery{18]{22] during this time ike was centered 690xc2xa0mi (1110xc2xa0km) east-northeast of the leeward islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast{18] ike's placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north{22] reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane{23] at 06:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa04 ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars (276 inches of mercury) making the storm a categoryxc2xa04 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale after peaking in strength a ridge of high pressure to the storm's west strengthened causing ike to track towards the southwestxe2x80x94a path unusual for the time of year however this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear{18] causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on septemberxc2xa04 and weaken{24] briefly dropping below major hurricane status on septemberxc2xa06 while 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) east of grand turk island{25] although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days after passing near the turks and caicos islands ike made its first landfall on inagua in the bahamas at 13:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa07 with winds of 125xc2xa0mph (201xc2xa0kmh){26]after passing over inagua{26] the development of a double eyewallxe2x80x94a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cyclexe2x80x94slightly weakened ike late on septemberxc2xa07{27] however the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach categoryxc2xa04 intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of holguxc3xadn province in cuba by 00:00xc2xa0utc the next day{26] although ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern cuba{28] the hurricane's core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the caribbean sea after spending a few hours over land{29] over the next day ike tracked westward paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification; at times the center of the hurricane was within 12xc2xa0mi (19xc2xa0km) of the island at around 14:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa09 ike made a second cuban landfall this time on punta la capitana in pinar del rio with winds of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) roughly six hours later the hurricane emerged into the gulf of mexico as a slightly weakened system{26]despite tracking back over water ike's prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the system's core and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing the storm's wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued{26] due to the storm's comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands{30] an eyewall replacement cycle took place preventing ike from rapidly intensifying at around the same time a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricane's north steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated moving over the warm waters of the loop current{26] ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00xc2xa0utc with an estimate of 944xc2xa0mbar (279xc2xa0inhg); though winds would continue to strengthen afterward the storm's pressure would rise{31] by late on septemberxc2xa012 ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds{26] and at 0700xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa013 ike made landfall on the northeast end of galveston island in texas with a minimum barometric pressure of 950xc2xa0mbar (28xc2xa0inhg) and sustained winds of 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) making ike a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane{31] after tracking inland ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward weakening to tropical storm status east of palestine texas late on septemberxc2xa013 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on septemberxc2xa014 over the ozarks{26] a more steady weakening phase ensued and after tracking across southern ontario and quebec the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the st lawrence river on septemberxc2xa015{32]preparations{edit]turks and caicos and the bahamas{edit]fearing a repeat of hurricane donna in 1960 the overseas branch of the british red cross began preparing contingency plans for 2000xc2xa0families considered to be at risk from ike a group of 260xc2xa0chinese construction workers stuck on middle caicos after the passage of hurricane hanna were evacuated by the british red cross{33] immediately before the storm struck 348xc2xa0people on grand turk were put into emergency shelters{34]florida{edit]a florida army national guardsman uses a single mobile user case set to send a situation report on ongoing preparations for hurricane ike in key west floridaon september 5 florida governor charlie crist declared a state of emergency in advance of ike's arrival (which was expected to be as early as september 8) authorities in key west issued a mandatory evacuation for all visitors for september 6 the federal emergency management agency (fema) positioned supplies and emergency response crews in florida and along the gulf coastflorida keys officials began evacuations on the low-lying chain of islands in phases starting at the end in key west by 8xc2xa0am sunday and continuing throughout the dayxe2x80x94at noon for the middle keys and at 4xc2xa0pm for the upper keys including key largo visitors were told to leave on saturday{35] overall 15000 tourists evacuated but the storm stayed to the south only causing minor beach erosion{2]texas{edit]a us-air force staff sergeant receives a hug from a resident after hurricane ike september 13 2008on september 7 the texas waterwastewater agency response network (txwarn){36] activated its 700-member utility mutual aid network and began coordination with the state emergency operations center and the texas commission on environmental quality (tceq) to begin preparations and notifications to utilities to prepare for ike{37] state rural water associations activated mutual aid networks to prepare for the landfall of ike while still providing assistance to areas affected by hurricane gustav{38]{39] the texas rural water association held meetings with state agencies on september 9 to plan for landfall along the texas gulf coast{40]{41]on september 11 forecasting models began to show ike making landfall just south of galveston city manager steven leblanc late wednesday issued a mandatory evacuation order for the low-lying west end of galveston island{42] later the mandatory evacuation order was extended to the entire island of galveston as well as low-lying areas around houston texas{43] mandatory evacuations were also ordered for jefferson orange and chambers counties located east of houston voluntary evacuations were in effect for hardin and tyler as well as newton and jasper counties{44] residents evacuating ahead of ike were received by emergency workers in the dallasfort worth(dfw) metroplex where they were provided a place of refuge medical treatment and provisions in addition to the orders of local and state officials federal officials were thoroughly involved in evacuation decisions on september 10 us president george w bush made an emergency declaration for texas making more federal help available for preparations and evacuations{45] more than one million people evacuated in advance of hurricane ike but more than 100000 people did not{46]at 8:19xc2xa0pm (cdt) september 11 the national weather service in houstongalveston texas issued a strongly worded bulletin regarding storm surge along the shoreline of galveston bay the bulletin advised that residents living in single-family homes in some parts of coastal texas faced "certain death" if they did not heed orders to evacuate{47]{48]{49] reports said as many as 40 percent of galveston's citizens did not pay attention to the warnings{50] it was feared to be much the same in port arthur and it was predicted that low-lying areas between morgan city louisiana and baffin bay texas particularly those areas east of ike's projected eye landfall would experience the greatest damage from storm surges of up to 20 feet (61xc2xa0m){51]the price of gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the south texas coast or at least delays in production from the oil and gas platforms in the gulf of mexico{52] 14 oil refineries shut down production and nearly 150 oil tankers and cargo ships waited off-shore as every port from lake charles louisiana to corpus christi texas shut down in preparation for the storm{2]impact{edit]fatalities

total loss{2]{34]{54] there was also significant structural damage to roofs and buildings containing health services resulting in the disruption of most health services{34] the local pharmacy roof collapsed destroying the area's prescription drug supply the police station and the prison was significantly damaged and local supplies facilities were either damaged or destroyed{34] water and electricity were also disrupted but since have been restoredmeanwhile in south caicos 95 of the houses were also damaged with over one-third significantly damaged or destroyed{2] a two-year-old cruise ship terminal in south caicos owned by carnival cruise lines was significantly damaged{2] damage also occurred on other islands mostly agricultural or the fishing industry but in general the damage was minor{2]buildings on the islands have been severely weakened and 750xc2xa0people have lost their homes{55] due to the extent and magnitude of damage and affected population the government of the turks and caicos declared grand turk and south caicos islands disaster areasin great inagua island the bahamas eighty percent of houses sustained damage with almost a third of them having significant damage the local morton salt factory was damaged and shut down operations{2] a few outlining islands suffered minor damage and no casualties was reported overall damage from the turks and caicos and the bahamas was estimated between 50 million and 200 million{2]haiti{edit]the remains of a school in port-au-prince haiti on september 15 2008the outer bands of ike caused additional flooding in haiti which was already devastated by hanna and also hit hard by fay and gustav the last bridge still standing into the city of gonaxc3xafves was washed away slowing relief in the community considerably and creating a deep humanitarian and food crisis in the hard-hit region{2]{56] 74 deaths were reported in haiti from ike most of which were in the coastal community of cabaret which was swept away by floodwaters and mudslides{2]{57] haitian prime minister michxc3xa8le pierre-louis called for help at the end of the week saying that four storms in three weeks have left over 550 dead and as many as one million homeless{58] she also said that parts of gonaxc3xafves were so severely damaged that the city may have to be rebuilt elsewhere{58] two additional deaths were reported in the dominican

40xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) in different areas of cuba the categoryxc2xa04 hurricane made landfall on september 8 on the north coast of eastern cuba in the province of holguxc3xadn near puerto de sama with sustained winds of about 130xc2xa0mph (209xc2xa0kmh){2] causing widespread flooding and damage to the eastern provinces{2] it passed across the central provinces of holguxc3xadn las tunas and camagxc3xbcey emerging over the sea to the south of cuba during the day ike dropped to category one intensity by the time it crossed the island{67] it then followed the southern coast of cuba and crossed the western end of the island in pinar del rxc3xado province close to the path taken by hurricane gustav ten days previously the western areas of cuba already devastated by just 10xc2xa0days before ike hit suffered additional major flooding from the rain and storm surge{1] the sugar cane crop was devastated with over 3400 square kilometres (1300xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi) destroyed the banana yucca coffee and corn crop also suffered significant damage{2] alongside gustav they were described as the "worst ever" storms by cuban officials{68]in total seven people were killed in cuba from ike due to drowning or collapsing structures{1]{2] over 300000 houses were damaged with an estimated 43000 a total loss{2] the combined damage estimate from ike and gustav and succeeding paloma is about

national hurricane center{70]{71]{72]{nb 2]due to the intensity of the storm texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries because much of the united states oil refining capacity is located in texas the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline home heating oil and natural gas{73] increases were particularly high in north carolina especially in the mountains where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average{74] the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav and the time required to restart production also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the carolinas and tennessee partly as a result of panic buying{75] 113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the us including 85 in texas (18 direct) eight in louisiana one in arkansas two in tennessee one in kentucky seven in indiana four in missouri two in illinois two in michigan seven in ohio and one in pennsylvania{2] as of august 2011 16

motorcycle grand prix held in indianapolis stopping both 125cc and motogp races after the two-thirds of the distance and causing the cancellation of the 250cc race in arkansas about 200000 customers lost power as a result of the winds the worst power loss in that state since an ice storm in 2000{105] in the louisville area over 300000 customers were without powerxc2xa0xe2x80x94 the worst power outage in the utility's history{100] the cincinnati metropolitan area was hard hit as well with over 927000 customers losing power in that region a duke energy spokesperson said "we have never seen anything like this never wexe2x80x99re talking about 90 percent of our customers without power" there were so many power outages and so few workers available duke energy was thinking of sending workers from their base in charlotte north carolina{106] many homes and business were without power for 3xe2x80x937 days in the dayton ohio area 300000 of 515000 dayton power  light co customers lost power at some point following severe wind storms on the afternoon of september 14 according to a company spokesperson{107] also hard hit were central ohio (with over 350000 customers losing power) and northeastern ohio (with over 310000 customers losing power){108] as well as illinois (49000){109] missouri (85000){110] and western pennsylvania (with over 180000 customers losing power){111] in western kentucky outside crews had to be brought in from as far away as mississippi to restore power{112] in indiana about 350000 customers lost power statewide mainly in the southern part of the state{113] in new york state over 100000 customers were reported without power{114] in total 28 deaths have been blamed on ike in the inland states{2]canada{edit]main article: effects of hurricane ike in inland north americaaccumulations in canadain ontario ike's remnants brought a record amount of rain on sunday september 14 in the windsor region it was closely following a slow-moving frontal system that had drenched the city the day before dumping 752 millimeters (296 inches) of rain and breaking the old record of 391xc2xa0mm (154xc2xa0in) in 1979 according to environment canada most damage in the windsor area with ike was confined to downed power lines and toppled tree branches with the wind gusts reaching 80xc2xa0kmh (50xc2xa0mph) with spotty street flooding that made driving completely treacherous in some areas{115] highways were washed out in the bruce peninsula and trees were uprooted in london ontario the storm continued to cause wind and rain damage as it continues east along the st lawrence river leaving around 25000 customers without electricity especially in belleville brockville bancroft peterborough bowmanville huntsville and timmins{116]in quebec regions to the north of the saint lawrence river received 50xc2xa0mm (20xc2xa0in) to 70xc2xa0mm (28xc2xa0in) of rainfall (hautes-laurentides haute-mauricie rxc3xa9serve faunique des laurentides saguenay-lac-saint-jean charlevoix and cxc3xb4te-nord) maximum rainfall was recorded between lac-st-jean and the rxc3xa9serve faunique des laurentides with a station recording more than 90xc2xa0mm (35xc2xa0in) of rain{117] along the river the amount were more in the 10xc2xa0mm (04xc2xa0in) and 30xc2xa0mm (12xc2xa0in) range except in quebec city area which received almost 50xc2xa0mm (20xc2xa0in) most of it between 7:00xc2xa0pm and 8:00xc2xa0pm{117] this rain caused small inundations storm drain overflows and closed one major highway{118] in montreal high humidity levels pushed by the system caused electrical malfunction one of the lines of the subway stranding over 25000 commuters{119] high winds up to 78xc2xa0kmh (48xc2xa0mph) caused at their worst over 25000 households to lose electricity in montreal laval estrie and montxc3xa9rxc3xa9gie{120] and when it reached the magdalen islands it had enough strength to cause a sailboat the ocxc3xa9an to sink its six passengers were rescued by a helicopter of the canadian coast guard{117]{120]the "ike spike" in gasoline prices was quite severe in canada with gas prices rising anywhere from 15 to 20 cents per liter{121]iceland{edit]ike's remnants combined with an unusual depression that affected southwestern iceland on september 17 three days after ike became extratropical{122] the storm produced 9xc2xa0m (30xc2xa0ft) waves along southwest coasts of the island rainfall peaked near 200xc2xa0mm (79xc2xa0in) close to reykjavxc3xadk wind gusts were measured up to 89xc2xa0mph (143xc2xa0kmh){123] strong winds on the backside of the system produced a large dust storm in northern areas of the island{124]aftermath{edit]turks and caicos and the bahamas{edit]due to the damage brought by ike in the turks and caicos islands the insular government declared the islands of grand turk and south caicos as disaster areas damage on the islands was surveyed immediately following the hurricane's passage by a cdera assessment team from jamaica following the occurrence of extensive power outages the caribbean electric utilities services cooperation offered to support the restoration of power services the british hms iron duke (f234) was sent to the islands to assist in recovery efforts and personnel from the british red cross were also dispatched{125]criticism of aid{edit]after hurricane ike many residents applied to fema for loans and fema trailers many residents were forced to wait several weeks until their trailers arrived some waited for up to two months living in hotels in homes of relatives several miles away or in their homes with no power or running water many residents were angry at the response that fema gave to the problem texas state leaders also accused fema of foot dragging and insensitivity{126]31 billion in federal aid was eventually allocated to texas by the department of housing and urban development it was supposed to be used to repair single-family homes of lower and middle-class income families but as of 2011 only 10 of those funds were released while the rest were held up because of "state bureaucracy"{127]public and mental health issues{edit]hurricane ike also brought many health issues to the victims damages from the homes and the environment helped create these issues amongst the public following the disaster communities were challenged to provide the correct medical treatment in emergency rooms and other medical facilities it developed stress restricting victims their basic health services orange county had an 885 percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity by late october five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients{128]the need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder most individuals will not progress in constant behavioral or mental health problems but the world health organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term issues{128] telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of hurricane ike post disaster mental health occurrences were 59 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder 45 percent for major depressive episode and 99 percent for general anxiety disorder{129] a galveston bay recovery study (gbrs) was a survey distributed through a random stratified cluster sampling of victims in the galveston bay area for research on traumatic stress and disaster exposure when surveyed victims were asked how they felt and what they experienced after the hurricane there was an immediate emotional response of fear from the loss of property employment displacement and damages{130] children were targeted for physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and employment{128] results of post-traumatic stress disorder depressive symptoms anxiety symptoms dysfunctions and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since hurricane ike{130] there was an increase of impairments interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly smoking more and restlessness{130] development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing electricity food money transportation or water for at least one weekvictims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community an exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases air contamination smoke inhalation and lead poisoning as disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards developing a risk of injury{128] after the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning eighty-two percent to 87 percent of carbon monoxide were caused by the improper use of generators the texas department of state health services issued that gasoline generators should not be used indoor{131] fifty-four people were reported by the texas poison centers to have storm related carbon monoxide exposure the undersea and hyperbaric medical society and the center for disease control reported 15 people had to undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning{131]{132] symptoms from exposure were headaches nausea and vomiting with the majority of the treated cases under the age of eighteen{132]{133]sports{edit]hurricane ike forced the houston astros and the chicago cubs to play out their 3-game set in milwaukee at miller park{134] ike also forced the postponement of the second-week nfl game between the houston texans and the baltimore ravens the game was later made up in houston after repairs were made to reliant stadium on november 9 2008 it also forced the ncaa football game on september 13 between the houston cougars and the air force falcons to be moved from robertson stadium in houston to gerald ford stadium in dallas{135] ike also forced the postponement of a texas longhorns game in austin{136] texas due to increased evacuee traffic in the city's shelters tickets for world wrestling entertainment (wwe) wrestlemania xxv were originally scheduled to go on sale september 20 2008 but it was postponed due to the effect of ike on the state of texas until november 8 2008{137]{138]relief efforts{edit]there were a number of relief efforts set up to help those caught up in ike including one set up by portlight and weather underground most of them raised at least 10000 to help out{139] the portlightweather underground effort created some initial controversy springing from the unexpected overwhelming response to requests for assistanceportlight delivered over 500000 worth of equipment to people with disabilities and outlying communities that were impacted by hurricane ike they also delivered pizza to the residents of the hard-hit bolivar peninsula and helped provide a christmas party for residents of bridge city texas{140]{141]oil and gas spills{edit]hurricane ike's winds surge and giant waves tossed storage tanks and punctured pipelines however operators in the gulf of mexico (ranging from major integrated producers like bp and shell to small privately owned independents) shut in operations in advance of ike's approach as a precautionary measure as a result of these shut-ins us oil production dropped from 5 million barrels per day (790000 cubic meters per day) to 4xc2xa0mbbld (640000xc2xa0m3d) in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane by late november production was restored to pre-ike levels despite the hurricane only 500000 us gallons (1900 cubic meters) of crude oil spilled into the gulf of mexico and the marshes bayous and bays of louisiana and texas over a coastline distance of 185 miles (298 kilometres) much of the spillage occurred in the high island area of galveston county texas where storm surge rose over a low-lying oilfield and flooded the marshy area around several producing wells beam pumps and storage tanks during the days both before and after the storm companies and residents reported around 448 releases of gas oil and other substances into the environment in louisiana and texas the hardest hit places were industrial centers near houston and port arthur texas as well as oil production facilities off louisiana's coast{142]the coast guard with the environmental protection agency and state agencies has responded to more than 3000 pollution reports associated with the storm and its surge along the upper texas coast most callers complain about abandoned propane tanks paint cans and other hazardous materials containers turning up in marshes backyards and other places{143]collision of oil tanker with drilling rig{edit]on march 6 2009 a 159000-ton norwegian tanker sks satilla collided with jackup drilling rig ensco 74 operated by ensco plc which had been missing after ike struck{144] the tanker's double hull prevented an oil spill at the site 65 miles south of galveston which is 115 miles west of the original position of the rig{145] four drilling rigs including ensco 74 were damaged by ike but ensco 74 was the only missing rig at least 52 oil platforms were damaged by ike{146]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesbecause of the tremendous damage number of deaths and people left missing the name ike was officially retired on april 22 2009 by the world meteorological organization and will never be used again for an atlantic tropical cyclone it was replaced with isaias in the 2014 season{147] isaias however was not used in 2014 so it could be used in 2020{148]future mitigation{edit]see also: ike dikea commission was established by rick perry the texas governor following the hurricane to investigate preparing for and mitigating future disasters a proposal has been put forth to build an "ike dike" a massive levee system which would protect the galveston bay and the important industrial facilities which line the coast and the ship channel from a future potentially more destructive storm the proposal has gained widespread support from a variety of business interests as of 2009{update] it is currently only at the conceptual stage{149]see also{edit]houston portaltropical cyclones
