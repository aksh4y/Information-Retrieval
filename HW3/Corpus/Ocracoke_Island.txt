occasionally visited by algonquian-speaking native americans but was never permanently settled ocracoke then called wokokkon{9] was used as a subsistence hunting and fishing ground for the hatterask indians yaupon tea or black drink made from the dried leaves of the indigenous yaupon a native holly was used ceremonially by the native americans in the area a small village on hatteras island is said{when?] to have had forty fighting men the area was first described in detail by giovanni da verrazzano an italian navigator in 1524 verrazzano was unable to navigate the tortuous channels leading into the pamlico sound and assumed that china lay beyond the outer banks{10]{11]howard streetin 1585 sir walter raleigh's colony in their ship the tiger in search of roanoke island collided with a sand bar in ocracoke inlet and were forced to land on the island for repairs{12]an attempt at an english settlement was tried at roanoke island in the late 16th century but it failed this effectively halted european settlement until 1663 when carolina colony was chartered by king charles ii however remote ocracoke island was not permanently settled until 1750 being a pirate haven at times before then it was a favorite anchorage of edward teach better known as the pirate blackbeard he was killed in a fierce battle with troops from virginia on november 22 1718{13] the grounds of what is now the springer's point nature preserve were said to be the pirate's favored hang-out during those days{14]sand dunesthroughout the mid-to-late 18th century the island was home to a number of especially skilled schooner pilots who could get smaller ships through the inlet to the pamlico sound as population increased on the mainland demand for transshipment of goods from ocean-going vessels increased the population was listed as 139 in the 1800 census warehouses were built to hold goods off-loaded from larger ships offshore and then loaded onto smaller schooners to be delivered to plantations and towns along the mainland rivers{15]by the late 19th century the shipping business was gone and the united states lifesaving service became a major source of steady income for local men{16] fishing including charters for tourists became more important to the livelihood of the area{17]the ocracoke historic district ocracoke light station and salter-battle hunting and fishing lodge are listed on the national register of historic places{18]in august and september 1933 and again in september 1944 and august 1949 major hurricanes struck the island interestingly the first person accounts of these storms were recorded on the walls of the "hurricane house"{19]fort ocracoke{edit]fort ocracokefort ocracoke a confederate fortification constructed at the beginning of the american civil war was situated on beacon island in ocracoke inlet two miles to the west-southwest of ocracoke village the octagonally shaped fort was built on a previous war of 1812 site at one point nearly 500 confederate troops were stationed in and around ocracoke and the fort the confederates abandoned and partially destroyed the fort in august 1861 after union victories on nearby hatteras island union forces razed it a month later on september 17 1861 beacon island and the fort subsided beneath the waves of the inlet after the 1933 hurricanes that struck the area{20] the remnants of fort ocracoke were relocated and identified in 1998 by the surface interval diving company{21]geography{edit]ocracoke islandthe island of ocracoke is a part of the outer banks of north carolina it is one of the most remote islands in the outer banks as it can only be reached by one of three public ferries (two of which are toll ferries) private boat or private plane other than the village of ocracoke and a few other areas (a ferry terminal a pony pen a small runway) the entire island is part of the cape hatteras national seashore{22]{23]view of ocracoke lighthouse across silver lakethe village of ocracoke is located around a small sheltered harbor called silver lake with a second smaller residential area built around a series of man-made canals called oyster creek the village is located at the widest point of the island protected from the atlantic ocean by sand dunes and a salt marsh the average height of the island is less than five feet above sea level and many of the buildings on the island are built on pilings to lift them off the ground flooding is a risk during both hurricanes and large storms ocracoke lighthouse is situated near silver lake and has remained in continuous operation since 1823{24]british cemeterythe island is also home to a british cemetery during world war ii german submarines sank several british ships including the hmt bedfordshire and the bodies of british sailors were washed ashore{25] they were buried in a cemetery on the island a lease for the 2290-square-foot (213xc2xa0m2) plot where a british flag flies at all times was given to the commonwealth war graves commission for as long as the land remained a cemetery and the small site officially became a british cemetery the united states coast guard station on ocracoke island takes care of the property{26] a memorial ceremony is held each year in may{27]ocracoke village is located at 35xc2xb06xe2x80xb246xe2x80xb3n 75xc2xb058xe2x80xb233xe2x80xb3wxefxbbxbf  xefxbbxbf3511278xc2xb0n 7597583xc2xb0wxefxbbxbf
