therefore global data must be acquired quality controlled and archived working with international institutions such as the international council of scientific unions the world data centers and the world meteorological organization ncdc develops standards by which data can be exchanged and made accessiblencdc provides the historical perspective on climate through the use of over a hundred years of weather observations reference data bases are generated from this knowledge the clientele of ncdc can learn from the past to prepare for a better tomorrow wise use of our most valuable natural resource climate is the goal of climate researchers state and regional climate centers business and commerce{6]associated entities{edit]ncdc also maintained world data center for meteorology asheville the four world centers (us russia japan and china) have created a free and open situation in which data and dialogue are exchangedncdc maintained the us climate reference network datasets amongst a vast number of other climate monitoring products{7]see also{edit]climate prediction centerenvironmental data rescuenational severe storms laboratorystate of the climatestorm prediction centerreferences{edit]^ osborne susan;
