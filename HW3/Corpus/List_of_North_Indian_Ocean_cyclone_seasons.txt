bengal located in the northeast of the indian ocean is responsible for the formation of some of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones in the world the basin is abbreviated bob by the india meteorological department (imd) the official regional specialized meteorological center of the basin the bay of bengal's coast is shared among india bangladesh myanmar sri lanka and western part of thailand the strongest storm in the bay was the 1999 odisha cyclone as the remnants impact tibet and yunnan sometimes the national meteorological center of cma also issues full advisories to cyclonic storms in this basin{1]the arabian sea is a sea located in the northwest of the indian ocean tropical cyclones in the basin are abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department (imd) the official regional specialized meteorological centre (rsmc) of the basin the arabian sea's coast is shared among india yemen oman iran pakistan sri lanka maldives and somalia{2] monsoons are characteristic of the arabian sea and responsible for the yearly cycling of its waters in summer strong winds blow from the southwest to the northeast bringing rain to the indian subcontinent during the winter the winds are milder and blow in the opposite direction from the northeast to the southwest{2] cyclones are rare in the arabian sea but the basin can produce strong tropical cyclones super cyclonic storm gonu was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the basin{3]{4] {5] however storms typically do not reach a high intensity in the arabian sea due to the small amount of water dry air coming from the desert of the arabian peninsula and unfavorable wind shear from the monsoon{6]history of the basin{edit]the systematic scientific studies of tropical systems in the bay of bengal and arabian sea was started during the 19th century by henry piddington{7] piddington utilised meteorological logs of vessels that navigated the seas and published a series of memoirs in the xe2x80x9cjournal of the asiatic society of bengalxe2x80x9d between 1839 and 1858{7] these memoirs gave accounts and tracks of individual storms in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea{7]during the 2004 post monsoon season the imd started to name tropical cyclones within the basin with the first one named cyclone onil during september 2004{8]during 2015 a modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd and wmo calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90 knots (165xc2xa0kmh; 105xc2xa0mph) and 120 knots (220xc2xa0kmh; 140xc2xa0mph) an extremely severe cyclonic storm{9]water temperatures in the arabian sea are typically warm enough to allow for tropical cyclogenesis year round although strong wind shear from the monsoon trough prevents formation in the summer months and limits intensity other times of the year an increase in air pollution since the 1930s caused a decrease in the wind shear allowing storms to have become stronger since 1979{10]years{edit]periodseasons1900spre-1980 1970 1980-1984 1985-1988 198990s1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 19992000s2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 20092010s2010 2011 2012
