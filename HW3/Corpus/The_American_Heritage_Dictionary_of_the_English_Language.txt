the completed ballots are returned and tabulated and the results form the basis for special usage notes appended to the relevant dictionary entries in many cases these notes not only report the percentage of panelists who consider a given usage or construction to be acceptable but will also report the results from balloting of the same question in past decades to give a clearer sense of how the language changes over timeillustrations{edit]the ahd is also somewhat innovative in its liberal use of photographic illustrations which at the time was highly unusual for general reference dictionaries many of which went largely or completely unillustrated it also has an unusually large number of biographical entries for notable personsfirst edition{edit]the first edition appeared in 1969 highly praised for its indo-european etymologies in addition to the normally expected etymologies which for instance trace the word ambiguous to a proto-indo-european root ag- meaning "to drive" the appendices included a seven-page article by professor calvert watkins entitled "indo-european and the indo-europeans" and "indo-european roots" 46 pages of entries that are each organized around one of some thousand proto-indo-european roots and the english words of the ahd that are understood to have evolved from them these entries might be called "reverse etymologies": the ag- entry there for instance lists 49 terms derived from it words as diverse as agent essay purge stratagem ambassador axiom and pellagra along with information about varying routes through intermediate transformations on the way to the contemporary wordsa compacted american heritage college dictionary was first released in 1974second and later editions{edit]the first edition's concise successor the american heritage dictionary second college edition was published in 1982 (without a larger-format version) it omitted the indo-european etymologies but they were reintroduced in the third full edition published in 1992 the third edition was also a departure for the publisher because it was developed in a database which facilitated the use of the linguistic data for other applications such as electronic dictionariesthe fourth edition (2000 reissued in 2006) added an appendix of semitic language etymological roots and included color illustrations and was also available with a cd-rom edition in some versions this revision was larger than a typical desk dictionary but smaller than webster's third new international dictionary or the unabridged random house dictionary of the english language a lower-priced college edition also the fourth was issued in black-and-white printing and with fewer illustrations in 2002 (reprinted in 2007 and 2010)the fifth and most recent full edition was published in november 2011{3] with new printings in 2012 and 2016 it is available in hardcover and with reduced print size and smaller page count trade paperback form it dropped several of the supplementary features of the fourth edition and is not available with a disc-based electronic version the university-student version was rebranded the american heritage college writer's dictionary in 2013 and stripped of biographical and geographical entries to make room for more vocabulary while simultaneously reducing the number of pages compared to the fourth college editionthe ahd inserts minor revisions (such as a biographical entry with photograph for each newly elected us president) in successive printings of any given editionsupporting volumes have been issued including the american heritage book of english usage the american heritage dictionary of indo-european roots the american heritage abbreviations dictionary the american heritage dictionary of idioms the american heritage thesaurus in various sizes;
