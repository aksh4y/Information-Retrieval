cayman islands honduras belize mexico texaspart of the 2005 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane emily was the earliest forming category 5 atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the most intense to form before august a powerful early season and cape verde-type tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across the caribbean sea to mexico the storm formed on julyxc2xa010 2005 in the central atlantic ocean before passing through the windward islands on julyxc2xa014 tracking generally towards the west-northwest the storm gradually intensified as it traversed the caribbean peaking as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane on julyxc2xa016 marking the earliest date for a storm to do so during the course of a given year the system subsequently made landfall in the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula as a categoryxc2xa04 quickly crossing the peninsula emily emerged into the gulf of mexico and reorganized on julyxc2xa020 the storm struck tamaulipas as a major hurricane and rapidly dissipated within

according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon july 6 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa moving westward the disturbance gradually organized until julyxc2xa010 at which point convection became more concentrated and it is estimated tropical depression five formed in the central tropical atlantic that evening{1] late on julyxc2xa011 it strengthened and was named tropical storm emily initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the greater antilles emily instead moved almost due west toward the windward islands remaining a moderate tropical storm the storm languished while moving quickly west and struggled with maintaining its form contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind hurricane dennis had made portions of the caribbean sea warmer{2] and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development late on julyxc2xa013 emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing tobago and entering the eastern caribbean on julyxc2xa014 emily made landfall in northern grenada with 90xc2xa0mph (145xc2xa0kmh) winds{1]the intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern caribbean sea a region typically unfavorable for intensification hurricane emily's winds increased in reaction briefly bringing the storm to category 4 strength early on julyxc2xa015 during the day the storm's strength fluctuated greatly dropping to a categoryxc2xa02 storm and then rebuilding to categoryxc2xa04 on julyxc2xa016 emily strengthened considerably making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of july with peak winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh) the earliest known category 5 in the atlantic basin initially at this point emily was thought to have peaked as a categoryxc2xa04 storm but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane{1] the storm weakened slightly as it continued westward and remained a categoryxc2xa04 while passing south of jamaica and on julyxc2xa017 the cayman islands hurricane emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest weakening somewhat but remaining at categoryxc2xa04 until striking cozumel just before mainland landfall at playa del carmen at 06:30xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa018 sustained winds were 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) and the eyewall passed directly over cozumelhurricane emily making landfall on julyxc2xa018 2005the center of circulation emerged over the gulf of mexico later that morning{1] passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75xc2xa0mph (120xc2xa0kmh) however several hours over the warm waters of the western gulf provided the energy needed for emily to regenerate and by midnight wind speeds were increasing the increase in wind speed stalled but the storm continued to become better organized emily started to show very symmetrical outflow but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center however the outer wind radii subsided in the end and the inner core prevailed the result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of julyxc2xa019 the pressure dropped about 30xc2xa0millibars and the winds went from 90xc2xa0mph (145xc2xa0kmh) to more than 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) all within a few hours{1]further strengthening was expected by forecasters but did not come{1] the storm's motion slowed and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast the storm made landfall around 11:00xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa020 near san fernando in tamaulipas the storm had sustained winds of 125xc2xa0mph (200xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa03 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after heading inland over northeast mexico it dissipated over the sierra madre oriental on julyxc2xa021{1]preparations{edit]hurricane emily as seen by the us national weather service's nexrad in brownsville texas at 03:07xc2xa0utc julyxc2xa020 the storm's eye is clearly visible surrounded by the strong storms of the eyewall at imaging time emily was a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane with 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0km) winds was moving west-northwest at 7xc2xa0mph (11xc2xa0kmh) and was roughly 100xc2xa0miles (160xc2xa0km) away from the location of landfallin mexico tens of thousands of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around cancxc3xban the riviera maya and cozumel{3] hotel guests were evacuated on saturday afternoon and staff on sunday afternoon though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas no alcohol was sold in cancun for 36xc2xa0hours prior to the arrival of the storm in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by pemex a german resident was electrocuted while on his roof in playa del carmen{4]impact{edit]caribbean{edit]on july 14 emily hit grenada which was still recovering from the impact of hurricane ivan less than a year earlier emily resulted in one reported fatality and significant damage in the northern part of the country including carriacou which had been spared the worst effects of ivan 16xc2xa0houses were destroyed and well over 200 more were damaged and two of the main hospitals were flooded{5] damages in grenada amounted to 1104xc2xa0million{6]landslides were reported in eastern jamaica triggered by heavy rain as the storm passed south of the island{5] five people were killed due to an accident caused by flash flooding{7] damages in jamaica were

from 135xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) winds; however these winds were confined to a small area around emily's center areas in playa del carmen tulum and cozumel sustained the most severe impact in a few instances concrete utility poles were snapped in half by powerful wind gusts due to the relatively fast movement of emily rainfall was fairly light peaking at 49xc2xa0in (120xc2xa0mm) few meteorological reports exist during emily's passage of the yucatxc3xa1n though an unofficial station recorded a storm surge of 15xc2xa0ft (46xc2xa0m) in san miguel cozumel{1] along the mainland surge heights were generally less than 4xc2xa0ft (1xc2xa0m) additionally waves reached 13xc2xa0ft (4xc2xa0m) resulting in some beach erosion and damage to dunes and coral reefs additionally 07xc2xa0mi (11xc2xa0km) of retaining walls sustained damage leaving areas vulnerable to flooding from future storms{17]the high winds produced by emily caused considerable impact in quintana roo especially in the municipality of solidaridad leaving nearly 200000 residences without power in terms of structural damage 851 homes were impacted in varying degrees roughly 13345xc2xa0acres (5400xc2xa0hectares) of forests and agricultural land was affected by the storm; some swathes of trees experienced defoliation the most substantial losses associated with the hurricane stemmed from the tourism industry with hotels experiencing 947xc2xa0million pesos (887xc2xa0million) worth of damage more than 12500 rooms nearly one-fifth of the state's available hotel infrastructure sustained damage overall damage in the state reached 111xc2xa0billion pesos (1043xc2xa0million){17]northeastern mexico{edit]emily's second landfall as a strong categoryxc2xa03 hurricane brought significant damage to the northeast coast of mexico in the fishing community of laguna madre over 80 of the buildings were destroyed as a result of the storm surge{1] several communities on the remote coast of tamaulipas were isolated after the storm and major coastal flooding was reported along with heavy wind damage with numerous homes destroyed inland flooding was also reported in monterrey{18]communication to the riviera maya area was difficult after the storm; not all cellular phones were receiving coverage to the area land lines were down and electricity was out about 18000xc2xa0people in 20 low-lying communities in the state of tamaulipas just south of the us-mexican border were evacuated including losses sustained by the oil industry damage in mexico amounted to 887xc2xa0billion pesos (8343xc2xa0million){14]texas{edit]total rainfall from emily in the united statesin southern texas damage was relatively minor despite the proximity of the storm{19] portions of the state experienced tropical storm force winds and gusts as high as 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) resulting in scattered roof damage along the coast a storm surge of 426xc2xa0ft (130xc2xa0m) flooded portions of texas state highway 100{1]{20] no significant structural damage was reported although some trees were down and over 30000 customers lost electricity{19] rainfall from the storm peaked at 52xc2xa0inches in mercedes texas additionally eight tornadoes touched down in texas as a result of emily damaging or destroying several homes some positive effects were noted; the remains of emily passed farther west into texas and delivered some badly needed rainfall helping relieve a drought{18] agricultural losses in texas amounted to 47xc2xa0million{16] while property losses reached 225000{15]see
