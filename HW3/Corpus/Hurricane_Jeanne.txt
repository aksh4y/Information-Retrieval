the islands of great abaco and grand bahama in the bahamas on september 25 jeanne made landfall later in the day in florida just 2xc2xa0miles (3xc2xa0kilometers) from where frances had struck a mere 3xc2xa0weeks earlier building on the rainfall of frances and ivan jeanne brought near-record flood levels as far north as west virginia and new jersey before its remnants turned east into the open atlantic jeanne is blamed for at least 3006 deaths in haiti with about 2800 in gonaxc3xafves alone which was nearly washed away by floods and mudslides the storm also caused 7 deaths in puerto rico 18 in the dominican republic and at least 4 in florida bringing the total number of deaths to at least 3025; jeanne is the 12th deadliest atlantic hurricane ever final property damage in the united

history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalemain article: meteorological history of hurricane jeannetropical depression eleven formed from a tropical wave 70xc2xa0miles (110xc2xa0km) east-southeast of guadeloupe in the evening of september 13{1] and was upgraded to tropical storm jeanne the next day{2] jeanne passed south of the us virgin islands on september 15{3] making landfall near yabucoa puerto rico later the same day{4] after crossing puerto rico jeanne reached hurricane strength on september 16 near the eastern tip of the dominican republic on the island of hispaniola{5] but fell back to tropical storm strength later that day as it moved across the mountainous island{6] jeanne moved offshore the dominican republic late in the afternoon of september 17{7] by that time jeanne had weakened to tropical depression strength{8] even though jeanne did not strike haiti directly the storm was large enough to cause flooding and mudslides particularly in the northwestern part of the country{9]hurricane jeanne image at time of landfall on the florida coaston september 18 while the system was being tracked near great inagua and haiti a new center formed well to the northeast and the previous circulation dissipated{10] the system restrengthened becoming a hurricane on september 20{11] jeanne continued to meander for several days (making a complete loop in the process) before beginning a steady westward motion toward the bahamas and florida{9]jeanne continued strengthening as it headed west passing over great abaco in the bahamas on the morning of september 25{12] shortly thereafter the hurricane reached category 3 strength{13] jeanne maintained this intensity as it passed grand bahama island at 11:50xc2xa0pm edt on september 25 (0350 utc september 26) jeanne made landfall on hutchinson island just east of sewall's point florida stuart florida and port saint lucie florida at categoryxc2xa03 strength{14] this is the same place hurricane frances struck florida three weeks earlier{9]{15]jeanne's track continued to follow within 20 miles (32xc2xa0km) of that of frances until it reached pasco county{16] the cyclone then swung more rapidly to the north and the center remained over land all the way to the georgia state line unlike frances which exited into the gulf of mexico jeanne became an extratropical cyclone over virginia on september 28 and the system moved back into the atlantic offshore the new jersey coast the next day{16]preparations{edit]puerto rico and the leeward islands{edit]on the afternoon of september 13 tropical storm watches were issued for the british virgin islands saba st eustatius and st maarten while tropical storm warnings were raised for puerto rico and the us virgin islands the watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings early on the morning of september 14 later in the morning tropical storm warnings were issued for st kitts and nevis while tropical storm watches were issued for anguilla during the afternoon tropical storm warnings were lowered for saba st eustatius and st maarten while hurricane warnings were issued for puerto rico and the us virgin islands late on the morning of september 15 a hurricane watch was issued for the british virgin islands that afternoon tropical storm warnings were dropped for st kitts and nevis while hurricane warnings were lowered to tropical storm warnings for the us virgin islands on the evening of september 15 tropical storm warnings were dropped puerto rico and the us virgin islands while hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings for puerto rico and all watches and warnings were dropped for the british virgin islands{9] the entire power grid of puerto rico was shut down by the government of sila maria calderxc3xb3n as the storm approached to prevent electrocutions and infrastructure damage{17]dominican republic and haiti{edit]hurricane jeanne making landfall on the east coast of hispaniola september 16tropical storm watches were issued from cabrera to isla saona early in the afternoon on september 14 later that afternoon hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were raised from cabrera to santo domingo late in the morning of september 15 hurricane warnings were issued from cabrera to isla saona while hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were raised from cabrera to puerto plata that evening hurricane warnings were extended westward from cabrera to puerto plata while hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued from puerto plata to monte cristi late in the morning of september 16 tropical storm warnings were issued from mxc3xb4le-saint-nicolas to puerto plata that afternoon hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings from puerto plata to isla saona while all hurricane watches were dropped late on the afternoon of september 17 tropical storm warnings were dropped for the remainder of hispaniola{9]bahamas{edit]in the bahamas the first hurricane watch was issued at 2100xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa015 and included acklins and crooked islands inagua mayaguana ragged island and turks and caicos islands by 1500xc2xa0utc the next day that hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning simultaneously another hurricane watch became in effect for cat island exuma long island rum cay and san salvador the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning at 2100xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa017 while the hurricane watch was lowered to a tropical storm watch both the tropical storm warning and tropical storm watch were discontinued at 1000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa019{9]although jeanne then tracked away from the bahamas the storm was threatening the archipelago again by septemberxc2xa023 as a result the tropical storm watch for cat island exumas long island rum cay and san salvador was resulted at 0900xc2xa0utc a hurricane watch was then issued for the northwestern bahamas by 1730xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa023 around 0900xc2xa0utc the next day a hurricane warning was posted for abaco islands andros islands berry islands bimini eleuthera grand bahama island and new providence while a tropical storm watch was simultaneously issued for cat island exumas long island rum cay and san salvador late on septemberxc2xa025 the tropical storm warning was canceled early on the following day the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning for abaco islands berry islands bimini and grand bahama island while the remaining portion xe2x80x93 andros islands eleuthera and new providence xe2x80x93 was discontinued all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were canceled by 0900xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa026{9]because hurricane frances struck only about two week prior numerous houses were still patched with plastic sheeting on their roofs while other residents were still living with neighbors or relatives officials urged residents in low-lying homes to evacuate shelters were set up at the churches and schools on abaco islands eleuthera grand bahama at least 700xc2xa0people went to a shelter in abaco islands alone{18]florida{edit]preparations in central florida were rushed and sudden as it did not become apparent that the storm would make a direct hit until the morning of the 23rd{19] indeed it had appeared the storm would pass safely offshore just the night before{20] voluntary evacuations were advised on thursday and friday plans for opening shelters on saturday were distributed to the public and florida power and light warned that power could be out "for an extended period of time"{21] canals were also drained on the same day{21]on friday the palm beach zoo prepared for the storm by moving small animals and birds into buildings such as restrooms and restaurants{22] evacuations began in earnest with many residents leaving for the keys noting that the islands were the only location definitely out of harm's way for once evacuation to the keys made sense{23]the center of jeanne's eye achieved landfall near stuart at virtually the identical spot that frances had come ashore three weeks earlier the first time in record keeping that a hurricane made landfall in the same place as a previous storm of the same season maximum winds at the time of landfall were estimated to be near 120 mph{24]impact{edit]deaths from hurricane jeannecountrytotalstatecountycountytotaldominican republic18haiti3006+puerto rico8united states5floridabrevard1clay1indian river1south

in vieux-habitants roads also suffered damage particularly in the beaugendre area leaving a dozen households isolated a primary school was impacted beyond repairs in saint-franxc3xa7ois a trench was dug along a major highway to prevent a residential subdivision from flooding{26]puerto rico{edit]main article: effects of hurricane jeanne in puerto ricopuerto rico was impacted by tropical storm force winds and heavy rain with flooding on a historic scale{24] the storm made landfall near maunabo midday on september 15{27] the storm generally moved northwest through the island exiting on the northwest coast near the town of mayagxc3xbcez around 11 pm{27] jeanne passed directly over the towns of arroyo patillas guayama and salinas on its trip over the commonwealth{27] san juan reported a wind gust of 73xc2xa0mph (117xc2xa0kmh){9] carolina reported gusts to 71xc2xa0mph (114xc2xa0kmh){27] and rainfall ranged from 598 inches (152xc2xa0mm) in the city to over 24 inches (610xc2xa0mm) in vieques{28] this excessive rainfall resulted in damage to roads landslides and collapsed bridges{28] this resulted in one death and the evacuation of 400 people near the rxc3xado grande de axc3xb1asco{28] a total of eight people were reported dead in puerto rico as a result of jeanne damages from the storm were estimated at 1695xc2xa0million (2004xc2xa0usd){29]haiti{edit]flooding in haitiby september 17 heavy rains totaling about 13xc2xa0inches (330xc2xa0mm) in the northern mountains of haiti caused severe flooding and mudslides in the department of artibonite causing particular damage in the coastal city of gonaxc3xafves where it affected about 80000 of the city's 100000 residents as of october 6 2004 the official report counted 3006 people dead with 2826 of those in gonaxc3xafves alone{30] another 2601 people were injured and 7 people dieddecades of deforestation left surrounding valleys unable to hold the 30 hours of rain from hurricane jeanne causing massive landslides aid trucks were forced to ford floodwaters and mudslides on national route 1 in addition the flooding destroyed all of the rice and fruit harvest in the artibonite which has been regarded as "haiti's breadbasket" some residents had buried unclaimed corpses in their backyards there were also mass burials of bodies tipped into a massive pit from dump trucks despite objections to their ceremonious nature and discouragement from the world health organization due to the popular but incorrect belief that dead bodies would lead to catastrophic outbreaks of exotic diseases{31]dominican republic{edit]in the dominican republic the storm dumped torrential flooding rains and killing over two dozen{32] damage totaled 270xc2xa0million (2004xc2xa0usd){33]united states{edit]see also: effects of hurricane jeanne in the mid-atlantic regionstorm total rainfall from jeannemillions in florida were left without electricity some for the third time in a month there were only five direct deaths in the mainland united states three in florida one in south carolina and one in virginia the final us damage was determined to be around 69 billion making it the 15th costliest hurricane in united states history{34] it was difficult to isolate this from damage caused by hurricane frances (and around polk county and highlands county from hurricane charley as well)as the storm moved northward east of the appalachian mountains it continued producing heavy rains and flash flooding rainfall exceeded 600xc2xa0inches (150xc2xa0mm) as far north as new jersey and pennsylvania{35] resulting in severe flash flooding in philadelphia pennsylvania and its pennsylvania and new jersey suburbs on september 28 tornadoes also touched down in wilmington delaware and cherry hill new jerseydamaged signs in orlando florida caused by jeannedelaware and maryland{edit]throughout delaware the remnants of jeanne produced between 4 and 8xc2xa0in (100 and 200xc2xa0mm) of rain{36] peaking at 71xc2xa0in (180xc2xa0mm) at the university of delaware{35] this led to widespread street flooding and several rivers overflowed their banks forty people had to be rescued from a bus along the white clay creek after the creek crested at 59xc2xa0ft (018xc2xa0m) above flood-stage{36] a strong f2 tornado touched down in the state injuring five people and leaving 1xc2xa0million in damages the tornado touched down in northern new castle county and tracked for 5xc2xa0mi (80xc2xa0km) and generated winds up to 130xc2xa0mph (210xc2xa0kmh) the county airport sustained significant damage five c-130 cargo planes were damaged thousands of pounds of jet fuel spilled and damaged hangars at a nearby industrial park metal siding was torn off buildings windows were shattered and power lines were downed a self-storage facility sustained substantial damage{37]in maryland jeanne produced up to 4xc2xa0in (100xc2xa0mm) of rain{35] triggering flash flooding throughout the state{38] numerous roads were flooded{39] including parts of maryland route 17{40] several rivers rose above their flood-stage with the big elk creek cresting at 93xc2xa0ft (28xc2xa0m) 03xc2xa0ft (0091xc2xa0m) above food-stage{41] a total of 50 roads were closed due to high water throughout the state numerous reports of stranded vehicles were sent to the emergency operations center in carroll county a group of inmates required rescue after the jail they were in flooded{42] one brief f0 tornado touched down in the state near solomons causing minor damage{43]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesas
