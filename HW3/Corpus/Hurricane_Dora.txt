saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalehurricane dora was first identified as a broad area of low pressure on augustxc2xa028 1964 as it moved off the west coast of africa into the atlantic ocean near dakar senegal{1] traveling west-southwestward{2] the system brushed the cape verde islands the following day by augustxc2xa031 images from the eighth television infrared observation satellite (tiros viii) depicted a developing storm with a central dense overcast banding features and cirrus outflow observations from ships in the vicinity of the storm indicated decreasing barometric pressures and wind gusts up to 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh) on septemberxc2xa01 reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system and determined that it had already become a tropical storm with sustained winds reaching 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) shortly thereafter the first advisory was issued on tropical storm dora and the center was estimated to be roughly 850xc2xa0mi (1370xc2xa0km) east of trinidad{1]{3]upon being classified on septemberxc2xa01 dora turned towards the northwest and intensified{2] several reconnaissance missions into the storm indicated that it attained hurricane status during the afternoon of septemberxc2xa02;{1] however in the official atlantic hurricane database it is not listed as reaching this intensity until the nighttime hours{2] increasing in size and strength{1] dora attained winds of 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh) early on septemberxc2xa03 the equivalent of a categoryxc2xa02 on the modern-day saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale{2] at the time meteorologists expected the storm to maintain a northwesterly course and be steered over open waters by a trough associated with hurricane cleo to the west{3]{4] however dora "missed" the trough and gradually turned towards the west on septemberxc2xa06{3] that day the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa04 equivalent storm with winds estimated at 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) and a central pressure of 942xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2782xc2xa0inhg){2]enlarged track of hurricane dora detailing its erratic track prior to landfallwhile executing the turn dora steadily weakened as its low-level inflow was disrupted by septemberxc2xa08 the storm restrengthened slightly and attained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){1]{3]{2] tracking westward towards florida dora's forward movement decreased and became erratic as it neared the coast early on septemberxc2xa09 the storm abruptly turned southeastward before moving north for several hours throughout the remainder of septemberxc2xa09 the hurricane executed three distinct cyclonic loops while maintaining a general westward motion{1] during the afternoon hours dora passed over the gulf stream resulting in its central pressure decreasing 9xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 027xc2xa0inhg) in a few hours{5]around 12:20xc2xa0am est on septemberxc2xa010 hurricane dora made landfall about 6xc2xa0mi (97xc2xa0km) north of st augustine florida with sustained winds between 115 and 125xc2xa0mph (185 and 205xc2xa0kmh){1] although estimated to have been a categoryxc2xa03 at landfall the highest winds onshore were believed to have been in the categoryxc2xa02 range{6] striking northeastern florida dora became the first tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the region{1] once onshore the storm gradually weakened losing hurricane status about 24xc2xa0hours later and began a gradual turn towards the northeast during the morning of septemberxc2xa012 dora became almost stationary over the southern border between alabama and georgia however the storm rapidly accelerated and re-emerged into the atlantic ocean on septemberxc2xa014 near the outer banks of north carolina hours after moving over water the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of dora were last mentioned on septemberxc2xa016 off the northeast coast of newfoundland{2]preparations{edit]caribbean{edit]upon dora's classification on
