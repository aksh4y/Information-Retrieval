begun in 1953 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of university and as a tribute to the alumni who perished in both world war i and world war iithe university of florida traces its origins to 1853 when the east florida seminary the oldest of the university of florida's four predecessor institutions was founded in ocala floridaon january 6 1853 governor thomas brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in florida{18] gilbert kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation and established the east florida seminary which operated until the outbreak of the civil war in 1861 the east florida seminary was florida's first state-supported institution of higher learning{19]james henry roper an educator from north carolina and a state senator from alachua county had opened a school in gainesville the gainesville academy in 1858 in 1866{20] roper offered his land and school to the state of florida in exchange for the east florida seminary's relocation to gainesville{21]the second major precursor to the university of florida was the florida agricultural college established at lake city by jordan probst in 1884 florida agricultural college became the state's first land-grant college under the morrill act in 1903 the florida legislature desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins changed the name of florida agricultural college to the "university of florida" a name the school would hold for only two years{22]"university of the state of florida"{edit]in 1905 the florida legislature passed the buckman act which consolidated the state's publicly supported higher education institutions the member of the legislature who wrote the act henry holland buckman later became the namesake of buckman hall one of the first buildings constructed on the new university's campus{23] the buckman act organized the state university system of florida and created the florida board of control to govern the system it also abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new "university of the state of florida" the four predecessor institutions consolidated to form the new university included the university of florida at lake city (formerly florida agricultural college) in lake city the east florida seminary in gainesville the st petersburg normal and industrial school in st petersburg and the south florida military college in bartow{24]the buckman act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and genderxe2x80x94the university of the state of florida for white men the florida female college for

university{26] on july 6 1905 the board of control selected gainesville for the new university campus andrew sledd president of the pre-existing university of florida at lake city was selected to be the first president of the new university of the state of florida the 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new university of the state of florida was legally created but operated on

buildings in the collegiate gothic style classes began on the new gainesville campus on september 26 1906 with 102 students enrolledin 1909 the school's name was simplified from the "university of the state of florida" to the "university of florida"the alligator was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911 after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants imprinted with an alligator emblem the school colors orange and blue are a reference to the region's heritage and an homage to the scottish and ulster-scots presbyterian heritage of the original founders of gainesville and alachua county most of whom were settlers from north carolina whose ancestors were primarily presbyterians of scottish descent who had come to america from county down and county antrim in what has since become northern ireland while some had come directly from the scottish lowlands{27]{28]{29] {30]statue of albert murphree the second president of the universitycollege reorganization{edit]in
