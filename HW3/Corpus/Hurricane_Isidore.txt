in the 2002 atlantic hurricane season isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in september{1] the tropical cyclone peaked as a category 3 hurricane causing damage as well as four fatalities in jamaica cuba mexico and the united states{2] isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern gulf coast as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a track change that brought the storm over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula for over a day which significantly weakened the cyclone its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which fell across southeast mexico and from the central united states gulf coast into the ohio valley{3]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 caribbean islands32 cuba33 southeast mexico34 central america35 eastern united states36 retirement4 see also5 references6 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon september 9 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa despite moving through a dry environment its convection became organized as an anticyclone developed over the wave on september 14 convection was well-organized enough around a small closed wind circulation to classify the system as tropical depression ten near trinidad and tobago{2] land interaction from venezuela later weakened the depression back to a tropical wave the wave continued west-northwestward through the caribbean and redeveloped into a tropical depression on september 17 while 140 miles (230xc2xa0km) south of jamaica{4]embedded within a weak steering current it drifted to the northwest and strengthened into tropical storm isidore on september 18 near jamaica{5] after grazing the island it quickly intensified to a hurricane late on september 19 while south of cuba isidore's maximum sustained winds reached 100 miles per hour (160xc2xa0kmh) near the isle of youth and weakened slightly to an 85 miles per hour (137xc2xa0kmh) hurricane as it made landfall on cabo frances late on september 20{1] the hurricane crossed the island then slowed as it moved westward across the gulf of mexico favorable conditions aloft with warm water temperatures allowed isidore to quickly intensify to a peak of 125 miles per hour (201xc2xa0kmh) winds on september 21{6]despite dvorak satellite estimates of 145 miles per hour (233xc2xa0kmh) reconnaissance aircraft indicated isidore remained a 125 miles per hour (201xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa03 hurricane with pressures dropping to 934xc2xa0mbar (276xc2xa0inhg) typical of a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane{7] it is the lowest minimum pressure ever observed for an atlantic hurricane which did not exceed categoryxc2xa03 intensity{1] with nearly ideal conditions for development isidore was forecast to reach winds of 150 miles per hour (240xc2xa0kmh) over the northern gulf of mexico{8] high pressures to its north forced it southward and isidore made landfall at telchac puerto in yucatxc3xa1n as a major hurricane on september 22 it weakened rapidly as it nearly stalled over yucatxc3xa1n and was only a minimal tropical storm after being inland for 30xc2xa0hourstropical storm isidore (left) lili (middle) and kyle on september 25the inner core of convection collapsed while over southeast mexico and upon moving northward and reaching the gulf of mexico again it was a large but weak tropical storm conditions favored significant strengthening but isidore did not redevelop central convection until reaching the northern gulf of mexico the strengthening system hit grand isle louisiana on september 26 as a 65 miles per hour (105xc2xa0kmh) tropical storm but weakened quickly into a tropical depression after moving inland the system raced to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone on september 27 before becoming absorbed in a frontal zone over pennsylvania that night{9]preparations{edit]tropical storm isidore making landfall in louisiana on september 26before isidore became a hurricane there were fears that the storm would end up being a significant threat{2] the upper level environment ahead of the storm was very favorable and the oceanic heat content was very high{10] just ten months after the destructive hurricane michelle hurricane isidore threatened to cause similar effects in cuba in preparation for the storm about 292000xc2xa0people and thousands of farm animals were evacuated in the pinar del rxc3xado province{11]{12] hurricane warnings were posted about 48xc2xa0hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the stormonce in the gulf of mexico hurricane isidore became a major category 3 storm with winds of 125 miles per hour (201xc2xa0kmh){1] the forecasts then predicted isidore to move westward in the gulf of mexico for a few days before turning northward towards the gulf coast as what was predicted by then to be a strong category 4 hurricane{13] initially expected to remain north of the peninsula hurricane warnings were issued just over a day prior to landfall with no watch preceding isidore's passage{14]{15] more than 70000xc2xa0people were evacuated{16] and ports on the gulf coast of yucatxc3xa1n were closed mexican authorities declared a state of emergency prior to the arrival of the storm{17] due to isidore's unexpected southward turn into the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula isidore weakened significantly to a tropical storm which limited potential damage along the united states gulf coast in preparation for the hurricane the red cross mobilized its members across texas alabama louisiana mississippi and florida days before isidore's expected landfall{16] volunteers were sent in the days prior to ensure families had a family disaster plan and a disaster supplies kit in their household hurricane watches raised for the united states gulf coast between cameron louisiana and pascagoula mississippi late on the morning of september 24 were discontinued early on the morning of september 25 when the storm was no longer expected to restrengthen into a hurricane{5]impact{edit]caribbean islands{edit]in the windward islands isidore was a weak tropical depression that caused no reported damage or casualties the cayman islands reported tropical storm force winds and likely experienced flooding to some degree but isidore caused no reported damage or casualties isidore brought heavy rains to jamaica totalling 272 inches (690xc2xa0mm) at cotton tree gully{5]cuba{edit]hurricane isidore approaching cuba on september 19hurricane isidore brought torrential rainfall with many areas reporting over 1 foot (300xc2xa0mm) of rain the maximum reported was 217 inches (550xc2xa0mm) at isabel rubio in western cuba{5] the rainfall combined with a 12 feet (37xc2xa0m) storm surge destroyed 77xc2xa0houses{11] caused power outages uprooted trees and blew off roofs{18] over 130 tobacco drying houses were affected to some degree damaging valuable tobacco stock{12] a total of 24000 metric tons of citrus and 132 metric tons of coffee were lost from the storm thousands of livestock perished{18] no deaths were reportedsoutheast mexico{edit]rainfall totals in mexico and the united stateshurricane isidore was one of only four storms to hit the north side of the yucatxc3xa1n since records have been kept it was the first tropical cyclone to hit the area since tropical depression greta in 1970 the first tropical storm since 1935 the first hurricane since 1888 and only major hurricane to ever hit the area{1]the storm shut down oil production of the mexican state-run oil company pemex drilling operations as well as exports from mexico stopped for one week which cost the oil company us1087xc2xa0million{19] the gulf coast island of isla arena was nearly covered by isidore's storm surge its residents evacuated prior to the storm's passage{20]hurricane isidore hit near mxc3xa9rida yucatxc3xa1n as a 125 miles per hour (201xc2xa0kmh) hurricane and remained over the area for around 36xc2xa0hours over 30 inches (760xc2xa0mm) of rainfall fell with the maximum recorded near campeche{3] the storm surge reached as high as 6 metres (20xc2xa0ft) over southern portions of yucatxc3xa1n state nearly one-third of all fishing vessels were damaged by isidore{21] nearly 36500xc2xa0houses were destroyed in yucatxc3xa1n from the intense winds{21] 83000 homes damaged and 500000 were left homeless{19] downed trees and power lines were common over much of the northern yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{22] and 75 of barns and warehouses were either severely damaged or destroyed damage to crops and livestock was extreme; 2000xc2xa0square kilometres of maize and 400xc2xa0square kilometres of fruit trees were damaged across the country{23] a total of 70 of the poultry production and livestock were lost during the storm in yucatxc3xa1n damage to mexico's power grid reached us1976xc2xa0million over one-fourth of the roads across the peninsula were moderately or severely damaged which resulted in losses of us988xc2xa0million to rural areas{19] farming in campeche experienced significant damage with 30000xc2xa0cattle and 100000xc2xa0acres (400xc2xa0kmxc2xb2) of agricultural land lostthroughout the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula there were 17 deaths were attributed to hurricane isidore two of which were indirectly related to the storm damage in the country totaled 950xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd){20]{24]central america{edit]isidore caused heavy rains in guatemala due to upslope flow from the pacific ocean which led to landslides and flooding across southern and western portions of the country the rains led to the drowning of two people when they tried to cross a rain-swollen river three hundred and fifty households reported losses{18]{20]eastern united states{edit]in the open gulf of mexico hurricane isidore and later hurricane lili contributed to the shutdown of offshore oil and gas platforms the effects of back-to-back storms resulted in the loss of production of 144 million barrels (2290000xc2xa0m3) of oil and 889xc2xa0billion cubic feet (252xc3x97109xc2xa0m3) of natural gas a storm surge of 83 feet (25xc2xa0m) was measured at rigoletes louisiana and at gulfport harbor mississippi{5] hurricane isidore brought widespread heavy rainfall from the central gulf coast into the ohio valley with a maximum of 1597 inches (406xc2xa0mm) at metairie louisiana{3] the flooding was responsible for moderate crop damage with a total of 330xc2xa0million in damage (2002xc2xa0usd 360xc2xa0million 2006xc2xa0usd){25] isidore claimed five lives in the us: four direct and one indirect the indirect death was from a man that went into cardiac arrest in mississippi whereas the other four were drowning deaths{5]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesthe name isidore was retired in the spring of 2003 and will never be used for an atlantic hurricane again{26] it was
