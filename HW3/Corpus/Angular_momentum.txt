the conservation of its angular momentumin physics angular momentum (rarely moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum it is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity xe2x80x93 the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torquethe definition of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector rxc3x97p the cross product of the particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector p = mv this definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids or physical fields unlike momentum angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen since the particle's position is measured from it the angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity xcfx89 of the object (how fast it rotates about an axis) via the moment of inertia i (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation) however while xcfx89 always points in the direction of the rotation axis the angular momentum l may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributedangular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of a system is the (pseudo)vector sum of the angular momenta for continua or fields one uses integration the total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components: "orbital" angular momentum about an axis outside the object plus "spin" angular momentum through the centre of mass of the objecttorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum analogous to force the conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted the high rotational rates of neutron stars the falling cat problem and precession of tops and gyros applications include the gyrocompass control moment gyroscope inertial guidance systems reaction wheels flying discs or frisbees and earth's rotation to name a few in general conservation does limit the possible motion of a system but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion isin quantum mechanics angular momentum is an operator with quantized eigenvalues angular momentum is subject to the heisenberg uncertainty principle meaning that only one component can be measured with definite precision; the other two cannot also the "spin" of elementary particles does not correspond to literal spinning motion{1]contents1 angular

originangular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely a pseudovector) that represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational velocity about a particular axis in the simple case of revolution of a particle in a circle about a center of rotation the particle remaining always in the same plane and having always the same distance from the center it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum and treat it as a scalar{2] angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum thus where linear momentum p{displaystyle p} is proportional

shape of the matter unlike linear speed which occurs in a straight line angular speed occurs about a center of rotation therefore strictly speaking l{displaystyle l} should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that center{4]because i=r2m{displaystyle i=r^{2}m} for a single particle and xcfx89=vr{displaystyle omega ={frac {v}{r}}} for circular motion angular momentum can be

circular motion where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius r{displaystyle r}discussion{edit]angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear momentum like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and displacement unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of position and shapemany problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space be it in actual rotation about it or simply moving past it where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point xe2x80x94 can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? energy the ability to do work can be stored in matter by setting it in motion xe2x80x94 a combination of its inertia and its displacement inertia is measured by its mass and displacement by its velocity their product(amount of inertia)xc3x97(amount of displacement)=amount of (inertiaxc2xb7displacement)massxc3x97velocity=momentummxc3x97v=p{displaystyle {egin{aligned}({ext{amount of

this momentum to a central point introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly for instance a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is in effect at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel's radius its momentum turning the lever about the center point this imaginary lever is known as the moment arm it has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length an effect known as a moment hence the particle's momentum referred to a particular point(moment arm)xc3x97(amount of inertia)xc3x97(amount of displacement)=moment of

called as here the moment of momentum of the particle versus that particular center point the equation l=rmv{displaystyle l=rmv} combines a moment (a mass m{displaystyle m} turning moment arm r{displaystyle r}) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed v{displaystyle v} linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance r{displaystyle r} and the angular speed xcfx89{displaystyle omega } versus the point: v=rxcfx89{displaystyle v=romega } another moment hence angular momentum contains a double moment: l=rmrxcfx89{displaystyle l=rmromega } simplifying slightly l=r2mxcfx89{displaystyle l=r^{2}momega } the quantity r2m{displaystyle r^{2}m} is the particle's moment of inertia sometimes called the second moment of mass it is a measure of rotational inertia{8]moment of inertia (shown here) and therefore angular momentum is different for every possible configuration of mass and axis of rotationbecause rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum it necessarily includes all of the complications of moment of inertia which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation{9] therefore the total moment of inertia and the angular momentum is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bitsfor a rigid body for instance a wheel or an asteroid the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of the body it may or may not pass through the center of mass or it may lie completely outside of the body for the same body angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place{10] it reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass{11]for a collection of objects revolving about a center for instance all of the bodies of the solar system the orientations may be somewhat organized as is the solar system with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis their orientations may also be completely randomin brief the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the moment arm) the greater the moment of inertia and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity in many cases the moment of inertia and hence the angular momentum can be simplified by{12]i=k2m{displaystyle i=k^{2}m}where k{displaystyle k} is the radius of gyration the distance from the axis at which the entire mass m{displaystyle m} may be considered as concentratedsimilarly for a point mass m{displaystyle m} the moment of inertia is defined asi=r2m{displaystyle i=r^{2}m}where r{displaystyle r} is the radius of the point mass from the center of rotationand for any collection of particles mi{displaystyle m_{i}} as the sumxe2x88x91iii=xe2x88x91iri2mi{displaystyle sum _{i}i_{i}=sum _{i}r_{i}^{2}m_{i}}angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its units versus linear momentum: kgxc2xb7m2s nxc2xb7mxc2xb7s or jxc2xb7s for angular momentum versus kgxc2xb7ms or nxc2xb7s for linear momentum angular momentum's units can be interpreted as torquexc2xb7seconds workxc2xb7seconds or energyxc2xb7seconds an object with angular momentum of l nxc2xb7mxc2xb7s can be reduced to zero rotation (all of the energy can be transferred out of it) by an angular impulse of l nxc2xb7mxc2xb7s{13] or equivalently by torque or work of l nxc2xb7m for one second or energy of l j for one second{14]the plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass{15] is sometimes called the invariable plane because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system free from outside influences are considered{16] one such plane is the invariable plane of the solar systemangular momentum and torque{edit]see also: torque xc2xa7xc2xa0definition and relation to angular momentumnewton's second law of motion can be expressed mathematicallyf=ma{displaystyle mathbf {f} =mmathbf {a} }or force = mass xc3x97 acceleration the rotational equivalent isxcfx84=ixcexb1{displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}=i{oldsymbol {alpha }}}or torque = moment of inertia xc3x97 angular acceleration because angular acceleration is the time derivative of angular velocity this is equivalent to xcfx84=idxcfx89dt{displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}=i{frac {d{oldsymbol {omega }}}{dt}}} rearranging into a form suitable for integration xcfx84=d(ixcfx89)dt{displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}={frac {d(i{oldsymbol {omega }})}{dt}}} and xcfx84dt=d(ixcfx89){displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}dt=d(i{oldsymbol {omega }})} and integrating with respect to timexe2x88xabxcfx84dt=ixcfx89+constant{displaystyle int {oldsymbol {au }}dt=i{oldsymbol {omega }}+{ext{constant}}}therefore a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum known as angular impulse by analogy with impulse which is defined as the change in translational momentum the constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body before the torque began to act in particular if torque xcfx84=0{displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}=mathbf {0} } then angular momentum l=0+constant{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mathbf {0} +{ext{constant}}}{17] that is if no torque acts upon a body then its angular momentum remains constant converselyl=ixcfx89{displaystyle mathbf {l} =i{oldsymbol {omega }}}or angular momentum = moment of inertia xc3x97 angular velocity and its time derivative isdldt=didtxcfx89+idxcfx89dt{displaystyle {frac {dmathbf {l} }{dt}}={frac {di}{dt}}{oldsymbol {omega }}+i{frac {d{oldsymbol {omega }}}{dt}}}because moment of inertia is constant didt{displaystyle {frac {di}{dt}}} is zero and dldt=0+idxcfx89dt{displaystyle {frac {dmathbf {l} }{dt}}=0+i{frac {d{oldsymbol {omega }}}{dt}}} which as above reduces todldt=ixcexb1{displaystyle {frac {dmathbf {l} }{dt}}=i{oldsymbol {alpha }}}therefore the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied torque about that center{4] if angular momentum is constant dldt=0{displaystyle {frac {dmathbf {l} }{dt}}=0} and no torque is appliedconservation of angular momentum{edit]a figure skater conserves angular momentum xe2x80x93 her rotational speed increases as her moment of inertia decreases by drawing in her arms and legsa rotational analog of newton's third law of motion might be written "in a closed system no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque"{18] hence angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved){19]similarly a rotational analog of newton's second law of motion might be "a change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque"{18] since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum then if torque is zero angular momentum is constant as above a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system therefore requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence in the form of a torque acts upon it{20]a rotational analog of newton's first law of motion might be written "a body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless acted by an external torque"{18] thus with no external influence to act upon it the original angular momentum of the system is conserved{21]the conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing central force motion if the net force on some body is directed always toward some point the center then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center as all of the force is directed along the radius vector and none is perpendicular to the radius mathematically torque xcfx84=rxc3x97f=0{displaystyle {oldsymbol {au }}=mathbf {r} imes mathbf {f} =mathbf {0} } because in this case r{displaystyle mathbf {r} } and f{displaystyle mathbf {f} } are parallel vectors therefore the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant this is the case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary central force motion is also used in the analysis of the bohr model of the atomfor a planet angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms the conservation of angular momentum in the earthxe2x80x93moon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from earth to moon due to tidal torque the moon exerts on the earth this in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of earth at about 657 nanoseconds per day{22] and in gradual increase of the radius of moon's orbit at about 382xc2xa0centimeters per year{23]the torque caused by the two opposing forces fg and xe2x88x92fg causes a change in the angular momentum l in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum) this causes the top to precessthe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation by bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved) then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increasethe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n2conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint for example a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis and another about its precession axis also in any planetary system the planets star(s) comets and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conservednoether's theorem states that every conservation law is associated with a symmetry (invariant) of the underlying physics the symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance the fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved{24]angular momentum in orbital mechanics{edit]main article: specific relative angular momentumin astrodynamics and celestial mechanics a massless (or per unit mass) angular momentum is defined{25]h=rxc3x97v{displaystyle mathbf {h} =mathbf {r} imes mathbf {v} }called specific angular momentum note that l=mh{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mmathbf {h} } mass is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations because motion is defined by gravity the primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is in effect stationary all bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way regardless of mass and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditionssolid bodies{edit]for a continuous mass distribution with density function xcfx81(r) a differential volume element dv with position vector r within the mass has a mass element dm = xcfx81(r)dv therefore the infinitesimal

definition){edit]the 3-angular momentum as a bivector (plane element) and axial vector of a particle of mass m with instantaneous 3-position x and 3-momentum pin modern (20th century) theoretical physics angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum xe2x80x93 see below) is described using a different formalism instead of a classical pseudovector in this formalism angular momentum is the 2-form noether charge associated with rotational invariance as a result angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant{citation needed]in classical mechanics the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:l=rxe2x88xa7p{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mathbf {r} wedge mathbf {p} }in which the exterior product xe2x88xa7 replaces the cross product xc3x97 (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent) this has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element defined from the x and p vectors and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher) in cartesian coordinates:l=(xpyxe2x88x92ypx)exxe2x88xa7ey+(ypzxe2x88x92zpy)eyxe2x88xa7ez+(zpxxe2x88x92xpz)ezxe2x88xa7ex=lxyexxe2x88xa7ey+lyzeyxe2x88xa7ez+lzxezxe2x88xa7ex{displaystyle {egin{array}{rl}mathbf {l}

l_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}}the angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor with components xcfx89ij the relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:{28]lij=iijkxe2x84x93xcfx89kxe2x84x93{displaystyle l_{ij}=i_{ijkell }omega _{kell }}again this equation in l and xcfx89 as tensors is true in any number of dimensions this equation also appears in the geometric algebra formalism in which l and xcfx89 are bivectors and the moment of inertia is a mapping between themin relativistic

the particlein each of the above cases for a system of particles the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta and the centre of mass is for the systemangular momentum in quantum mechanics{edit]main article: angular momentum operatorangular momentum in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in classical mechanics in relativistic quantum mechanics it differs even more in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operatorspin orbital and total angular momentum{edit]main article: spin (physics)angular momenta of a classical objectleft: "spin" angular momentum s is really orbital angular momentum of the object at every pointright: extrinsic orbital angular momentum l about an axistop: the moment of inertia tensor i and angular velocity xcfx89 (l is not always parallel to xcfx89){29]bottom: momentum p and its radial position r from the axisthe total angular momentum (spin plus orbital) is j for a quantum particle the interpretations are different; particle spin does not have the above interpretationthe classical definition of angular momentum as l=rxc3x97p{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mathbf {r} imes mathbf {p} } can be carried over to quantum mechanics by reinterpreting r as the quantum position operator and p as the quantum momentum operator l is then an operator specifically called the orbital angular momentum operator the components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group so(3) indeed these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum hilbert space{30] (see also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations)however in quantum physics there is another type of angular momentum called spin angular momentum represented by the spin operator s almost all elementary particles have spin spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum all elementary particles have a characteristic spin for example electrons have "spin 12" (this actually means "spin xc4xa72") while photons have "spin 1" (this actually means "spin xc4xa7")finally there is total angular momentum j which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields (for one particle j = l + s) conservation of angular momentum applies to j but not to l or s; for example the spinxe2x80x93orbit interaction allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between l and s with the total remaining constant electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum but can also have fractional values{31]quantization{edit]in quantum mechanics angular momentum is quantized xe2x80x93 that is it cannot vary continuously but only in "quantum leaps" between certain allowed values for any system the following restrictions on measurement results apply where xe2x84x8f{displaystyle hbar } is the reduced planck constant and n^{displaystyle {hat {n}}} is any direction vector such as x y or z:if you measurethe result can beln^{displaystyle l_{hat

around the circle but it cannot have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 83 in quantum mechanics angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason(there are additional restrictions as well see angular momentum operator for details)the reduced planck constant xe2x84x8f{displaystyle hbar } is tiny by everyday standards about 10xe2x88x9234 j s and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects however it is very important in the microscopic world for example the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentumquantization of angular momentum was first postulated by niels bohr in his bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by erwin schrxc3xb6dinger in his schrxc3xb6dinger equationuncertainty{edit]in the definition l=rxc3x97p{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mathbf {r} imes mathbf {p} } six operators are involved: the position operators rx{displaystyle r_{x}} ry{displaystyle r_{y}} rz{displaystyle r_{z}} and the momentum operators px{displaystyle p_{x}} py{displaystyle p_{y}} pz{displaystyle p_{z}} however the heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision therefore there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum it turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's magnitude and its component along one axisthe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute for example lxlyxe2x89xa0lylx{displaystyle l_{x}l_{y}eq l_{y}l_{x}} (for the precise commutation relations see angular momentum operator)total angular momentum as generator of rotations{edit]as mentioned above orbital angular momentum l is defined as in classical mechanics: l=rxc3x97p{displaystyle mathbf {l} =mathbf {r} imes mathbf {p} } but total angular momentum j is defined in a different more basic way: j is defined as the "generator of rotations"{32] more specifically j is defined so that the operatorr(n^xcfx95)xe2x89xa1expxe2x81xa1(xe2x88x92ixe2x84x8fxcfx95jxe2x8bx85n^){displaystyle r({hat {n}}phi )equiv exp left(-{frac {i}{hbar }}phi mathbf {j} cdot {hat {mathbf {n} }}right)}is the rotation operator that takes any system and rotates it by angle xcfx95{displaystyle phi } about the axis n^{displaystyle {hat {mathbf {n} }}} (the "exp" in the formula refers to operator exponential) to put this the other way around whatever our quantum hilbert space is we expect that the rotation group so(3) will act on it there is then an associated action of the lie algebra so(3) of so(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operatorsthe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between lie algebras and lie groups in mathematics the close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in noether's theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariantangular momentum in electrodynamics{edit]see also: momentum (particle in field)when describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field the canonical momentum p (derived from the lagrangian for this system) is not gauge invariant as a consequence the canonical angular momentum l = r xc3x97 p is not gauge invariant either instead the momentum that is physical the so-called kinetic momentum (used throughout this article) is (in si units)p=mv=pxe2x88x92ea{displaystyle mathbf {p} =mmathbf {v} =mathbf {p} -emathbf {a} }where e is the electric charge of the particle and a the magnetic vector potential of the electromagnetic field the gauge-invariant angular momentum that is kinetic angular momentum is given byk=rxc3x97(pxe2x88x92ea){displaystyle mathbf {k} =mathbf {r} imes (mathbf {p} -emathbf {a} )}the interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article

{r} t)}the above identities are valid locally  ie in each space point r{displaystyle mathbf {r} } in a given moment t{displaystyle {t}}history{edit]newton in the principia hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the first law of motiona top whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions does not cease its rotation otherwise than as it is retarded by the air the greater bodies of the planets and comets meeting with less resistance in more free spaces preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time{35]he did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the principiafrom such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centres but these are cases which i do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject{36]however his geometric proof of the law of areas is an outstanding example of newton's genius and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a central forcethe law of areas{edit]main articles: classical central-force problem and areal velocitynewton's derivation{edit]newton's derivation of the area law using geometric meansas a planet orbits the sun the line between the sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time this had been known since kepler expounded his second law of planetary motion newton derived a unique geometric proof and went on to show that the attractive force of the sun's gravity was the cause of all of kepler's lawsduring the first interval of time an object is in motion from point a to point b undisturbed it would continue to point c during the second interval when the object arrives at b it receives an impulse directed toward point s the impulse gives it a small added velocity toward s such that if this were its only velocity it would move from b to v during the second interval by the rules of velocity composition these two velocities add and point c is found by construction of parallelogram bccv thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point c at the end of the second interval because the triangles sbc and sbc have the same base sb and the same height bc or vc they have the same area by symmetry triangle sbc also has the same area as triangle sab therefore the object has swept out equal areas sab and sbc in equal timesat point c the object receives another impulse toward s again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to d thus it continues to e and beyond the triangles sab sbc sbc scd scd sde sde all having the same area allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller the path abcde approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curvenote that because this derivation is geometric and no specific force is applied it proves a more general law than kepler's second law of planetary motion it shows that the law of areas applies to any central force attractive or repulsive continuous or non-continuous or zeroconservation of angular momentum in the law of areas{edit]the proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles that is the lines from s to the object are equivalent to the radius r and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of velocity vxe2x8axa5 hence if the area swept per unit time is constant then by the triangular area formula 12(base)(height) the product (base)(height) and therefore the product rvxe2x8axa5 are constant: if r and the base length are decreased vxe2x8axa5 and height must increase proportionally mass is constant therefore angular momentum rmvxe2x8axa5 is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocityin the case of triangle sbc area is equal to 12(sb)(vc) wherever c is eventually located due to the impulse applied at b the product (sb)(vc) and therefore rmvxe2x8axa5 remain constant similarly so for each of the trianglesafter newton{edit]leonhard euler daniel bernoulli and patrick d'arcy all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity a result of their analysis of kepler's second law of planetary motion it is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter{37]in 1736 euler like newton touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his mechanica without further developing them{38]bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a "moment of rotational motion" possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it{39]in 1799 pierre-simon laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation xe2x80x94 his invariable planelouis poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation and elaborated on the "conservation of moments"in 1852 lxc3xa9on foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the earth's rotationwilliam j m rankine's 1858 manual of applied mechanics defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point and such that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotationin an 1872 edition of the same book rankine stated that "the term angular momentum was introduced by mr hayward"{40] probably referring to rb hayward's article on a direct method of estimating velocities accelerations and all similar quantities with respect to axes moveable in any manner in space with applications{41] which was introduced in 1856 and published in 1864 rankine was mistaken as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries{42] however hayward's article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the english-speaking world before this angular momentum was typically referred to as "momentum of rotation" in english{43]see
