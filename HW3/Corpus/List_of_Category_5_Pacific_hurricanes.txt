b'list of category 5 pacific hurricanes - wikipedia list of category 5 pacific hurricanesfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchtracks of all categoryxc2xa05 pacific hurricanes east of the international datelinecategoryxc2xa05 hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach categoryxc2xa05 intensity on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale they are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet earth they are rare in the eastern pacific ocean and generally form only once every several years in general categoryxc2xa05s form in clusters in single years landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemispherethe term "hurricane" is used for tropical cyclones in the pacific ocean north of the equator and east of the international date line a categoryxc2xa05 pacific hurricane is therefore a tropical cyclone in the north pacific ocean that reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity east of the international dateline identical phenomena in the north pacific ocean west of the dateline are called "typhoons" or "super typhoons" categoryxc2xa05 super typhoons generally happen several times per season so cyclones of that intensity are not exceptional for that region this difference in terminology therefore excludes storms such as super typhoon paka and super typhoon oliwa of 1997 and super typhoon genevieve of 2014 which formed east of the dateline but did not reach categoryxc2xa05 intensity until after crossing the datelinecontents1 statistics2 category 5 pacific hurricanes3 climatology4 landfalls5 see also6 referencesstatistics{edit]saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scaletdtsc1c2c3c4c5a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane is defined as having sustained windspeeds of at least 137 knots (158xc2xa0mph; 254xc2xa0kmh) over a one-minute period 10 metres (33xc2xa0ft) above the ground{1]{2] as a tropical cyclone is moving its wind field is asymmetric in the northern hemisphere the strongest winds are on the right side of the storm (relative to the direction of motion) the highest winds given in advisories are those from the right side{3]since the 1959 season only 15 hurricanes are known to have reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity there are no known categoryxc2xa05 storms occurring before 1959 it is possible that some earlier storms reached categoryxc2xa05 over open waters but they were never recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea{4]category 5 pacific hurricanes{edit]hurricane linda at its peak intensity on septemberxc2xa012 1997hurricane patricia shortly after its record peak intensity on octoberxc2xa023 2015this lists all of the categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes in the order in which they formed only 1994's hurricane emilia and 2006's hurricane ioke have reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity more than once; that is by weakening into a categoryxc2xa04 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a categoryxc2xa05 stormbefore the advent of reliable geostationary satellite coverage in 1966 the number of eastern pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated{5] it is therefore very possible that there are additional categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes other than those listed but they were not reported and therefore not recognized however the lack of pacific categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes during the late 1970s 1980s and early 1990s is certain{4]the minimum central pressure of these storms is for the most part estimated from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique in the case of kenna{6] ava{7] and patricia the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm{4] because of the estimation of central pressures it is possible that other storms more intense than these have formed{8]the reason for estimating the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) is the fact that most of these storms did not threaten land{9] as kenna and patricia were threatening land their pressures were measured by hurricane hunters using dropsondes{6] while hurricane ava never threatened land{4] it too was flown into by hurricane hunters to test equipment and conduct research{7]older storms have incomplete pressure readings since there were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships land-based observations or reconnaissance aircraft when available ava's minimum known pressure was measured when it was a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane for example{4] john and gilma have incomplete pressures because the central pacific hurricane center in general did not publish pressure on systems in the central pacific (140xc2xb0w to the dateline) at the time{10] however it should be noted that this list is not identical to the list of most intense pacific hurricanes the most intense known categoryxc2xa04 storm in the eastern pacific was 2014's odile the lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars lower than that of some category 5's such as guillermo{4]hurricanes have reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity during every month from june to october the earliest categoryxc2xa05 to form in a season is 1973's hurricane ava which formed on junexc2xa07 the latest categoryxc2xa05 to form in a season is hurricane kenna which reached peak intensity on october 24 hurricanes ava gilma ioke linda and patricia are the most intense storms to form in their respective months there have been no may november or off-season categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes{4]two pacific hurricanes are known to have reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity multiple times: emilia and ioke both did it twice and ioke reached categoryxc2xa05 status a third time as a typhoon while in the western pacific{4] hurricane ioke was tied for the longest-lasting categoryxc2xa05 hurricane recorded spending 42xc2xa0hours at that strength{11] while hurricanes john and linda had the longest time spent consecutively at that intensity{4]hurricane hernan off the coast of mexico on septemberxc2xa01 2002 at peak strengthmicrowave radar in the tail of a c130 during a flight into hurricane avalist of categoryxc2xa05 pacific hurricanes{4]stormnameseasondates as acategory 5time as acategory 5 (hours)peak one-minutesustained windspressuremphkmhhpainhgpatsy !patsy000000001959-09-06-0000 19590906 !september 67000600000000000000xe2x99xa0 61752805000000000000000000xe2x99xa0 unknownava !ava000000001973-06-07-0000 19730607 !june 77001240000000000000xe2x99xa0 241602609152702emilia !emilia000000001994-07-19-0000 19940719 !july 19xe2x80x93217001180000000000000xe2x99xa0 181602609262734gilma !gilma000000001994-07-24-0000 19940724 !july 24xe2x80x93257001180000000000000xe2x99xa0 181602609202717john !john000000001994-08-22-0000 19940822 !august 22xe2x80x93247001420000000000000xe2x99xa0 421752809292743guillermo !guillermo000000001997-08-04-0000 19970804 !august 4xe2x80x9357001240000000000000xe2x99xa0 241602609192714linda !linda000000001997-09-12-0000 19970912 !september 12xe2x80x93147001420000000000000xe2x99xa0 421852959022664elida !elida000000002002-07-25-0000 20020725 !july 257000600000000000000xe2x99xa0 61602609212720hernan !hernan000000002002-09-01-0000 20020901 !september 17001120000000000000xe2x99xa0 121602609212720kenna !kenna000000002002-10-24-0000 20021024 !october 247001180000000000000xe2x99xa0 181652709132696ioke !ioke000000002006-08-24-0000 20060824 !august 24xe2x80x93267001420000000000000xe2x99xa0 421602609152702rick !rick000000002009-10-18-0000 20091018 !october 187001240000000000000xe2x99xa0 241802859062675celia !celia000000002010-06-25-0000 20100625 !june 257001120000000000000xe2x99xa0 121602609212720marie !marie000000002014-08-24-0000 20140824 !august 247000600000000000000xe2x99xa0 61602609182711patricia !patricia000000002015-10-23-0000 20151023 !october 22xe2x80x93237001230000000000000xe2x99xa0 232153458722575 for its first time as a categoryxc2xa05 emilia was at that intensity for 6xc2xa0hours; the second time was for 12 for a total of 18xc2xa0hours{12] for its first time as a categoryxc2xa05 ioke was at that intensity for 18xc2xa0hours; the second time was 24 additional hours east of the dateline giving a total of 42xc2xa0hours{4] ioke did not lose categoryxc2xa05 status on august 26 however it moved into the western north pacific and thus was no longer considered a hurricane but rather a typhoonclimatology{edit]hurricane guillermo the first of two categoryxc2xa05s during the 1997 seasonin the eastern pacific categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes usually occur only in el nixc3xb1o years during el nixc3xb1o years conditions are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear this is why categoryxc2xa05s cluster in single seasons the effects of el nixc3xb1o are most significant in the central pacific (140xc2xb0w to the dateline){13]the general lack of categoryxc2xa05s in non warm-enso years is because of there being limited space for development the prevailing ocean currents of the area carry warm water to the west as there is no large piece of land to block the water and cause it to "pile up" like in the atlantic the area suitable for all tropical cyclones is small farther out to sea while waters are still warm wind shear limits the development of tropical cyclones in the waters south of hawaii this makes an otherwise ideal region unfavorable for tropical cyclonesthis does not mean that a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane cannot form outside of an el nixc3xb1o event the entire year of 1959 was neither an el nixc3xb1o or a la nixc3xb1a but it had one categoryxc2xa05 hurricane (patsy) most of 1973 was during a la nixc3xb1a which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern pacific yet hurricane ava a category 5 hurricane formed in june of that year{14] the 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 seasons are the only pairs of seasons in which a category 5 hurricane formed in consecutive years (rick and celia and marie and patricia respectively){15]landfalls{edit]hurricane kenna one of only three categoryxc2xa05 pacific hurricanes to make landfall at any intensityof all of the categoryxc2xa05 pacific hurricanes the only ones to make landfall at any intensity were hurricane kenna hurricane rick and hurricane patricia none made landfall as categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes; patricia and kenna had weakened to categoryxc2xa04 at the time of their landfalls and rick was a tropical storm at its landfall patricia was the strongest landfall among pacific hurricanes; 1976's hurricane madeline and 1992's hurricane iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall both of which didn't reach categoryxc2xa05 strength but made landfall as stronger category 4 storms than kenna{6] originally a hurricane in 1959 was thought to have struck manzanillo at categoryxc2xa05 intensity but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane and made landfall with the same winds as kenna{16] patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane near manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016in addition to these three systems hurricanes john linda and ioke all threatened land for a while john and ioke had minimal impact on johnston atoll and john caused heavy surf in hawaii{12] linda was briefly forecast to approach southern california and it passed close to socorro island near peak intensity{11]{17]the reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west{18] in the atlantic this sends hurricanes towards north america in the eastern pacific this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear hawaii the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern pacific is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low oddssee also{edit]tropical cyclones portalweather portalbook: category 5 pacific hurricaneslist of tropical cycloneslist of the most intense tropical cycloneslist of pacific hurricane seasonslist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneslist of category 4 pacific hurricanesreferences{edit]^ "the saffir-simpson hurricane scale" national hurricane center 2007-08-17 retrieved 2008-09-14xc2xa0^ chris landsea "subject: d4) what does "maximum sustained wind" meanxc2xa0? how does it relate to gusts in tropical cyclones?" faq: hurricane typhoons and tropical cyclones atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory hurricane research division retrieved 2006-01-04xc2xa0^ chris landsea "subject: d4) what does "maximum sustained wind" meanxc2xa0? how does it relate to gusts in tropical cyclones?" faq: hurricane typhoons and tropical cyclones atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory hurricane research division retrieved 2006-01-04xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i j k "eastern north pacific tracks file 1949-2007" national hurricane center 2008-03-21 archived from the original (plaintext) on 2008-08-22 retrieved 2008-09-14xc2xa0^ chris landsea (2002-06-11) "subject: e10) what are the average most and least tropical cyclones occurring in each basin?" faq: hurricane typhoons and tropical cyclones atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory hurricane research division retrieved 2006-01-04xc2xa0^ a b c james franklin (2002-12-26) "tropical cyclone report hurricane kenna" national hurricane center archived from the original on 2014-07-16 retrieved 2008-09-14xc2xa0^ a b fj hoelzl (1973-06-06) "wea01151 noaa's national weather service (nws) collection" noaa photo library national oceanic and atmospheric administration retrieved 2008-09-14xc2xa0^ max mayfield (1997-10-02) "preliminary report hurricane guillermo" national hurricane center retrieved 2008-09-16xc2xa0^ neal dorst "subject: h2) who are the "hurricane hunters" and what are they looking for?" faq: hurricane typhoons and tropical cyclones atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory hurricane research division retrieved 2006-01-04xc2xa0^ jim gross (1989-08-30) "preliminary report hurricane dalilia" (gif) national hurricane center pxc2xa03 retrieved 2006-01-04xc2xa0^ a b andy nash;
