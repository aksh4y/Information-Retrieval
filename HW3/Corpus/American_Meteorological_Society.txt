society has a membership of more than 13000 weather water and climate scientists professionals researchers educators students and enthusiasts{citation needed]ams offers numerous programs and services in the sphere of water weather and climate sciences it publishes eleven atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic journals (in print and online) sponsors as many as twelve conferences annually and administers professional certification programs and awards the ams policy and education programs promote scientific knowledge and work to increase public understanding of science there is also an extensive network of local and student ams chapters{citation needed]ams headquarters is located at 45 beacon street adjacent to the boston common in boston massachusetts the headquarters building was designed by charles bulfinch as the third harrison gray otis house in 1806 and was purchased and renovated by ams in 1958 with staff moving into the building in 1960 in 2012 ams purchased the building

maintains professional certification programs: the certified broadcast meteorologist (cbm) sets a professional standard in broadcast meteorology and the certified consulting meteorologist (ccm) establishes high standards of technical competence character and experience for consultants who provide advice in meteorology to the public the ams seal of approval was launched in 1957 to recognize on-air meteorologists for their sound delivery of weather information to the general public many seal holders are still active though the original seal was succeeded by the cbm those looking for an expert can consult the listings of all ams certified individuals{3]awards{edit]ams recognizes excellent work with over 30 different awards ranging from outstanding research contributions in specific fields to awards for excellence in teaching or broadcasting outstanding books exceptional service in forecasting and more including its highest honor: the carl-gustaf rossby medal{4]ams also awards
