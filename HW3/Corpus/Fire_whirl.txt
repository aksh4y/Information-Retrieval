b'fire whirl - wikipedia fire whirlfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searcha fire whirl with flames in the vortexa fire whirl xe2x80x93 also commonly known as a fire devil or (in many cases) erroneously as a fire tornado firenado or fire twister xe2x80x93 is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash they usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling eddies of air these eddies can contract into a tornado-like vortex that sucks in burning debris and combustible gasesfire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base also even in such cases even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes in that their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting rather than a tornadic mesocyclone aloft the literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon much more powerful and destructive than the a typical fire whirl in which the wildfire generates a pyrocumulonimbus cloud that then spawns a tornado when this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone it fans flames enormously draws flame and burning debris into itself and scatters burning debris over a wide areacontents1 formation2 examples3 classification4 references41 notes42 bibliography5 external linksformation{edit]a fire whirl consists of a burning core and a rotating pocket of air a fire whirl can reach up to 2000xc2xa0xc2xb0f (1090xc2xa0xc2xb0c){1] often fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind which can turn into a vortex of fire this causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirl's coremost of the largest fire whirls are spawned from wildfires they form when a warm updraft and convergence from the wildfire are present{2] they are usually 10-50 meters tall a few meters wide and last only a few minutes however some can be more than a kilometer tall contain winds over 160 kmh and persist for more than 20 minutes{3]fire whirls can uproot trees up to 15 metres (49xc2xa0ft) tall{4] these can also aid the 'spotting' ability of wildfires to propagate and start new fires as they lift burning materials such as tree bark these burning embers can be blown away from the fireground by the stronger winds aloftexamples{edit]another fire whirlan extreme example of a fire tornado is the 1923 great kantxc5x8d earthquake in japan which ignited a large city-sized firestorm and produced a gigantic fire whirl that killed 38000 people in fifteen minutes in the hifukusho-ato region of tokyo{5]another example is the numerous large fire whirls (some tornadic) that developed after lightning struck an oil storage facility near san luis obispo california on 7 april 1926 several of which produced significant structural damage well away from the fire killing two many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe thunderstorms in which the larger fire whirls carried debris 5 kilometers away{6]a fire whirl of reportedly uncommon size for new zealand wildfires formed on day three of the 2017 port hills fires in christchurch pilots estimated the fire column to be 100 metres (330xc2xa0ft) high{7]classification{edit]there are currently three known types of fire whirls:{8]type 1: stable and centered over burning areatype 2: stable or transient downwind of burning areatype 3: steady or transient centered over an open area adjacent to an asymmetric burning area with windthere is evidence suggesting that the fire whirl in the hifukusho-ato area during the great kanto earthquake of 1923 was of type 3{9]references{edit]notes{edit]^ fortofer jason (20 september 2012) "new fire tornado spotted in australia" national geographic^ umscheid michael e;
