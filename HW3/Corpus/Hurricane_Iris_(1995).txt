europepart of the 1995 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane iris was the ninth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season iris was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect the lesser antilles in a three-week period preceding the more destructive hurricanes luis and marilyn it developed from a tropical wave to the east of the lesser antilles on augustxc2xa022 and attained hurricane status within 30xc2xa0hours the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern caribbean from augustxc2xa026 through augustxc2xa028 during that time iris became one of four active tropical storms in the atlantic basin earlier it had interacted with hurricane humberto and beginning on augustxc2xa030 iris interacted with tropical storm karen iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) while moving slowly across the central atlantic the hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating tropical depression karen on septemberxc2xa03 iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on septemberxc2xa04 though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western europe on septemberxc2xa07as a tropical storm iris produced heavy rainfall across much of the leeward islands in the southern lesser antilles high waves caused coastal flooding in trinidad while in martinique further north significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides the threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on montserrat which was being threatened by the eruption of the soufrixc3xa8re hills volcano there were five deaths in association with irisxe2x80x94four in martinique and one in guadeloupecontents1 meteorological history2 preparations and impact3 see also4 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave exited western africa on augustxc2xa016 with a circulation emerging just south of dakar senegal it was the first of four consecutive waves that would later develop into tropical cyclones as the system moved westward thunderstorms diminished on augustxc2xa018 before they gradually redeveloped at around 1200xc2xa0utc the national hurricane center (nhc) classified the system as tropical depression ten about 690xc2xa0mi (1110xc2xa0km) east of the lesser antilles{1] around that time the depression had a well-organized area of convection and evident circulation as confirmed by a nearby ship{2] within six hours of developing the depression had intensified into a tropical storm{1] initially tropical cyclone forecast models had difficulty predicting the future of the storm due to uncertain interaction between it and tropical storm humberto to its northeast{3] in real-time the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm iris at 1500xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa023{4] or about 21xc2xa0hours later than assessed in post-analysis the intensity was based on satellite intensity estimates{1] at that time the storm had a ragged central dense overcastxe2x80x94a uniformly circular area of thunderstormsxe2x80x94as well as rainbands to the north and south{4] a hurricane hunters flight late on augustxc2xa023 indicated that iris was significantly stronger reporting 10xe2x80x93second sustained winds of 106xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh) at flight-level{1] based on the reading it is estimated iris attained hurricane status around 1800xc2xa0utc that day or about three hours after it was named{1]{4]after iris strengthened into a hurricane it turned to the west-southwest due to interaction with hurricane humberto an upper-level low north of puerto rico increased wind shear over the hurricane which dislocated the center from the deep convection as a result iris weakened to tropical storm status on augustxc2xa024 after being a hurricane for about 24xc2xa0hours{1] as the storm approached the lesser antilles the thunderstorms decreased markedly and the cloud pattern became disorganized{5] as late as augustxc2xa025 there was uncertainty whether iris would continue toward the islands or turn to the north{6] a new circulation became the dominant center as the storm continued westward and iris brushed saint lucia early on augustxc2xa026 an approaching trough turned the storm to the northwest bringing it near most of the lesser antilles early on augustxc2xa027 iris weakened to an intensity of 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) although it immediately began restrengthening later that day the center made landfall on montserrat anguilla and barbuda with winds of over 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh){1] by that time an eye began reforming{7] and the structure became better organized as wind shear decreased{8]a satellite image of the atlantic ocean on august 24 including humberto iris jerry and two waves that would ultimately become karen and luison augustxc2xa028 iris moved away from the lesser antilles and at 1800xc2xa0utc re-attained hurricane status as it began a steady motion to the north-northwest{1] by that time there was uncertainty in its future track due to the possible interactions among iris humberto to the northeast tropical storm karen to the southeast and the remnants of tropical storm jerry to the west{9] in addition after tropical storm luis formed on augustxc2xa027 there were four active tropical cyclones in the atlantic{10] a few days later there were three simultaneous hurricanes which is a rare event when luis attained hurricane status{11] on augustxc2xa030 iris turned to the northeast while it began interacting directly with tropical storm karen over the next few days the smaller tropical storm moved around the larger circulation of iris potentially causing the hurricane to move erratically{1] iris' intensity did not change significantly during that time and it maintained strong outflow but a weak eyewall an eastward-moving trough bypassed the storm to the north causing the motion to become nearly stationary{12] a building ridge to the northeast caused iris to turn to a northwest drift on septemberxc2xa01 by that time the eye had become distinct and well-organized{13] and at 0600xc2xa0utc that day iris attained peak winds of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) to the southeast of bermuda{1]after reaching peak intensity the hurricane began weakening due to increasing shear and cooler waters{1] an approaching trough turned iris to the north{14] and early on septemberxc2xa03 the hurricane passed about 350xc2xa0mi (560xc2xa0km) east of bermuda{15] that day iris absorbed the dissipating tropical depression karen{1] it accelerated to the northeast as it lost tropical characteristics and after weakening to a tropical storm iris transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on septemberxc2xa04 to the southeast of newfoundland the remnants turned to the east{1] moving in tandem with an extratropical storm to its north{16] on septemberxc2xa05 the barometric pressure dropped by more than 24 millibars (071xc2xa0inhg) which qualified as being classified as a meteorological bomb{16] the next day the winds strengthened to hurricane-status{1] and the storm maintained a track to the east due to a ridge weakening to the north the pressure reached a minimum of 957xc2xa0mb (283xc2xa0inhg) early on septemberxc2xa07 lower than while iris was tropical{16] that day the storm weakened as it entered the english channel and the extratropical remnants continued across western europe{1]preparations and impact{edit]weather radar image of hurricane iris on augustxc2xa029before iris moved through the lesser antilles tropical storm watches and later warnings were issued from barbados through the british virgin islands the storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern caribbean although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy rainfall{1] flooding prompted evacuations in communities in saint lucia dominica and saint vincent and the grenadines{17] iris was the first of three storms in a three-week period to affect the region preceding the more destructive hurricanes luis and marilyn{18]in western trinidad a feeder produced winds of 37xc2xa0mph (60xc2xa0kmh) along the gulf of paria the winds increased waves that caused coastal flooding and some damage to boats{19] on martinique iris produced gusts of 56xc2xa0mph (90xc2xa0kmh) with torrential rainfall occurring on the island a station in les trois-xc3x8elets recorded 189xc2xa0in (48xc2xa0mm) in a 30xc2xa0minute period and the highest total on the island was 1772xc2xa0in (450xc2xa0mm) at ducos the rains caused mudslides that killed four people{1] including two after a house was swept off a cliff in le vauclin flooding was reported across coastal areas of martinique and heavy damage was reported in the southern city of le vauclin{20] to the north of martinique winds reached 43xc2xa0mph (69xc2xa0kmh) on dominica{1] while the storm passed guadeloupe it produced sustained winds of 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh) on la dxc3xa9sirade{21] there was one death on the island after a person drowned in a storm-flooded river{22] to the northwest the hurricane moved over montserrat{1] causing additional problems on the island just weeks after the soufrixc3xa8re hills volcano began erupting{23] officials on the island closed the primary airport due to the storm which prevented residents from evacuating from the island from the volcano threat{24] further north iris dropped 6xc2xa0in (150xc2xa0mm) of rain on antigua which destroyed banana trees and caused flooding in low-lying areas{1]due to uncertainties in iris' track the government of bermuda issued a tropical storm watch on septemberxc2xa01 this was downgraded on septemberxc2xa03 after the hurricane bypassed the island{1]{25] later after iris became extratropical the storm produced winds of 45xc2xa0mph (72xc2xa0kmh) at la rochelle on the atlantic coast of france{16]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms named irisreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u edward n
