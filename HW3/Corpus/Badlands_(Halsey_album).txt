year-end charts8 certifications9 release history10 referencestitle and music{edit]the name "badlands" is a reference to halsey's state of mind while writing the album to give a physical place as a metaphor for a desolate and lonely mind{3] musically the album is mainly rooted in electropop{4]{5]{6] alternative pop{7] and synth-pop{8] and features industrial undertones{4]production{edit]according to halsey badlands is a concept album that focuses on the fictional dystopian society known as the badlands the city is surrounded by a desert wasteland keeping the inhabitants of the badlands captive{9] the album was inspired by post-apocalyptic movies such as the fifth element after writing the first few songs halsey came to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state halsey states that she created the badlands as an escape from her real life struggles in her opinion the metaphor was that even with no escape there is still optimism that there is somewhere else to go{9] the album was executive produced by lido{10]singles{edit]"ghost" was released as halsey's debut single on october 27 2014 with an accompanying music video filmed in tokyo which was directed by malia james and ryan witt{11] "ghost" was released to radio on april 7 2015{12] halsey announced "new americana" as the second single from the album which was officially released on july 10 2015{13] the official music video for "new americana" came out on september 25 2015{14] "new americana" peaked at number 60 on the billboard hot 100{15]

pitchfork nathan reese wrote "reading interviews with halsey you get the sense of a canny and talented performer one who legitimately wants to connect with fans but the public persona only comes through on badlands in fits and starts and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album" about the chorus on "new americana" he commented "like most of badlands it's calculated defiant and ultimately hollow"{20] in a short review rolling stone's joe levy called halsey a "new popstar with a knack for sticky imagery"{21] the album was included at number six on rock sound's top 50 releases of 2015 list{27]track listing{edit]badlands xe2x80x93 standard edition{28]notitlewriter(s)producer(s)length1"castle"ashley frangipanepeder losnegxc3xa5rdlido4:372"hold me
