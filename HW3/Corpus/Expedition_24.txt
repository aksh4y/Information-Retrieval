module{edit]on 31 july 2010 the expedition 24 crew was awoken by an alarm on the station the alarm was caused by a cooling pump that had failed and caused a remote power controller to trip and cut power to some of the international space station (iss) astronauts tracy caldwell dyson and doug wheelock performed some steps to assist ground controllers in re-powering some of the station components such as two main power buses and one control moment gyroscope after the steps had been completed capcomm james kelly told the crew they could go back to bed as all the work required by the crew on the iss was complete a short time later another alarm sounded and awoke the crew when the ground attempted to restart the pump module{3]docking ring{edit]a failure in the docking ring on the mini-research module 2 (mrm2) poisk caused a delay in the planned landing of the soyuz tma-18 spacecraft soyuz tma-18 was originally planned to undock and land on 24 september 2010 but instead undocked less than 24 hours later on 25 september 2010 the failure is believed to be due to a faulty indication from a micro-switch on the hatch between the soyuz and mrm2 a drive gear which is related to the docking mechanism was also found to have two broken teeth and is believed to be related to the problem as well{4]spacewalks{edit]shannon walker is pictured near the robotic workstation in the destiny

extravehicular mobility units (emus) were originally planned for expedition 24 however additional spacewalking tasks were added to remove and replace a failed ammonia pump

connectors the spacewalkers did not complete all of the planned tasks due to a quick disconnect that got stuck and would not release the pair had to complete a "bake-out" in order to ensure there was no ammonia on their suits before re-entering the space station{5]expedition 24eva 3douglas wheelocktracy caldwell dyson11 august 201012:2711 august 201019:537 hours 26 minuteswheelock successfully closed the quick disconnect valve for the fourth and final fluid connector for the failed pump and detached the final fluid line from the failed pump caldwell dyson demated five electrical and data cables while wheelock broke torque and removed four bolts from the old pump the pump was extracted from the truss through the use of a grapple bar and installed on a payload bracket on the mobile base system on the station's truss caldwell dyson then prepared the spare pump for future installation disconnecting three of five electrical cables and reconfiguring insulation{6]{7]expedition 24eva
