determines the range to a target using pulse-timing techniques and uses the doppler effect of the returned signal to determine the target object's velocity it combines the features of pulse radars and continuous-wave radars which were formerly separate due to the complexity of the electronicspulse-doppler systems were first widely used on fighter aircraft starting in the 1960s earlier radars had used pulse-timing in order to determine range and the angle of the antenna (or similar means) to determine the bearing however this only worked when the radar antenna was not pointed down; in that case the reflection off the ground overwhelmed any returns from other objects as the ground moves at the same speed but opposite direction of the aircraft doppler techniques allow the ground return to be filtered out revealing aircraft and vehicles this gives pulse-doppler radars "look-downshoot-down" capability a secondary advantage in military radar is to reduce the transmitted power while achieving acceptable performance for improved safety of stealthy radar{1]pulse-doppler techniques also find widespread use in meteorological radars allowing the radar to determine wind speed from the velocity of any precipitation in the air pulse-doppler radar is also the basis of synthetic aperture radar used in radar astronomy remote sensing and mapping in air traffic control they are used for discriminating aircraft from clutter besides the above conventional surveillance applications pulse-doppler radar has been successfully applied in healthcare such as fall risk assessment and fall detection for nursing or clinical purposes{2]contents1 history2 principle21 range measurement22 velocity measurement23 benefits24 detriments3 signal processing31 range resolution32 velocity

effects that degrade performance of systems not designed to account for moving objects fast-moving objects cause a phase-shift on the transmit pulse that can produce signal cancellation doppler has maximum detrimental effect on moving target indicator systems which must use reverse phase shift for doppler compensation in the detectordoppler weather effects (precipitation) were also found to degrade conventional radar and moving target indicator radar which can mask aircraft reflections this phenomenon was adapted for use with weather radar in the 1950s after declassification of some world war ii systemspulse-doppler radar was developed during world war ii to overcome limitations by increasing pulse repetition frequency this required the development of the klystron the traveling wave tube and solid state devices pulse-doppler is incompatible with other high power microwave amplification devices that are not coherentearly examples of military systems include the anspg-51b developed during the 1950s specifically for the purpose of operating in hurricane conditions with no performance degradationthe hughes anasg-18 fire control system was a prototype airborne radarcombination system for the planned north american xf-108 rapier interceptor aircraft for the united states air force and later for the lockheed yf-12 the us's first pulse-doppler radar{3] the system had look-downshoot-down capability and could track one target at a timeweather chaff terrain flying techniques and stealth are common tactics used to hide aircraft from radar pulse-doppler radar eliminates these weaknessesit became possible to use pulse-doppler radar on aircraft after digital computers were incorporated in the design pulse-doppler provided look-downshoot-down capability to support air-to-air missile systems in most modern military aircraft by the mid 1970sprinciple{edit]principle of pulse-doppler radarrange measurement{edit]principle of pulsed radarpulse-doppler systems measure the range to objects by measuring the elapsed time between sending a pulse of radio energy and receiving a reflection of the object radio waves travel at the speed of light so the distance to the object is the elapsed time multiplied by the speed of light divided by two - there and backvelocity measurement{edit]change of wavelength caused by motion of the sourcepulse-doppler radar is based on the doppler effect where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the targetdoppler frequency=(2xc3x97transmit frequencyxc3x97range velocityc){displaystyle {ext{doppler frequency}}=left({frac {2imes {ext{transmit frequency}}imes {ext{range velocity}}}{c}}right)}radial velocity is essential for pulse-doppler radar operation as the reflector moves between each transmit pulse the returned signal has a phase difference or phase shift from pulse to pulse this causes the reflector to produce doppler modulation on the reflected signalpulse-doppler radars exploit this phenomenon to improve performancethe amplitude of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume

range motionbenefits{edit]rejection speed is selectable on pulse-doppler aircraft-detection systems so nothing below that speed will be detected a one degree antenna beam illuminates millions of square feet of terrain at 10 miles (16xc2xa0km) range and this produces thousands of detections at or below the horizon if doppler is not usedpulse-doppler radar uses the following signal processing criteria to exclude unwanted signals from slow-moving objects this is also known as clutter rejection{4] rejection velocity is usually set just above the prevailing wind speed (10 to 100 milehour or 15 to 150xc2xa0kmhour) the velocity threshold is much lower for weather radar{5]doppler frequencyxc3x97c2xc3x97transmit  frequency>velocity  threshold{displaystyle leftvert {frac {{ext{doppler

aircraft flight trajectorysurface reflections appear in almost all radar ground clutter generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about 25 miles near ground-based radar this distance extends much further in airborne and space radar clutter results from radio energy being reflected from the earth's surface buildings and vegetation clutter includes weather in radar intended to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft{6]clutter creates a vulnerability region in pulse-amplitude time-domain radar non-doppler radar systems cannot be pointed directly at the ground due to excessive false alarms which overwhelm computers and operators sensitivity must be reduced near clutter to avoid overload this vulnerability begins in the low-elevation region several beam widths above the horizon and extends downward this also exists throughout the volume of moving air associated with weather phenomenonpulse-doppler radar corrects this as followsallows the radar antenna to be pointed directly at the ground without overwhelming the computer and without reducing sensitivityfills in the vulnerability region associated with pulse-amplitude time-domain radar for small object detection near terrain and weatherincreases detection range by 300 or more in comparison to moving target indication (mti) by improving sub-clutter visibility{7]clutter rejection capability of about 60xc2xa0db is needed for look-downshoot-down capability and pulse-doppler is the only strategy that can satisfy this requirement this eliminates vulnerabilities associated with the low-elevation and below-horizon environmentpulse compression and moving target indicator (mti) provide up to 25xc2xa0db sub-clutter visibility mti antenna beam is aimed above horizon to avoid excessive false alarm rate which renders systems vulnerable aircraft and some missiles exploit this weakness using a technique called flying below the radar to avoid detection (nap-of-the-earth) this flying technique is ineffective against pulse-doppler radarpulse-doppler provides an advantage when attempting to detect missiles and low observability aircraft flying near terrain sea surface and weatheraudible doppler and target size support passive vehicle type classification when identification friend or foe is not available from a transponder signal medium pulse repetition frequency (prf) reflected microwave signals fall between 1500 and 15000 cycle per second which is audible this means a helicopter sounds like a helicopter a jet sounds like a jet and propeller aircraft sound like propellers aircraft with no moving parts produce a tone the actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal{citation needed]detriments{edit]maximum range from reflectivity (red) and unambiguous doppler velocity range (blue) with a fix pulse repetition rateambiguity processing is required when target range is above the red line in the graphic which increases scan timescan time is a critical factor for some systems because vehicles moving at or above the speed of sound can travel one mile (16xc2xa0km) every few seconds like the exocet harpoon kitchen and air-to-air missile the maximum time to scan the entire volume of the sky must be on the order of a dozen seconds or less for systems operating in that environmentpulse-doppler radar by itself can be too slow to cover the entire volume of space above the horizon unless fan beam is used this approach is used with the ansps 49(v)5 very long range air surveillance radar which sacrifices elevation measurement to gain speed{8]pulse-doppler antenna motion must be slow enough so that all the return signals from at least 3 different prf can be processed out to the maximum anticipated detection range this is known as dwell time{9] antenna motion for pulse-doppler must be as slow as radar using mtisearch radar that include pulse-doppler are usually dual mode because best overall performance is achieved when pulse-doppler is used for areas with high false alarm rates (horizon or below and weather) while conventional radar will scan faster in free-space where false alarm rate is low (above horizon with clear skies)the antenna type is an important consideration for multi-mode radar because undesirable phase shift introduced by the radar antenna can degrade performance measurements for sub-clutter visibilitysignal processing{edit]the signal processing enhancement of pulse-doppler allows small high-speed objects to be detected in close proximity to large slow moving reflectors to achieve this the transmitter must be coherent and should produce low phase noise during the detection interval and the receiver must have large instantaneous dynamic rangepulse-doppler signal processing detailed

must be satisfied to achieve acceptable performancepulse repetition frequency{edit]main article: pulse repetition frequencypulse-doppler typically uses medium pulse repetition frequency (prf) from about 3xc2xa0khz to 30xc2xa0khz the range between transmit pulses is 5xc2xa0km to 50xc2xa0kmrange and velocity cannot be measured directly using medium prf and ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed doppler signals are generally above 1xc2xa0khz which is audible so audio signals from medium-prf systems can be used for passive target classificationangular measurement{edit]radar systems require angular measurement transponders are not normally associated with pulse-doppler radar so sidelobe suppression is required for practical operation{10]{11]tracking radar systems use angle error to improve accuracy by producing measurements perpendicular to the radar antenna beam angular measurements are averaged over a span of time and combined with radial movement to develop information suitable to predict target position for a short time into the futurethe two angle error techniques used with tracking radar are monopulse and conical scanmonopulse radarconical scanningcoherency{edit]pulse-doppler radar requires a coherent oscillator with very little noise phase noise reduces sub-clutter visibility performance by producing apparent motion on stationary objectscavity magnetron and crossed-field amplifier are not appropriate because noise introduced by these devices interfere with detection performance the only amplification devices suitable for pulse-doppler are klystron traveling wave tube and solid state devicesscalloping{edit]main article: radar scallopingpulse-doppler signal processing introduces a phenomenon called scalloping the name is associated with a series of holes that are scooped-out of the detection performancescalloping for pulse-doppler radar involves blind velocities created by the clutter rejection filter every volume of space must be scanned using 3 or more different prf a two prf detection scheme will have detection gaps with a pattern of discrete ranges each of which has a blind velocitywindowing{edit]ringing artifacts pose a problem with search detection and ambiguity resolution in pulse-doppler radarringing is reduced in two waysfirst the shape of the transmit pulse is adjusted to smooth the leading edge and trailing edge so that rf power is increased and decreased without an abrupt change this creates a transmit pulse with smooth ends instead of a square wave which reduces ringing phenomenon that is otherwise associated with target reflectionsecond the shape of the receive pulse is adjusted using a window function that minimizes ringing that occurs any time pulses are applied to a filter in a digital system this adjusts the phase andor amplitude of each sample before it is applied to the fast fourier transform the dolph-chebyshev window is the most effective because it produces a flat processing floor with no ringing that would otherwise cause false alarms{12]antenna{edit]pulse-doppler radar is generally limited to mechanically aimed antennas and active phase arraymechanical rf components such as wave-guide can produce doppler modulation due to phase shift induced by vibration this introduces a requirement to perform full spectrum operational tests using shake tables that can produce high power mechanical vibration across all anticipated audio frequenciesdoppler is incompatible with most electronically steered phase-array antenna this is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places doppler modulation onto stationary clutter that receive modulation corrupts the measure of performance for sub-clutter visibility phase shifter settling time on the order of 50ns is required start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 phase-shifter settling time-constant (or more) for each 20xc2xa0db of sub-clutter visibilitymost antenna phase shifters operating at prf above 1xc2xa0khz introduce spurious phase shift unless special provisions are made such as reducing phase shifter settling time to a few dozen nanoseconds{13]the following gives the maximum permissible settling time for antenna phase shift modulest=1escv20xc3x97sxc3x97prf{displaystyle t={frac

repetition frequencythe antenna type and scan performance is a practical consideration for multi-mode radar systemsdiffraction{edit]choppy surfaces like waves and trees form a diffraction grating suitable for bending microwave signals pulse-doppler can be so sensitive that diffraction from mountains buildings or wave tops can be used to detect fast moving objects otherwise blocked by solid obstruction along the line of sight this is a very lossy phenomenon that only becomes possible when radar has significant excess sub-clutter visibilityrefraction and ducting use transmit frequency at l-band or lower to extend the horizon which is very different from diffraction refraction for over-the-horizon radar uses variable density in the air column above the surface of the earth to bend rf signals an inversion layer can produce a transient troposphere duct that traps rf signals in a thin layer of air like a wave-guidesubclutter visibility{edit]subclutter visibility involves the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power which is proportional to dynamic range this determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surfacedynamic range=minxe2x81xa1{carrier powernoise

bandwidth (band pass filter)n = noise figurethis equation is derived by combining the radar equation with the noise equation and accounting for in-band noise distribution across multiple detection filters the value d is added to the standard radar range equation to account for both pulse-doppler signal processing and transmitter fm noise reductiondetection range is increased proportional to the fourth root of the number of filters for a given power consumption alternatively power consumption is reduced by the number of filers for a given detection rangepulse-doppler signal processing integrates all of the energy from all of the individual reflected pulses that enter the filter this means a pulse-doppler signal processing system with 1024 elements provides 30103xc2xa0db of

distancethese improvements are the reason pulse-doppler is essential for military and astronomyaircraft tracking uses{edit]pulse-doppler radar for aircraft detection has two modesscantrackscan mode involves frequency filtering amplitude thresholding and ambiguity resolution once a reflection has been detected and resolved the pulse-doppler radar automatically transitions to tracking mode for the volume of space surrounding the tracktrack mode works like a phase-locked loop where doppler velocity is compared with the range movement on successive scans lock indicates the difference between the two measurements is below a threshold which can only occur with an object that satisfies newtonian mechanics other types of electronic signals cannot produce a lock lock exists in no other type of radarthe lock criteria needs to be satisfied during normal operation{14]pulse-doppler signal processing xc2xa7xc2xa0locklock eliminates the need for human intervention with the exception of helicopters and electronic jammingweather phenomenon obey adiabatic process associated with air mass and not newtonian mechanics so the lock criteria is not normally used for weather radarpulse-doppler signal processing selectively excludes low-velocity reflections so that no detections occurs below a threshold velocity this eliminates terrain weather biologicals and mechanical jamming with the exception of decoy aircraftthe target doppler signal from the detection is converted from frequency domain back into time domain sound for the operator in track mode on some radar systems the operator uses this sound for passive target classification such as recognizing helicopters and electronic jamminghelicopters{edit]special consideration is required for aircraft with large moving parts because pulse-doppler radar operates like a phase-locked loop blade tips moving near the speed of sound produce the only signal that can be detected when a helicopter is moving slow near terrain and weatherhelicopters appears like a rapidly pulsing noise emitter except in a clear environment free from clutter an audible signal is produced for passive identification of the type of airborne object microwave doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings (20 xe2x80x93 20000 hz) which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional radar display used for that purpose like a-scope b-scope c-scope and rhi indicator the human ear may be able to tell the difference better than electronic equipmenta special mode is required because the doppler velocity feedback information must be unlinked from radial movement so that the system can transition from scan to track with no locksimilar techniques are required to develop track information for jamming signals and interference that cannot satisfy the lock criteriamulti-mode{edit]pulse-doppler radar must be multi-mode to handle aircraft turning and crossing trajectoryonce in track mode pulse-doppler radar must include a way to modify doppler filtering for the volume of space surrounding a track when radial velocity falls below the minimum detection velocity doppler filter adjustment must be linked with a radar track function to automatically adjust doppler rejection speed within the volume of space surrounding the tracktracking will cease without this feature because the target signal will otherwise be rejected by the doppler filter when radial velocity approaches zeromulti-mode operation may also include continuous wave
