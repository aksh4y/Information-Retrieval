to:navigation searchan australian tropical cyclone is a non frontal low pressure system that has developed within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft in either the southern indian ocean or the south pacific ocean{1] within the southern hemisphere there are officially three areas where tropical cyclones develop on a regular basis these areas are the south-west indian ocean between africa and 90xc2xb0e the australian region between 90xc2xb0e and 160xc2xb0e and the south pacific basin between 160xc2xb0e and 120xc2xb0w the australian region between 90xc2xb0e and 160xc2xb0e is officially monitored by the australian bureau of meteorology the papua new guinea national weather service and the badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika while others like the fiji meteorological service and the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration also monitor the basin each tropical cyclone year within this basin starts on july 1 and runs throughout the year encompassing the tropical cyclone season which runs from november 1 and lasts until april 30 each season within the basin most tropical cyclones have their origins within the south pacific convergence zone or within the northern australian monsoon trough both of which form an extensive area of cloudiness and are dominant features of the season within this region a tropical disturbance is classified as a tropical cyclone when it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65xc2xa0kmh (35xc2xa0mph) that wrap halfway around the low level circulation centre while a severe tropical cyclone is classified when the maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds are greater than 120xc2xa0kmh (75xc2xa0mph)contents1 basin history2 background3 seasons31 1950s32 1960s33 1970s34

clement lindley wragge was the first person to monitor and name them{2]in the early history of tropical cyclones in the australian region the only evidence of a storm was based on ship reports and observations from land later satellite imagery began in the basin in the 195960 season although it was not continuous until 1970 in western australia in particular the lack of population centers shipping lanes radars and offshore stations meant that storms were tracked infrequently after the onset of satellite imagery the dvorak technique was used to estimate storm's intensities and locations{3]background{edit]the australian region is currently defined as being between 90e and 160e and is monitored by five different warning centres during the season that runs from 1 november to 30 april three of the warning centres areseasons{edit]1950s{edit]1960s{edit]seasontropicallowstropicalcyclonessevere
