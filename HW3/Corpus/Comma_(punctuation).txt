mark that appears in several variants in different languages it has the same shape as an apostrophe or single closing quotation mark in many typefaces but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text some typefaces render it as a small line slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical; or with the appearance of a small filled-in figure 9the comma is used in many contexts and languages mainly for separating parts of a sentence such as clauses and items in lists particularly when there are three or more items listed the word comma comes from the greek xcexbaxcfx8cxcexbcxcexbcxcexb1 (kxc3xb3mma) which originally meant a cut-off piece; specifically in grammar a short clause{1]{2]a comma-shaped mark is used as a diacritic in several writing systems and is considered distinct from the cedilla the rough and smooth breathings (xe1xbcx81 xe1xbcx80) appear above the letter in ancient greek and the comma diacritic appears below the letter in latvian

byzantium invented a system of single dots (distinctiones) that separated verses (colometry) and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of text when reading aloud{3] the different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom middle or top of the line for a short passage (a komma) a media distinctio dot was placed mid-level (xc2xa0xc2xb7xc2xa0) this is the origin of the concept of a comma although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separatedthe mark used today is descended from a diagonal slash or virgula suspensiva (xc2xa0xc2xa0) used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause the modern comma was first used by aldus manutius{4]{5]uses in english{edit]in general the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked grammatically to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise the comma performs a number of functions in english writing it is used in generally similar ways in other languages particularly european ones although the rules on comma usage xe2x80x93 and their rigidity xe2x80x93 vary from language to languagein lists{edit]commas are placed between items in lists as in they own a cat a dog two rabbits and seven mice some english style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final conjunction (and or nor) in a list of more than two elements a comma used in such a position is variously called a serial comma an oxford comma or a harvard comma (after the oxford university press and harvard university press both prominent advocates of this style) such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity:the sentence i spoke to the boys sam and tom could mean either i spoke to the boys and sam and tom (i spoke to more than three people) or i spoke to the boys who are sam and tom (i spoke to two people);i spoke to the boys sam and tom xe2x80x93 must be the boys and sam and tom (i spoke to more than three people)the serial comma does not eliminate all confusion consider the following sentence:i thank my mother anne smith and thomas this could mean either my mother and anne smith and thomas (three people) or my mother who is anne smith; and thomas (two people) this sentence might be recast as "my mother (anne smith) and thomas" for clarityi thank my mother anne smith and thomas because the comma after "mother" is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an apposite phrase xe2x80x93 that is a renaming of or further information about a noun xe2x80x93 this construction suggests that my mother's name is "anne smith and thomas" compare "i thank my friend smith and wesson" in which the ambiguity is obviousas a rule of thumb the guardian style guide{6] suggests that straightforward lists (he ate ham eggs and chips) do not need a comma before the final "and" but sometimes it can help the reader (he ate cereal kippers bacon eggs toast and marmalade and tea) the chicago manual of style and other academic writing guides require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the "and" prefacing the last item in a seriesif the individual items of a list are long complex affixed with description or themselves contain commas semicolons may be preferred as separators and the list may be introduced with a colonin news headlines a comma might replace the word "and" even if there are only two items in order to save space as in this headline from reuters:{7]trump macron engage in a little handshake diplomacyseparation of clauses{edit]commas are often used to separate clauses in english a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: after i fed the cat i brushed my clothes (compare this with i brushed my clothes after i fed the cat) a relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive as in i cut down all the trees which were over six feet tall (without the comma this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down)some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for and nor but or yet so) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction{8]{9] in the following sentences where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence) the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:mary walked to the party but she was unable to walk homedesigner clothes are silly and i can't afford them anywaydon't push that button or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!in the following sentences where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause (because it does not contain an explicit subject) those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:mary walked to the party but was unable to walk homei think designer clothes are silly and can't afford them anywayhowever such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short typically when the second independent clause is an imperative{8]{9] as in:sit down and shut upthe above guidance is not universally accepted or applied long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas:{10]she had very little to live on but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hersin some languages such as german and polish stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses with dependent clauses always being set off with commas and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctionsthe joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in "it is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark") is known as a comma splice and is sometimes considered an error in english;{11] in most cases a semicolon should be used instead a comma splice should not be confused though with asyndeton a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omittedcertain adverbs{edit]commas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence including however in fact therefore nevertheless moreover furthermore and stilltherefore a comma would be appropriate in this sentencenevertheless i will not use oneif these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence they are followed and preceded by a comma as in the second of the two below examples if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a commain this sentence furthermore commas would also be called forthis sentence is similar; however a semicolon is necessary as wellusing commas to offset certain adverbs is optional including then so yet instead and too (meaning also)so that's it for this rule orso that's it for this rulea comma would be appropriate in this sentence too ora comma would be appropriate in this sentence tooparenthetical phrases{edit] commas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence (ie information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence) such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence the following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:introductory phrase: once upon a time my father ate a muffin{12]interjection: my father ate the muffin gosh darn it!aside: my father if you don't mind me telling you this ate the muffinappositive: my father a jaded and bitter man ate the muffinabsolute phrase: my father his eyes flashing with rage ate the muffinfree modifier: my father chewing with unbridled fury ate the muffinresumptive modifier: my father ate the muffin a muffin which no man had yet chewedsummative modifier: my father ate the muffin a feat which no man had attemptedbetween adjectives{edit]a comma is used to separate coordinate adjectives (ie adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun) adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if and were placed between them for example:the dull incessant droning but the cute little cottagethe devious lazy red frog suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious) while the devious lazy red frog does not carry this connotationbefore quotations{edit]some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma as in mr kershner says "you should know how to use a comma" quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a commaother writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway thus they would write mr kershner says "you should know how to use a comma"in dates{edit]month day year{edit]when a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year a comma separates the day from the year: december 19 1941 this style is common in american english the comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: december 19xc2xa01941 most style manuals including the chicago manual of style{13] and the ap stylebook{14] also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after it: "feb 14 1987 was the target date"if just month and year are given no commas are used:{15] "her daughter april may return in june 2009 for the reunion"day month year{edit]when the day precedes the month the month name separates the numeric day and year so commas are not necessary to separate them: "the raid on alexandria was carried out on 19xc2xa0decemberxc2xa01941"in geographical names{edit]commas are used to separate parts of geographical references such as city and state (dallas texas) or city and country (kampala uganda) additionally most style manuals including the chicago manual of style{16] and the ap stylebook{17] recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after: "the plane landed in kampala uganda that evening"{18]the united states postal service{19] and royal mail{20] recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages as the marks hinder optical character recognitionin numbers{edit]main article: decimal markin representing large numbers from the right side to the left english texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal this is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself however in much of europe southern africa and latin america periods or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator equivalent to the use in english of the decimal point in india the groups are two digits except for the rightmost group in some styles the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (eg in the si writing style{21]); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits insteadin names{edit]commas are used when writing names that are presented surname first generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: smith john they are also used before many titles that follow a name: john smith phd"the big final rule for the comma is one that you won't find in any books by grammariansxc2xa0 don't use commas like a stupid person"xc2xa0lynne truss eats shoots and leaves{22]similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: ; socks green: 3 pairs; socks red: 2 pairs; tie regimental: 1ellipsis{edit]commas may be used to indicate that a word or a group of words has been omitted{23] as in the cat was white; the dog brown (here the comma replaces was)vocative{edit]commas are placed before after or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person place or thing:i hope john that you will read thisbetween the subject and predicate{edit]in his 1785 essay on punctuation joseph robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however this usage is regarded as an error in modern timesthe good taste of the present age has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the english languagewhoever is capable of forgetting a benefit is an enemy to societydifferences between american and british usage{edit]the comma and the quotation mark pairing can be used in several ways in american english the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:{24]{25]my mother gave me the nickname "bobby bobby bob bob boy" which really made me angryin great britain and many other parts of the world punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:{24]{25]{26]my mother gave me the nickname "bobby bobby bob bob boy" which really made me angrythere is also some difference regarding the use of the serial comma which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items:they served apples peaches and bananas (serial comma used)we cleaned up cores pits and skins (serial comma omitted)the serial comma is also known as the oxford comma harvard comma or series comma it is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an americanism{citation needed] but its usage occurs within both american and british english it is called the oxford comma because of its long history of use by oxford university press{27]opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma a majority of american style guides mandate use of the serial comma including the chicago manual of style strunk and white's the elements of style and the us government printing office style manual the ap stylebook for journalistic writing advises against it it is used less often in british english but some british style guides require it including the oxford university press style manual and fowler's modern english usage some writers of british english use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguityaccording to new hart's rules "house style will dictate" whether to use the serial comma and "the general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently" no association with region or dialect is suggested other than that its use has been strongly advocated by oxford university press{28]barbara child advises that "it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series" but claims that in the united states there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally{29] this is reinforced by an article by robert j samuelson in newsweek{30] lynne truss says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the uk where it has been a slow steady trend for at least a century:nowadaysxc2xa0 a passage peppered with commasxe2x80x94which in the past would have indicated painstaking and authoritative editorial attentionxe2x80x94smacks simply of no backbone people who put in all the commas betray themselves as moral weaklings with empty lives and out-of-date reference books (truss 2004 pp 97xe2x80x9398)in his 1963 book of spies and stratagems stanley p lovell recalls that during the second world war the british carried the comma over into abbreviations specifically "special operations executive" was written "soe" nowadays even the full stops are frequently discardedin other languages{edit]punctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it including a number of different comma forms european languages like german french italian spanish and portuguese use the same comma as english with similar spacing though usage may be somewhat different for instance in standard german subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas modern greek uses the same unicode comma for its kxc3xb3mma (xcexbaxcfx8cxcexbcxcexbcxcexb1){31] and it is officially romanized as a latin comma{32] but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former hypodiastole a curved interpunct used to disambiguate certain homonyms the comma therefore functions as a silent letter in a handful of greek words principally distinguishing xcfx8cxcfx84xcexb9 (xc3xb3ti "whatever") from xcfx8cxcfx84xcexb9 (xc3xb3ti "that"){31]the enumeration or ideographic commaxe2x80x94u+3001 xe3x80x81 ideographic commaxe2x80x94is used in chinese japanese punctuation and somewhat in korean punctuation in the people's republic of china and in northsouth korea this comma (txc2xa0xe9xa0x93xe8x99x9f sxc2xa0xe9xa1xbfxe5x8fxb7 pxe2x80x89dxc3xb9nhxc3xa0o) is usually used only to separate items in lists while in japan it is the more common form of comma (xe8xaaxadxe7x82xb9 rxc2xa0txc5x8dten litxc2xa0"reading mark") in documents that mix japanese and latin scripts the full-width comma (u+ff0c xefxbcx8c fullwidth comma) is used; this is the standard form of comma (txc2xa0xe9x80x97xe8x99x9f sxc2xa0xe9x80x97xe5x8fxb7 pxe2x80x89dxc3xb2uhxc3xa0o) in china since east asian typography permits commas to join clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought commas may separate subjects and predicates and constructions that would be considered a "comma splice" in english are acceptable and commonly encounteredkorean punctuation uses both commas and interpuncts for liststhe comma in the arabic script (used by arabic urdu and persian etc) is inverted upside-down: 'xd8x8c' (u+060c xd8x8c arabic comma) in order to distinguish it from the arabic diacritic xe1xb8x8dammah (xd9x8f ) representing the vowel u which is similarly comma-shaped{33] in arabic texts western-styled comma (xd9xab) is used as a decimal pointreversed comma (u+2e41 xe2xb9x81 reversed comma) is used in sindhi when written in arabic script it is different from the standard arabic commahebrew script is also written from right to left however hebrew punctuation includes only a regular comma ()dravidian languages such as tamil telugu kannada and malayalam also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of european languages with similar spacing{34]computing{edit]in the common character encoding systems unicode and ascii character 44 (0x2c) corresponds to the comma symbol the html numeric character reference is 44;in many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a function to separate elements in a list and to perform data designation on multiple variables at oncein the c programming language the comma symbol is an operator which evaluates its first argument (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument this is useful in for statements and macrosin smalltalk the comma operator is used to concatenate collections including stringsin prolog the comma is used to denote logical conjunction ("and")the comma-separated values (csv) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formatsdiacritical usage{edit]main articles: d-comma s-comma and t-commathe comma is used as a diacritic mark in romanian under the s (xc8x98 xc8x99) and under the t (xc8x9a xc8x9b) a cedilla is occasionally used instead of it (notably in the unicode glyph names) but this is technically incorrect the symbol dxccxa6 (d with comma below) was used as part of the romanian transitional alphabet (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the latin letter z or letters dz where derived from a cyrillic xd1x95 (dz) the comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive z (xcax92) placed below the letter from this standpoint alone xc8x99 xc8x9b and dxccxa6 could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for sz tz and dz respectivelyin latvian the comma is used on the letters xc4xa3 xc4xb7 xc4xbc xc5x86 and historically also xc5x97 to indicate palatalization because the lowercase letter g has a descender the comma is rotated 180xc2xb0 and placed over the letter although their adobe glyph names are commas their names in the unicode standard are g k l n and r with a cedilla they were introduced to the unicode standard before 1992 and their name cannot be alteredin czech and slovak the diacritic in the characters xc4x8f xc5xa5 and xc4xbe resembles a superscript comma but it is used instead of a caron because the letter has an ascender other ascender letters with carons such as letters xc8x9f (used in finnish romani and lakota) and xc7xa9 (used in skolt sami) did not modify their carons to superscript commasin 16th-century guatemala the archaic letter cuatrillo with a comma (xeax9cxae xeax9cxaf) was used to write mayan languages{35]digits with commas (xf0x9fx84x81 xf0x9fx84x82 xf0x9fx84x83 xf0x9fx84x84 xf0x9fx84x85 xf0x9fx84x86
