its first component launched into orbit in 1998 and the iss is now the largest human-made body in low earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from earth{8]{9] the iss consists of pressurised modules external trusses solar arrays and other components iss components have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and american space shuttles{10]the iss serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology human biology physics astronomy meteorology and other fields{11]{12]{13] the station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the moon and mars{14] the iss maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435xc2xa0km (205 and 270xc2xa0mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the zvezda module or visiting spacecraft it completes 1554xc2xa0orbits per day{15]the iss is the ninth space station to be inhabited by crews following the soviet and later russian salyut almaz and mir stations as well as skylab from the us the station has been continuously occupied for 7003621900000000000xe2x99xa017xc2xa0years and 10xc2xa0days since the arrival of expedition 1 on 2 november 2000 this is the longest continuous human presence in low earth orbit having surpassed the previous record of 7003364400000000000xe2x99xa09xc2xa0years and 357xc2xa0days held by mir the station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft: the russian soyuz and progress the american dragon and cygnus the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle{16] and formerly the space shuttle and the european automated transfer vehicle it has been visited by astronauts cosmonauts and space tourists from 17 different nations{17]after the us space shuttle programme ended in 2011 soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the international space station and dragon became the only provider of bulk cargo return to earth (called downmass) soyuz has very limited downmass capabilitythe iss programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: nasa roscosmos jaxa esa and csa{16]{18] the ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements{19] the station is divided into two sections the russian orbital segment (ros) and the united states orbital segment (usos) which is shared by many nations as of january 2014{update] the american portion of iss is being funded until 2024{20]{21]{22] roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of iss through 2024{23] but has proposed using elements of the russian orbital segment to construct a new russian space station called opsek{24]on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss{25]{26] nasa later issued a guarded statement expressing thanks for russia's interest in future co-operation in space exploration but fell short of confirming the russian announcement{27]{28]contents1 purpose11 scientific research111 microgravity12 exploration13 education and

attached to the end of the japanese robotic armaccording to the original memorandum of understanding between nasa and rosaviakosmos the international space station was intended to be a laboratory observatory and factory in low earth orbit it was also planned to provide transportation maintenance and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the moon mars and asteroids{29] in the 2010 united states national space policy the iss was given additional roles of serving commercial diplomatic{30] and educational purposes{31]scientific researchmain article: scientific research on the issthe iss provides a platform to conduct scientific research small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft{17]{32]the iss simplifies individual experiments by eliminating the need for separate rocket launches and research staff the wide variety of research fields include astrobiology astronomy human research including space medicine and life sciences physical sciences materials science space weather and weather on earth (meteorology){11]{12]{13]{33]{34] scientists on earth have access to the crew's data and can modify experiments or launch new ones which are benefits generally unavailable on unmanned spacecraft{32] crews fly expeditions of several months duration providing approximately 160-man-hours per week of labour with a crew of 6{11]{35]to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe engineers and scientists from all over the world built the alpha magnetic spectrometer (ams) which nasa compares to the hubble space telescope and says could not be accommodated on a free flying satellite platform partly because of its power requirements and data bandwidth needs{36]{37] on 3 april 2013 nasa scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the alpha magnetic spectrometer{38]{39]{40]{41]{42]{43] according to the scientists "the first results from the space-borne alpha magnetic spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in earth-bound cosmic rays"comet lovejoy photographed by expedition 30 commander dan burbankexpedition 8 commander and science officer michael foale conducts an inspection of the microgravity science gloveboxthe space environment is hostile to life unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind in addition to cosmic rays) high vacuum extreme temperatures and microgravity{44] some simple forms of life called extremophiles{45] including small invertebrates called tardigrades{46] can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state called desiccationmedical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body including muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift this data will be used to determine whether lengthy human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible as of 2006{update] data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the six-month interval required to travel to mars{47]{48] medical studies are conducted aboard the iss on behalf of the national space biomedical research institute (nsbri) prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts the study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space usually there is no physician on board the iss and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge it is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult{49]{50]{51]microgravitya comparison between the combustion of a candle on earth (left) and in a microgravity environment such as that found on the iss (right)the earth's gravity is only slightly weaker at the altitude of the iss than at the surface but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness this perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five separate effects:{52]drag from the residual atmosphere; when the iss enters the earth's shadow the main solar panels are rotated to minimise this aerodynamic drag helping reduce orbital decayvibration from movements of mechanical systems and the crewactuation of the on-board attitude control moment gyroscopesthruster firings for attitude or orbital changesgravity-gradient effects also known as tidal effects items at different locations within the iss would if not attached to the station follow slightly different orbits being mechanically interconnected these items experience small forces that keep the station moving as a rigid bodyiss crew member storing samplesresearchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals in response to some of this data nasa wants to investigate microgravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional human-like tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space{12]investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on earth in addition examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity{12]the study of materials science is an important iss research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground{53] other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants these findings may improve current knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits future plans are for the researchers aboard the iss to examine aerosols ozone water vapour and oxides in earth's atmosphere as well as cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe{12]explorationa 3d plan of the russia-based mars-500 complex used for ground-based experiments which complement iss-based preparations for a human mission to marsthe iss provides a location in the relative safety of low earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the moon and mars this provides experience in operations maintenance as well as repair and replacement activities on-orbit which will be essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from earth mission risks can be reduced and the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft advanced{14] referring to the mars-500 experiment esa states that "whereas the iss is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness radiation and other space-specific factors aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations"{54] sergey krasnov the head of human space flight programmes for russia's space agency roscosmos in 2011 suggested a "shorter version" of mars-500 may be carried out on the iss{55]in 2009 noting the value of the partnership framework itself sergey krasnov wrote "when compared with partners acting separately partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration the iss is helping further advance near-earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the solar system including the moon and mars"{56] a manned mission to mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current iss partnership in 2010 esa director-general jean-jacques dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that china india and south korea be invited to join the iss partnership{57] nasa chief charlie bolden stated in february 2011 "any mission to mars is likely to be a global effort"{58] currently american legislation prevents nasa co-operation with china on space projects{59]education and cultural outreachjapan's kounotori 4 berthingthe iss crew provides opportunities for students on earth by running student-developed experiments making educational demonstrations allowing for student participation in classroom versions of iss experiments and directly engaging students using radio videolink and email{16]{60] esa offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms{61] in one lesson students can navigate a 3-d model of the interior and exterior of the iss and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time{62]jaxa aims both to "stimulate the curiosity of children cultivating their spirits and encouraging their passion to pursue craftsmanship" and to "heighten the child's awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society"{63] through a series of education guides a deeper understanding of the past and near-term future of manned space flight as well as that of earth and life will be learned{64]{65] in the jaxa seeds in space experiments the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the iss is explored students grow sunflower seeds which flew on the iss for about nine months as a start to 'touch the universe' in the first phase of kibxc5x8d utilisation from 2008 to mid-2010 researchers from more than a dozen japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields{66]original jules verne manuscripts displayed by crew inside jules verne atvcultural activities are another major objective tetsuo tanaka director of jaxa's space environment and utilization center says "there is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science"{67]amateur radio on the iss (ariss) is a volunteer programme which encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science technology engineering and mathematics through amateur radio communications opportunities with the iss crew ariss is an international working group consisting of delegations from nine countries including several countries in europe as well as japan russia canada and the united states in areas where radio equipment cannot be used speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the station{68]first orbit is a feature-length documentary film about vostok 1 the first manned space flight around the earth by matching the orbit of the international space station to that of vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground path and time of day documentary filmmaker christopher riley and esa astronaut paolo nespoli were able to film the view that yuri gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight this new footage was cut together with the original vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the russian state archive nespoli during expedition 2627 filmed the majority of the footage for this documentary film and as a result is credited as its director of photography{69] the film was streamed through the website firstorbitorg in a global youtube premiere in 2011 under a free license{70]in may 2013 commander chris hadfield shot a music video of david bowie's "space oddity" on board the station; the film was released freely on youtube{71] it was the first music video ever to be filmed in space{72]assemblymain articles: assembly of the international space station and list

solar arrays installedcupola arrived in 2010the assembly of the international space station a major endeavour in space architecture began in november 1998{5] russian modules launched and docked robotically with the exception of rassvet all other modules were delivered by the space shuttle which required installation by iss and shuttle crewmembers using the canadarm2 (ssrms) and extra-vehicular activities (evas); as of 5 june 2011{update] they had added 159 components during more than 1000 hours of eva (see list of iss spacewalks) 127 of these spacewalks originated from the station and the remaining 32 were launched from the airlocks of docked space shuttles{4] the beta angle of the station had to be considered at all times during construction as it directly affects how long during its orbit the station (and any docked or docking spacecraft) is exposed to the sun; the space shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the "beta cutoff"{73] many of the modules that launched on the space shuttle were integrated and tested on the ground at the space station processing facility to find and correct issues prior to launchthe first module of the iss zarya was launched on 20 november 1998 on an autonomous russian proton rocket it provided propulsion attitude control communications electrical power but lacked long-term life support functions two weeks later a passive nasa module unity was launched aboard space shuttle flight sts-88 and attached to zarya by astronauts during evas this module has two pressurized mating adapters (pmas) one connects permanently to zarya the other allows the space shuttle to dock to the space station at that time the russian station mir was still inhabited the iss remained unmanned for two years while mir was de-orbited on 12 july 2000 zvezda was launched into orbit preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna it then became the passive target for a rendezvous with zarya and unity: it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the zarya-unity vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the russian automated rendezvous and docking system zarya's computer transferred control of the station to zvezda's computer soon after docking zvezda added sleeping quarters a toilet kitchen co2 scrubbers dehumidifier oxygen generators exercise equipment plus data voice and television communications with mission control this enabled permanent habitation of the station{74]{75]the first resident crew expedition 1 arrived in november 2000 on soyuz tm-31 at the end of the first day on the station astronaut bill shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign "alpha" which he and cosmonaut krikalev preferred to the more cumbersome "international space station"{76] the name "alpha" had previously been used for the station in the early 1990s{77] and following the request its use was authorised for the whole of expedition 1{78] shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said: "for thousands of years humans have been going to sea in ships people have designed and built these vessels launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage"{79] yuri semenov the president of russian space corporation energia at the time disapproved of the name "alpha"; he felt that mir was the first space station and so he would have preferred the names "beta" or "mirxc2xa02" for the iss{78]{80]{81]expedition 1 arrived midway between the flights of sts-92 and sts-97 these two space shuttle flights each added segments of the station's integrated truss structure which provided the station with ku-band communication for us television additional attitude support needed for the additional mass of the usos and substantial solar arrays supplementing the station's existing 4 solar arrays{82]over the next two years the station continued to expand a soyuz-u rocket delivered the pirs docking compartment the space shuttles discovery atlantis and endeavour delivered the destiny laboratory and quest airlock in addition to the station's main robot arm the canadarm2 and several more segments of the integrated truss structurethe expansion schedule was interrupted by the space shuttle columbia disaster in 2003 and a resulting two-year hiatus in the space shuttle programme the space shuttle was grounded until 2005 with sts-114 flown by discovery{83]assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of sts-115 with atlantis which delivered the station's second set of solar arrays several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on sts-116 sts-117 and sts-118 as a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities more pressurised modules could be accommodated and the harmony node and columbus european laboratory were added these were soon followed by the first two components of kibxc5x8d in march 2009 sts-119 completed the integrated truss structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays the final section of kibxc5x8d was delivered in july 2009 on sts-127 followed by the russian poisk module the third node tranquility was delivered in february 2010 during sts-130 by the space shuttle endeavour alongside the cupola followed in may 2010 by the penultimate russian module rassvet rassvet was delivered by space shuttle atlantis on sts-132 in exchange for the russian proton delivery of the zarya module in 1998 which had been funded by the united states{84] the last pressurised module of the usos leonardo was brought to the station by discovery on her final flight sts-133{85] followed by the alpha magnetic spectrometer on sts-134 delivered by endeavour{86]as of june 2011{update] the station consisted of 15 pressurised modules and the integrated truss structure five modules are still to be launched including the nauka with the european robotic arm the uzlovoy module and two power modules called nem-1 and nem-2{87] as of august 2017{update] russia's future primary research module nauka is set to launch in the first quarter of 2018 along with the european robotic arm which will be able to relocate itself to different parts of the russian modules of the station after the nauka module is attached the uzlovoy module will be attached to one of its docking ports when completed the station will have a mass of more than 400 tonnes (440 short tons){5]the gross mass of the station changes over time the total launch mass of the modules on orbit is about 417289xc2xa0kg (919965xc2xa0lb) (as of 3 september 2011){88] the mass of experiments spare parts personal

assembly with the launch and assembly in orbit of other modules with more specialised functionality zarya is now primarily used for storage both inside the pressurised section and in the externally mounted fuel tanks zarya is a descendant of the tks spacecraft designed for the soviet salyut programme the name zarya was given to the fgb because it signified the dawn of a new era of international co-operation in space although it was built by a russian company it is owned by the united states zarya weighs 19300xc2xa0kg (42500xc2xa0lb) is 1255xc2xa0m (412xc2xa0ft) long and 41xc2xa0m

(250xc2xa0mi) high orbit with a designed lifetime of at least 15 years after zarya reached orbit sts-88 launched on 4 december 1998 to attach the unity modulealthough only designed to fly autonomously for six to eight months zarya did so for almost two years because of delays with the russian service module zvezda which finally launched on 12 july 2000 and docked with zarya on 26 july using the russian kurs docking systemunityunity as pictured by space shuttle endeavourunity or node 1 is one of three nodes or passive connecting modules in the us orbital segment of the station it was the first us-built component of the station to be launched the module is made of aluminium and cylindrical in shape with six berthing locations facilitating connections to other modules essential space station resources such as fluids environmental control and life support systems electrical and data systems are routed through unity to supply work and living areas of the station more than 50000 mechanical items 216 lines to carry fluids and gases and 121 internal and external electrical cables using six miles of wire were installed in the unity node prior to its launch conical pressurized mating adapters (pmas) were attached to the aft and forward berthing mechanisms of unity unity and the two mating adapters together weighed about 11600xc2xa0kg (25600xc2xa0lb) the adapters allow the

voltage; the two station segments share power with convertersthe usos solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts{169] these arrays normally track the sun to maximise power generation each array is about 375xc2xa0m2 (4036xc2xa0sqxc2xa0ft) in area and 58xc2xa0m (190xc2xa0ft) long in the complete configuration the solar arrays track the sun by rotating the alpha gimbal once per orbit; the beta gimbal follows slower changes in the angle of the sun to the orbital plane the night glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude{170]the station uses rechargeable nickelxe2x80x93hydrogen batteries (nih2) for continuous power during the 35 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the earth the batteries are recharged on the day side of the earth they have a 65-year lifetime (over 37000 chargedischarge cycles) and will be regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station{171] as of 2017 the nickelxe2x80x93hydrogen batteries are being replaced by lithium-ion batteries which are expected to last until the end of the iss program{172]the station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere this could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath to mitigate this plasma contactor units (pcu)s create current paths between the station and the ambient plasma field{173]iss external active thermal control system (eatcs) diagramthe station's systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power almost all of which converts to heat little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station to keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable workable limits ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation then back into the station{174] thus this passive thermal control system (ptcs) is made of external surface materials insulation such as mli and heat pipesif the ptcs cannot keep up with the heat load an external active thermal control system (eatcs) maintains the temperature the eatcs consists of an internal non-toxic water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat the eatcs provides cooling for all the us pressurised modules including kibxc5x8d and columbus as well as the main power distribution electronics of the s0 s1 and p1 trusses it can reject up to 70xc2xa0kw this is much more than the 14xc2xa0kw of the early external active thermal control system (eeatcs) via the early ammonia servicer (eas) which was launched on

is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes{176]the russian orbital segment communicates directly with the ground via the lira antenna mounted to zvezda{16]{177] the lira antenna also has the capability to use the luch data relay satellite system{16] this system used for communications with mir fell into disrepair during the 1990s and so is no longer in use{16]{178]{179] although two new luch satellitesxe2x80x94luch-5a and luch-5bxe2x80x94were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system{180] another russian communications system is the voskhod-m which enables internal telephone communications between zvezda zarya pirs poisk and the usos and also provides a vhf radio link to ground control centres via antennas on zvezda's exterior{181]the us orbital segment (usos) makes use of two separate radio links mounted in the z1 truss structure: the s band (used for audio) and ku band (used for audio video and data) systems these transmissions are routed via the united states tracking and data relay satellite system (tdrss) in geostationary orbit which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with nasa's mission control center (mcc-h) in houston{10]{16]{176] data channels for the canadarm2 european columbus laboratory and japanese kibxc5x8d modules are routed via the s band

altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each nasa shuttle mission orbital boost burns would generally be delayed until after the shuttle's departure this allowed shuttle payloads to be lifted with the station's engines during the routine firings rather than have the shuttle lift itself and the payload together to a higher orbit this trade-off allowed heavier loads to be transferred to the station after the retirement of the nasa shuttle the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude{208]{209] other more frequent supply ships do not require this adjustment as they are substantially lighter vehicles{32]{210]orbits of the iss shown in april 2013orbital boosting can be performed by the station's two main engines on the zvezda service module or russian or european spacecraft docked to zvezda's aft port the atv has been designed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its other end allowing it to remain at the iss and still allow other craft to dock and boost the station it takes approximately two orbits (three hours) for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed{210] maintaining iss altitude uses about 75 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum{211] at an annual cost of about 210 million{212]in december 2008 nasa signed an agreement with the ad astra rocket company which may result in the testing on the iss of a vasimr plasma propulsion engine{213] this technology could allow station-keeping to be done more economically than at present{214]{215]the russian orbital segment contains the data management system which handles guidance navigation and control (ros gnc) for the entire station{95] initially zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the russian service module zvezda docked and was transferred control zvezda contains the esa built dms-r data management system{216] using two fault-tolerant computers (ftc) zvezda computes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant earth horizon sensors solar horizon sensors as well as sun and star trackers the ftcs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority votingorientationzvezda uses gyroscopes and thrusters to turn itself around gyroscopes do not require propellant rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement the usos has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section when gyroscopes 'saturate' thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum during expedition 10 an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed when attitude control computers in the ros and usos fail to communicate properly it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ros gnc computer must ignore the usos counterpart which has no

repairs to a us solar array which damaged itself when unfoldingmike hopkins on his christmas eve spacewalkunexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and in some cases could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons had these problems not been resolved during sts-120 in 2007 following the relocation of the p6 truss and solar arrays it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly{221] an eva was carried out by scott parazynski assisted by douglas wheelock the men took extra precautions to reduce the risk of electric shock as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight{222] the issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard solar alpha rotary joint (sarj) which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard sarj until the cause was understood inspections during evas on sts-120 and sts-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage{223] repairs to the joint were carried out during sts-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint{224]{225]2009 saw damage to the s1 radiator one of the components of the station's cooling system the problem was first noticed in soyuz imagery in september 2008 but was not thought to be serious{226] the imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel has peeled back from the underlying central structure possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact it is also known that a service module thruster cover jettisoned during an eva in 2008 had struck the s1 radiator but its effect if any has not been determined on 15 may 2009 the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve the same valve was used immediately afterwards to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak from the cooling system via the damaged panel{226]early on 1 august 2010 a failure in cooling loop a (starboard side) one of two external cooling loops left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems{227]{228]{229] the problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid several subsystems including two of the four cmgs were shut downplanned operations on the iss were interrupted through a series of evas to address the cooling system issue a first eva on 7 august 2010 to replace the failed pump module was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects a second eva on 11 august successfully removed the failed pump module{230]{231] a third eva was required to restore loop a to normal functionality{232]{233]the usos's cooling system is largely built by the american company boeing{234] which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump{235]an air leak from the usos in 2004{236] the venting of fumes from an elektron oxygen generator in 2006{237] and the failure of the computers in the ros in 2007 during sts-117 left the station without thruster elektron vozdukh and other environmental control system operations the root cause of which was found to be condensation inside the electrical connectors leading to a short-circuit{citation needed]the four main bus switching units (mbsus located in the s0 truss) control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the iss in late 2011 mbsu-1 while still routing power correctly ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available eva in each mbsu two power channels feed 160v dc from the arrays to two dc-to-dc power converters (ddcus) that supply the 124v power used in the station a spare mbsu was already on board but 30 august 2012 eva failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured{238] the loss of mbsu-1 limits the station to 75 of its normal power capacity requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressedon 5 september 2012 in a second 6xc2xa0hr eva to replace mbsu-1 astronauts sunita williams and akihiko hoshide successfully restored the iss to 100 power{239]on 24 december 2013 astronauts made a rare christmas eve space walk installing a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system the

american manual approach to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity the downside to this mode of operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning making the process more labour-intensive and expensive the russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles although the initial development costs were high the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations{254] an automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrivalsoyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation also serve as lifeboats for emergency evacuation; they are replaced every six months and have been used once to remove excess crew after the columbia disaster{255] expeditions require on average 2722xc2xa0kg of supplies and as of 9 march 2011{update] crews had consumed a total of around 22000 meals{4] soyuz crew rotation flights and progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year{256] with the atv and htv planned to visit annually from 2010 onwards{citation needed] cygnus and dragon were contracted to fly cargo to the station after retirement of the nasa shuttle{257]{258]from 26 february 2011 to 7 march 2011 four of the governmental

attitude control (gnc) is handed over to the ground control of the ships' country of origin gnc is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes the solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells when a nasa space shuttle docked to the station other ships were grounded as the shuttle's reinforced carbon-carbon wing leading edges cameras windows and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships' movementsapproximately 30 of nasa shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather occasional priority was given to the soyuz arrivals at the station where the soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials also causing shuttle delays departure of the nasa shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites{261] whilst the soyuz is capable of landing anywhere anytime its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions soyuz launches occur in adverse weather conditions but the cosmodrome has been shut down on occasions when buried by snow drifts up to 6 metres in depth hampering ground operationslife aboardcrew activitiescrewmember peers out of a windowa typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06:00 followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station the crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with mission control before starting work at around 08:10 the first scheduled exercise of the day follows after which the crew continues work until 13:05 following a one-hour lunch break the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30 including dinner and a crew conference the scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30 in general the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday and five hours on saturdays with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up{262]the time zone used aboard the iss is coordinated universal time (utc) the windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day during visiting space shuttle missions the iss crew mostly follows the shuttle's mission elapsed time (met) which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission{263]{264]{265]the station provides crew quarters for each member of the expedition's crew with two 'sleep stations' in the zvezda and four more installed in harmony{266]{267] the american quarters are private approximately person-sized soundproof booths the russian crew quarters include a small window but provide less ventilation and sound proofing a crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag listen to music use a laptop and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls the module also provides a reading lamp a shelf and a desktop{268]{269]{270] visiting crews have no allocated sleep module and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall it is possible to sleep floating freely through the station but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment{271] it is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads{268]see also: christmas on the international space stationfoodthe crews of sts-127 and expedition 20 enjoy a meal inside unitysee also: space foodmost of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity{268] therefore effort is made to make the food more palatable such as using more spices than in regular cooking the crew looks forward to the arrival of any ships from earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables care is taken that foods do not create crumbs sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley the galley features two food warmers a refrigerator added in november 2008 and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water{269] drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption{269]{270] drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away any food that floats away including crumbs must be collected to prevent it from

crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water{271]{274]there are two space toilets on the iss both of russian design located in zvezda and tranquility{269] these waste and hygiene compartments use a fan-driven suction system similar to the space shuttle waste collection system astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal{268] a lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open: the air stream carries the waste away solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container full containers are transferred to progress spacecraft for disposal{269]{275] liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically correct "urine funnel adapters" attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet the diverted urine is collected and transferred to the water recovery system where it is recycled into drinking water{270]crew health and safetymain article: effect

on solar activity the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around earth and iss solar flares are still a hazard to the crew who may receive only a few minutes warning in 2005 during the initial 'proton storm' of an x-3 class solar flare the crew of expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ros designed for this purpose{276]{277]play mediavideo of the aurora australis

solar wind are normally absorbed by earth's atmosphere when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora outside earth's atmosphere crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day which is about a year of natural exposure on earth this results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the dna and chromosomes of lymphocytes these cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level{47]radiation levels on the iss are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low earth orbit as in the stratosphere for example on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 01 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 02 millisieverts per day; only 15 the rate experienced by an astronaut in leo additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while iss crew are exposed for their whole stay{278]see also: coronal mass ejection and aurora

murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months"nasa's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel initially studied when their manned missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the russian space station mir common sources of stress in early american missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family the latter is still often a cause of stress on the iss such as when the mother of nasa astronaut daniel tani died in a car accident and when michael fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second childa study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment{280] skylab's three crews remained one two and three months respectively long term crews on salyutxc2xa06 salyutxc2xa07 and the iss last about

(shown in centre) shot at 7xc2xa0kms (23000xc2xa0fts) the orbital velocity of the iss made this 15xc2xa0cm (59xc2xa0in) crater in a solid block of aluminiumradar-trackable objects including debris with distinct ring of geostationary satellitesat the low altitudes at which the iss orbits there is a variety of space debris{287] consisting of different objects including entire spent rocket stages defunct satellites explosion fragmentsxe2x80x94including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors and coolant released by us-a nuclear-powered satellites these objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids{288] are a significant threat large objects could destroy the station but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted{289]{290] objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments from approximately 1xc2xa0cm down to microscopic size number in the trillions despite their small size some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture causing exposure to vacuum{291]ballistic panels also called micrometeorite shielding are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems the type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage the station's shields and structure have different designs on the ros and the usos on the usos a thin aluminium sheet is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull thereby spreading the energy of impact on the ros a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering and glass cloth over the top it is about 50 less likely to be punctured and crew move to the ros when the station is under threat punctures on the ros would be contained within the panels which are 70xc2xa0cm squareexample of risk management: a nasa model showing areas at high risk from impact for the international space stationspace debris is tracked remotely from the ground and the station crew can be notified{292] this allows for a debris avoidance manoeuvre (dam) to be conducted which uses thrusters on the russian orbital segment to alter the station's orbital altitude avoiding the debris dams are not uncommon taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance eight dams had been performed prior to march 2009{293] the first seven between october 1999 and may 2003{294] usually the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres by means of an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1xc2xa0ms unusually there was a lowering of 17xc2xa0km on 27 august 2008 the first such lowering for 8 years{294]{295] there were two dams in 2009 on 22 march and 17 july{296] if a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a dam to be safely conducted the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their soyuz spacecraft so that they would be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris this partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 march 2009 28 june 2011 24 march 2012 and 16 june 2015{297]{298]end of missionmany iss resupply spacecraft have already undergone atmospheric re-entry such as jules verne atvaccording to a 2009 report space corporation energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the russian orbital segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station called the orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex (opsek) the modules under consideration for removal from the current iss include the multipurpose laboratory module (nauka) currently scheduled to be launched in 2017 and other russian modules which are planned to be attached to nauka afterwards those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020 the report presents a statement from an unnamed russian engineer that based on the experience from mir a 30-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind{299]according to the outer space treaty the united states and russia are legally responsible for all modules they have launched{300] in iss planning nasa examined options including returning the station to earth via shuttle missions (deemed too expensive as the usos is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions{301]) natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would delay reentry) and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area{302]a controlled deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be technically feasible only with russia's assistance{302] the russian space agency has experience from de-orbiting the salyut 4 5 6 7 and mir space stations; nasa's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite (the compton gamma ray observatory) occurred in 2000{303] as of late 2010 the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified progress spacecraft to de-orbit the iss{304] this plan was seen as the simplest cheapest and with the highest margin{304] skylab the only space station built and launched entirely by the us decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn remains of skylab hit populated areas of esperance western australia{305] without injuries or loss of lifethe exploration gateway platform a discussion by nasa and boeing at the end of 2011 suggested using leftover usos hardware and 'zvezda 2'  {sic] as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the earth-moon lagrange points l1 or l2 the entire usos cannot be reused and will be discarded but some russian modules are planned to be reused nauka the uzlovoy module two science power platforms and rassvet launched between 2010 and 2015 and joined to the ros may be separated to form opsek{306] nauka will be used in the station whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration opsek will orbit at a higher inclination of 71 degrees allowing observation to and from all of the russian federationin february 2015 roscosmos announced that it would remain a part of the iss programme until 2024{23] nine months earlierxe2x80x94in response to us sanctions against russia over the conflict in the crimeaxe2x80x94russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin had stated that russia would reject a us request to prolong the orbiting station's use beyond 2020 and would only supply rocket engines to the us for non-military satellite launches{307]a proposed modification that would reuse some of the iss american and european segments is to attach a vasimr drive module to the vacated node with its own onboard power source this would allow long-term reliability testing of the concept for less cost than building a dedicated space station from scratch{308]on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss{25]{26] igor komarov the head of russia's roscosmos made the announcement with nasa administrator charles bolden at his side komarov said "roscosmos together with nasa will work on the programme of a future orbital station" "we agreed that the group of countries taking part in the iss project will work on the future project of a new orbital station" "the first step is that the iss will operate until 2024" and that roscosmos and nasa "do not rule out that the station's flight could be extended"{309] in a statement provided to spacenews on 28 march nasa spokesman david weaver said the agency appreciated the russian commitment to extending the iss but did not confirm any plans for a future space station{28]on 30 september 2015 boeing's contract with nasa as prime contractor for the iss was extended to 30 september 2020 part of boeing's services under the contract will relate to extending the station's primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028{310]regarding extending the iss on 15 november 2016 general director vladimir solntsev of rsc energia stated "maybe the iss will receive continued resources today we discussed the possibility of using the station until 2028" and "much will depend on the political moments in relations with the americans with the new administration it will be discussed"{311]{312]costthe iss has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed{313] in 2010 the cost was expected to be 150xc2xa0billion this includes nasa's budget of 587xc2xa0billion (inflation-unadjusted) for the station from 1985 to 2015 (724xc2xa0billion in 2010 dollars) russia's 12xc2xa0billion europe's 5xc2xa0billion japan's 5xc2xa0billion canada's 2xc2xa0billion and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station; estimated at 14xc2xa0billion each or 504xc2xa0billion in total assuming 20000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews each person-day would cost 75xc2xa0million less than half the inflation-adjusted 196xc2xa0million (55xc2xa0million before inflation) per person-day of

slow-moving bright white dot because of reflected sunlight and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark{315] the iss takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the earth's shadow because of the size of its reflective surface area the iss is the brightest artificial object in the sky excluding flares with an approximate maximum magnitude of xe2x88x924 when overhead (similar to venus) the iss like many satellites including the iridium constellation can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of venus as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces{316]{317] the iss is also visible during broad daylight conditions albeit with a great deal more efforttools are provided by a number of websites such as heavens-above (see live viewing below) as well as smartphone applications that use the known orbital data and the observer's longitude and latitude to predict when the iss will be visible (weather permitting) where the station will appear to rise to the observer the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears to the observer either by setting below the horizon or entering into earth's shadow{318]{319]{320]{321]in november 2012 nasa launched its "spot the station" service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town{322]the station is visible from 95 of the inhabited land on earth but is not
