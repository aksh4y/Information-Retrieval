early-forming major hurricane in the caribbean and gulf of mexico during the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season dennis was the fourth named storm second hurricane and first major hurricane of the season in july the hurricane set several records for early season hurricane activity becoming the strongest atlantic hurricane ever to form before august; a title it held for only six days before being surpassed by hurricane emilydennis hit cuba twice as a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale and made landfall on the florida panhandle in the united states as a categoryxc2xa03 storm less than a year after hurricane ivan did so dennis killed 88 peoplexe2x80x9476xc2xa0directly and 12xc2xa0indirectlyxe2x80x94in the us and caribbean and caused 223xc2xa0billion

and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalethe incipient tropical wave that became dennis was identified on junexc2xa026 2005 well-inland over africa;{1]{2]{3] it later emerged over the atlantic ocean on junexc2xa029 and moved briskly to the west{1] dry air initially inhibited development{4]{5] though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on julyxc2xa04{1] the depression soon crossed grenada before entering the caribbean sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures fueled intensification{6]{7]{8] turning west-northwest the system achieved tropical storm status on julyxc2xa05 and hurricane status the following day{1] formation of a well-defined eye and central dense overcast signaled dennis's intensification into a major hurricane on julyxc2xa07{1]{9] throughout this phase the hurricane traversed the jamaica channel bringing deadly floods to both jamaica and haiti{1]the powerful storm soon struck granma province cuba as a categoryxc2xa04 early on julyxc2xa08; violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage briefly weakening due to interaction with land dennis quickly regained its strength paralleling the western coast of cuba dennis attained its peak winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) later that day before making a second landfall in the country this time in matanzas province{1] resumed interaction with the mountains of cuba caused significant weakening;{10] however once dennis emerged over the gulf of mexico on julyxc2xa09 it was able to quickly reorganize the hurricane reached categoryxc2xa04 strength for a third time on julyxc2xa010 as it approached florida attaining its lowest barometric pressure of 930xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2746xc2xa0inhg){1] this ranked dennis as the strongest pre-august hurricane in the atlantic basin; however this was eclipsed just six days later by hurricane emily which was the first july categoryxc2xa05 on record{11]{12] weakening ensued as the hurricane approached the florida panhandle ultimately making landfall over santa rosa island on julyxc2xa010 as a categoryxc2xa03 dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week traversing the mississippi river valley and ohio river valley before finally dissipating over ontario on julyxc2xa018{1]preparations{edit]caribbean{edit]in haiti officials evacuated residents along the coastline but noted that many were not obliging{13] in cuba more than 600000 residents were moved from their homes to government shelters or other locations in anticipation of dennis{14] all schools were closed and most flights in the country were suspended or cancelled{15]the cayman islands chapter of the red cross opened shelters on julyxc2xa07 and placed 120xc2xa0volunteers on standby schools and government offices closed for the duration of dennis's passage{16]united states{edit]in the united states the governors of florida alabama mississippi and louisiana all declared states of emergency in their states at 6xc2xa0am cdt (2300 utc) on july 9 2005 all southbound lanes on interstate 65 from mobile to montgomery alabama were closed traffic was redirected making all four lanes northbound to allow evacuations{17] in alabama residents in all parts of mobile county and those south of i-10 in baldwin county were ordered to evacuate{18] similar orders were issued in mississippi for parts of jackson hancock and harrison counties; and for coastal areas in the florida panhandle stretching from escambia county to bay county{18] likewise military installations such as nas pensacola whiting field eglin afb hurlburt field and tyndall afb were all evacuated days before the storm additionally red cross officials opened 87xc2xa0shelters across the state which were able to hold about 14000xc2xa0evacuees{17]in florida about 50000xc2xa0tourists in the keys were forced to evacuate by july 8{19] the macdill air force base in tampa evacuated its aircraft to mcconnell air force base near wichita kansas{20] 700000xc2xa0people in the florida panhandle were evacuated in the days prior to dennis 100000xc2xa0of them in escambia county alone{21] as a result of the large evacuations more than 200xc2xa0truckloads provided about 18xc2xa0million gallons of gasoline{22] the red cross also moved 60xc2xa0mobile canteens capable of serving 30000xc2xa0hot meals each a day to the staging points of hattiesburg and jackson national guardsmen were mobilized and four emergency medical teams each capable of setting up a small field hospital were on standby also at eglin air force base about 20000xc2xa0military personnel were evacuated and at hurlburt field home to air force's 16th special operations wing a mandatory evacuation was ordered for all 15000xc2xa0airmen and their families{23]impact{edit]effects of hurricane dennis by countrycountrydeathsdamage

in haiti the resulting torrents killed at least 56xc2xa0people injured 36xc2xa0others and left 24xc2xa0more missing{24] at least nine of the fatalities occurred when a bridge collapsed in grand-goxc3xa2ve{29]{30] extensive property damage was incurred with 929xc2xa0homes destroyed and another 3058xc2xa0damaged leaving 1500xc2xa0families homeless{24] damage totaled

damaging or destroying numerous homes and businesses the overflow of multiple rivers prompted evacuations in several towns and left many stranded saint thomas and portland parishes were hardest-hit overall one person died there and damage exceeded j2128xc2xa0billion (us345xc2xa0million){1]{26]{27]from there the storm moved to cuba leaving 16xc2xa0people dead and 14xc2xa0billion in damages as it roared through the island flattening houses and downing trees and power lines heavy rainfall fell across the country with amounts reaching up to 1092xc2xa0mm4299xc2xa0inches making dennis the wettest storm for the island since hurricane flora of 1963{31] according to reports from the cuban government 120000 homes were damaged 15000 of which were destroyed the citrus and vegetable industries were also devastated as cuba's primary agricultural regions were the hardest hit nonetheless fidel castro publicly refused us aid after the storm in protest of the ongoing us trade embargo against cuba stating that "if they offered 1xc2xa0billion we would say no"{32] relayed reports from cuban meteorologists stated that a gust up to 149xc2xa0mph (239xc2xa0kmh) was detected at cienfuegos 85 of the power lines were down and extensive damage to the communications infrastructure had occurred dennis was more destructive than the previous year's hurricane charley and was widely regarded as the worst hurricane to strike cuba since hurricane flora in the 1963 seasonunited states{edit]a beachfront home in navarre beach florida largely destroyed by hurricane dennismain articles: effects of hurricane dennis in florida effects of hurricane dennis in alabama effects of hurricane dennis in georgia and effects of hurricane dennis in mississippiin the united states damage was not as high as originally expected mainly because dennis was more compact and moved more quickly than initially forecast dennis made landfall approximately 30 miles (48xc2xa0km) to the east of where hurricane ivan had made landfall 10xc2xa0months before but did not cause as much damage as ivan due to its quicker speed compact size and because the area was not fully rebuilt dennis moved about 7xc2xa0mph (11xc2xa0kmh) faster than ivan at landfall and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40xc2xa0miles (65xc2xa0km) from its center compared to ivan's 105xc2xa0miles (170xc2xa0kmh){14]{33] during the height of the storm dennis produced storm surges as high as 9xc2xa0ft (3xc2xa0m) in the apalachee bay region and as high as 7xc2xa0ft (2xc2xa0m) on the florida panhandle{34] and left 680000 customers without electricity in four southern statesin southern florida damage was mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in miami-dade county gusty winds knocked out several traffic lights along us 1 the only route to and from the florida keys{35] a man died in ft lauderdale when he stepped on a downed electrical wire and was electrocuted{36] damage was mostly minor and limited to outer rainbands and tornadoes in central florida in the tampa bay area several tornadoes were reported to have touched down causing minor damage such as downed trees and power lines{37] the most severe damage occurred on the florida panhandle at navarre beach sustained winds of 98 miles per hour (158xc2xa0kmh) were reported with a peak gust of 121 miles per hour (195xc2xa0kmh) while a tower at the pensacola airport reported sustained winds of 82 miles per hour (132xc2xa0kmh) and a peak gust of 96 miles per hour (154xc2xa0kmh){1] milton received 708 inches (180xc2xa0mm) of rain the highest reported rainfall total in florida caused by dennis{38] no significant damage was reported to most structures; however insurers initially estimated that dennis caused 3xe2x80x935xc2xa0billion in insured damage{39] or approximately 6xe2x80x9310xc2xa0billion total (insured damage estimates are generally held to be approximately one-half of total damages) however the nhc's tropical cyclone report reported total damage in the united states as only 223xc2xa0billion with 1115xc2xa0billion of insured damage{1]in alabama sustained winds reached minimal hurricane force in the interior of the state{40] in total 280000xc2xa0people in alabama experienced power outages during the storm{41] no deaths occurred although dennis caused three injuries{42] and total damage amounted to 127xc2xa0million (2005xc2xa0usd){42] mostly due to structural damage there was also severe damage to cotton crops{43] in mississippi damage was not as severe as previously anticipated{44] as dennis impacted the state a storm tide of 2xc2xa0ft (061xc2xa0m)xe2x80x934xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) above normal was reported{1] rainfall from the hurricane averaged between 1xe2x80x935xc2xa0inches (25xe2x80x93125xc2xa0mm){45]{46] and minimum barometric pressure of 9942xc2xa0mb was reported near pascagoula{1] wind gusts peaked at 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) causing several hundred trees to uproot or snap damaging a total of 21xc2xa0homes and businesses{46]flooding caused by dennis on sweetwater creek in lithia springs georgiadennis caused at least 10 tornadoes in the us although only one of them reached f1 status on the fujita scale{1] the storm dropped over 10xc2xa0inches (250xc2xa0mm) of rain in some areas of alabama and georgia (see the rainfall graphic) parts of georgia which had received heavy rain just days earlier from hurricane cindy suffered heavy flooding and flash-floods were reported on the outskirts of the atlanta metropolitan area{not in citation given]{47]in the united states 15 storm-related deaths (14 in florida) were reported including one in walton county{48] three in broward county{1]{49] three in charlotte county one each in nassau and escambia counties{49] and one in decatur georgia{50] in the gulf of mexico the storm caused thunder horse pdq a bp oil rig about 150xc2xa0miles (240xc2xa0km) southeast of new orleans louisiana to severely list{51]aftermath{edit]see also:
