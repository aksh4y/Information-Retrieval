in 1978 and owned by robert brown{2] her home port was marblehead massachusetts she also sailed from gloucester massachusetts where she would offload her catch and reload food and stores for her next run she was originally named miss penny{citation needed]lost at sea{edit]final voyage{edit]andrea gail began her final voyage departing from gloucester harbor massachusetts on september 20 1991 bound for the grand banks of newfoundland off the coast of eastern canada after poor fishing captain frank w "billy" tyne jr headed east to the flemish cap where he believed they would have better luck despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions tyne set course for home on october 26xe2x80x9327{2] the ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and would not have been able to maintain the catch for much longer{3]disappearance{edit]the last reported transmission from andrea gail was at about 6:00xc2xa0pm on october 28 1991 captain tyne radioed linda greenlaw captain of the hannah boden owned by the same company and gave his coordinates as 44xc2xb000xe2x80xb2n 56xc2xb040xe2x80xb2wxefxbbxbf  xefxbbxbf44000xc2xb0n 56667xc2xb0wxefxbbxbf  44000; -56667{2] or about 162xc2xa0mi (261xc2xa0km) east of sable island he also gave a weather report indicating 30-foot (91xc2xa0m) seas and wind gusts up to 80xc2xa0knots (150xc2xa0kmh (93xc2xa0mph)) tyne's final recorded words were "she's comin' on boys and she's comin' on strong" junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of 100xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) in height but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of 39 feet (12xc2xa0m) and so waves of 100xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) were deemed "unlikely" by science daily{4] however data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding 60xc2xa0ft (18xc2xa0m) in height from october 28 through 30 1991{2]search{edit]on october 30 1991 the vessel was reported overdue an extensive air and land search was launched by the 106th rescue wing from the new york air national guard united states coast guard and canadian coast guard forces the search would eventually cover over 186000 square nautical miles (640000xc2xa0km2){5]on november 6 1991 andrea gail's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (epirb) was discovered washed up on the shore of sable island in nova scotia the epirb was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water but the canadian coast guard personnel who found the beacon "did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position"{2] authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on november 9 1991 due to the low probability of crew survival{2]fuel drums a fuel tank the epirb an empty life raft and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever found the ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the continental shelf near sable island{citation needed]crew{edit]all six of the crew were lost at seafrank william "billy" tyne jr (captain) aged 37{2] gloucester massachusettsmichael "bugsy" moran aged 36{2] bradenton beach floridadale r "murph" murphy aged 30{2] bradenton beach
