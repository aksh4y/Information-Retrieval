yucatan peninsula cayman islands louisianapart of the 2002 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane lili was the second deadliest and second costliest hurricane of the 2002 atlantic hurricane season being surpassed by hurricane isidore which affected the same areas around a week before lili lili was the twelfth named storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2002 atlantic hurricane season the storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the open atlantic on september 21 it continued westward affecting the lesser antilles as a tropical storm then entered the caribbean as it moved west the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of cuba and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened it turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on october 1 lili made two landfalls in western cuba later that day and then entered the gulf of mexico the hurricane rapidly strengthened on october 2 reaching categoryxc2xa04 strength that afternoon it weakened rapidly thereafter and hit louisiana as a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on october 3 it moved inland and dissipated on october 6{1]lili caused extensive damage through the caribbean particularly to crops and poorly built homes{2] mudslides were common on the more mountainous islands particularly haiti and jamaica{3] in the united states the storm cut off the production of oil within the gulf of mexico and caused severe damage in parts of louisiana lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state total damage amounted to 925xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd) and the storm killed 15xc2xa0people during its existence{1]{4]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 lesser antilles32 haiti33

according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september 16 a low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the african coast and the caribbean on september 20 the next day the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression{1]{5] the depression moved westward in excess of 20xc2xa0mph (32xc2xa0kmh) and reached tropical storm strength-becoming tropical storm lili as it passed through the windward islands{6] the cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the caribbean sea reaching a peak strength of 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) on the morning of september 24{7] this was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening and the storm's maximum sustained winds dropped to 40xc2xa0mph (64xc2xa0kmh) later that day{8] the sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear{9] the system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning and remained in that state for nearly two dayslili regenerated near jamaica on the evening of september 26 and gradually turned more to the west-northwest while strengthening{1] the system became a hurricane on september 30 just after passing through the cayman islands{10] the storm continued on its course while continuing to intensify and made landfall twice the next day on the isle of youth and near pinar del rxc3xado as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane{11] lili emerged over the gulf of mexico later that day having lost little strength during its overland passage{1]{12]the system turned to the northwest and sped up becoming a major hurricane on october 2 while 365 miles (587xc2xa0km) south-southeast of new orleans{13] this intensification continued aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the gulf of mexico and good outflow{14] the system reached its peak strength of categoryxc2xa04 intensity with winds of 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) during that afternoon{15]this strength was not maintained for long the storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of october 3{16] and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane's final landfall near intracoastal city louisiana due to a combination of vertical wind shear cool waters just offshore louisiana{17] and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant{18] by the time of landfall maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90xc2xa0mph (145xc2xa0kmh){19] the weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall{1] the system continued inland curving to the north-northeast and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the arkansastennessee border on october 6{1]preparations{edit]national hurricane center track forecast of lili from september 30tropical storm watches were issued in parts of the lesser antilles on september 22 these were upgraded to warnings the next afternoon and all advisories were dropped late on september 23 once the storm had passed{1] over the next week the islands of hispaniola jamaica cuba the caymans and the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula were all under advisories of some kind at different times{1] hurricane and tropical storm watches were issued for the gulf coast on october 1 and were upgraded to warnings the next morning{1] they were discontinued after the storm moved past the following day{20]strike probabilities associated with lili while still out in the south-central gulf of mexicobecause the cyclone affected the islands as a weak tropical storm preparations were minimal two hundred people evacuated their homes in advance of the storm on the islands of st vincent and grenadine{2] in jamaica all schools and universities were closed in advance of the storm and 17 public shelters were opened on the island{21]preparations were extensive in cuba military officials at guantanamo bay cuba prepared for the possibility of evacuating their al qaeda and taliban prisoners{22] a total of 130000 cuban citizens mainly in western portions of the island evacuated their homes prior to the storm{23]significant action was taken along the gulf coast as the threat the storm posed predicted to come ashore at category four strength became more urgent over a half million people evacuated their homes in texas and louisiana including everyone in iberia parish{24] a total of 200000xc2xa0people evacuated in louisiana{24]{25] at least 2000 volunteers staffed 115 red cross shelters in louisiana texas mississippi and alabama{26] more than 20000xc2xa0people stayed in those shelters{25] the red cross also sent over 160000 meals to the area{26] a total of 3000 prison inmates in texas were evacuated to safer inland locations{24] the launch of space shuttle atlantis was delayed for five days when the kennedy space center was threatened by the storm the first time a launch in florida had been delayed because of weather in houston{27] stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm in new iberia louisiana hardware stores ran out of stock{28] and businesses in lafayette louisiana reported similar shortages{29]collegiate activities were also affected by the storm southern university canceled four days of classes because of lili{30] and 20 texas am university galveston texas students evacuated to the school's college station location{31] the university of south alabama canceled two athletic events in advance of the storm{32]impact{edit]death toll by areastatecountrydeathssaint lucia4jamaica4haiti4cuba1united states2puerto

(isidore killed 22 people and damaged 13 billion worth of property){33] a total of 13xc2xa0people died in the caribbean islands and 2 more were killed in the united states{1] severe damage to crops and livestock occurred through the lesser antilles and damage to buildings and other infrastructure was reported in other caribbean nations and the united states{1]lesser antilles{edit]lili affected the islands as a tropical storm winds in the area were generally below hurricane force although some gusts exceeded 74xc2xa0mph (119xc2xa0kmh){1] rainfall of up to 4 inches (100xc2xa0mm) caused deadly mudslides{2] the winds combined with poor construction tore the roofs off numerous homes and businesses the majority of the damage was dealt to primarily to the banana crop{34]st lucia lost at least 75xc2xa0percent of its banana crop and hundreds of homes were damaged by the strong winds{2] near total loss of electricity water and telephone services occurred and utility systems were heavily damaged{34] four people were killed on the island and total damage was estimated at 20xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd 235xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd){1]{34]over 400xc2xa0homes were damaged in barbados and nearly 50xc2xa0trees were downed by the high gusts similar to in st lucia there was significant damage to the nation's banana crop{34] extensive loss of electricity and telephone service also occurred damage totaled at nearly 200000 (2002xc2xa0usd 235000 2007xc2xa0usd)grenada also experienced moderate damage a total of 14xc2xa0homes' roofs were damaged and one was completely destroyed the island medical centre's roof was also damaged and 12xc2xa0landslides were reported{34] there was also mild damage to infrastructure particularly in st patrick's parish; three bridges were damaged or destroyed along with seven utility poles and a water main the entire island was without power at some point but it was quickly restored in the southern part of the island where damage to the poles themselves was less significant{34]st vincent and the grenadines were heavily damaged especially compared to other islands in the area several hundred homes and two schools were damaged and the rose hall police station's roof was lost{34] still the majority of damage was dealt to the agricultural industry{34] in all damage to the islands totaled 40xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd 47xc2xa0million

offshore of haiti as a dissipating tropical storm{1] the storm's major impact was extremely heavy rainfall in excess of 16 inches (410xc2xa0mm) near the settlement of camp-perrin haiti{42] this caused the ravine du sud river to overflow and submerge buildings in the town two people died in the mudslides these rains triggered and two more drowned in the flooding around camp-perrin{43] the floods also seriously damaged crops and infrastructure; over 1700xc2xa0homes were damaged and 240 were destroyed haiti was affected dramatically and many towns and villages submerged into rivers exceeding their bankfull discharge{43]jamaica{edit]lili affected jamaica as a strengthening tropical storm wind gusts in excess of 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) and rainfall over 2 feet (061xc2xa0m) resulted in damage to homes crops and utility systems{1]{21]extremely heavy rainfall inundated the island cedar valley recorded the most rainfall with 231 inches (590xc2xa0mm) measured this led to prolific flooding that triggered mudslides across the island and killed four people these floods decimated the island's sugar cane crop one of the island's principal exports{21] the resultant flooding caused widespread problems with the infrastructure of the island all of the island's hospitals had flood damage and three were also dealt structural damage by the strong winds{44] the flooding caused latrines and other sewage sources to overflow into the intake sources for the water supply leading to fear of disease{44]cuba{edit]hurricane lili over cuba on october 1lili made landfall as a category two hurricane twice in cuba on the isle of youth and in the pinar del rxc3xado province on october 1 wind gusts up to 112xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) and rainfall amounts reaching 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) in some places caused damage to homes businesses and crops one person was killed{1]{45]damage to buildings and other infrastructure was significant the most severely affected provinces were pinar del rxc3xado and la habana a total of 48000xc2xa0homes were damaged 16000 of them lost their roofs the province sancti spiritus was not affected as severely as only 945xc2xa0homes were damaged with 500 losing their roofs the provinces in eastern cuba including guantanamo suffered similar damage{46] electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks in parts of the western provinces this led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages{45] the tobacco and rice crops were badly depleted but it was difficult to differentiate how much damage was caused by lili since isidore had struck the region just a week earlier{45]{47]louisiana{edit]lili storm total rainfall in the united stateslili made landfall on the morning of october 3 near intracoastal city as a weakening category one hurricane{1] wind gusts reaching 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) coupled with over 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rainfall and a storm surge of 12 feet (37xc2xa0m) caused over 790xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd; 1xc2xa0billion 2007xc2xa0usd) in damage to louisiana a total of 237000xc2xa0people lost power and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week{48] crops were badly affected particularly the sugar cane damage totaled nearly 175xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd; 205xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd) no direct deaths were reported as early warnings and the compact nature of the storm circumvented major loss of life{49]vermillion parish the point of landfall was hardest hit wind gusts in excess of 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) along with a storm surge of 12 feet (37xc2xa0m) dealt major damage to nearly 4000xc2xa0homes{48] the worst storm surge flooding occurred in intracoastal city destroying 20xc2xa0buildings owned by a helicopter company one person died after the storm and 20 were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning{48]louisiana coastal flooding associated with liliacadia parish was also hard hit recording wind gusts exceeding 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) and 5xc2xa0tornadoes touched down in the parish{48] thousands of homes were damaged with over 2500 suffering severe damage power across the parish was knocked out 2xc2xa0people were injured and one was killed after the storm schools in the parish also sustained 16xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd; 19xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd) in damage{48]mississippi{edit]lili's outer rainbands dumped large amounts of rain and brought tropical storm force wind gusts to mississippi{50] pascagoula mississippi recorded wind gusts of 41xc2xa0mph (66xc2xa0kmh) and picayune mississippi received 414 inches (105xc2xa0mm) of rainfall minor power outages occurred mainly in southern mississippi and combined with the flooding of roads and buildings caused 30xc2xa0million (2002xc2xa0usd; 35xc2xa0million 2007xc2xa0usd) in damage no deaths occurred in mississippi{1]other areas in the united states{edit]hurricane lili's remnants brought heavy rainfall peaking at four inches in arkansas to the southeast before dissipating near the arkansas-tennessee border lili's remnants also caused minimal rainfall in the lower tennessee valley no major damage was reported{1] in all lili caused 820 million in damage to the united states lili also caused a little girl to be born in massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date her mother named her after the storm lilly this girl has grown with the fury and intensity of this stormaftermath{edit]disaster declarations by parish within louisiana from hurricane lilipresident bush declared louisiana a federal disaster area after the storm making it eligible for assistance{51] fema set up three locations to apply in mississippi and louisiana applications began pouring in 153000 by the time of the deadline{52]{53] over 311xc2xa0million in aid was granted to louisiana{54] a total of 50xc2xa0million of that money was in the form of low interest loans and not actual grantsover 1000xc2xa0power workers from eight different states went to the worst hit areas to help restore power{55]{56] seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed the recovery process{57] in addition fema gave slemco the state's power company an 86xc2xa0million grant which paid for 75 of the damage to the electrical grid there{58] it took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers{59]hurricane lili caused great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in louisiana huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point and in the atchafalaya swamp the barrier islands to the east of the landfall point those subjected to the highest surge were severely eroded sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes burying vegetation the freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge some of them completely destroyed the severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the gulf of mexico which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons{60]retirement{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesthe name lili was retired in the spring of 2003 because of its destruction and deadly caribbean track and will never be used again in the atlantic basin it was replaced with laura for the 2008 season{61] the names lucy and lisette were also suggested as possible
