linkshistory{edit]the national diet library is the successor of three separate libraries: the library of the house of peers the library of the house of representatives both of which were established at the creation of japan's imperial diet in 1890; and the imperial library which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the ministry of educationthe diet's power in prewar japan was limited and its need for information was "correspondingly small" the original diet libraries "never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity" until japan's defeat moreover the executive had controlled all political documents depriving the people and the diet of access to vital information the us occupation forces under general douglas macarthur deemed reform of the diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of japan after its defeat in world war iiin 1946 each house of the diet formed its own national diet library standing committee hani gorxc5x8d a marxist historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the house of councillors (the successor to the abolished house of peers) after the war spearheaded the reform efforts hani envisioned the new body as "both a 'citadel of popular sovereignty" and the means of realizing a "peaceful revolution'" the occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that although the occupation was a catalyst for change local initiative pre-existed the occupation and the successful reforms were due to dedicated japanese like hanithe national diet library opened in june 1948 in the present-day state guest-house (former akasaka detached palace) with an initial collection of 100000 volumes the first librarian of the diet library was the politician tokujirxc5x8d kanamori{3] the philosopher masakazu nakai served as the first vice librarian{3] in
