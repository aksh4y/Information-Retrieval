in other words the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries for chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry grouplaws of physics are so(3)-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space because of noether's theorem rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation lawdiscrete rotational symmetry{edit]rotational symmetry of orderxc2xa0n also called n-fold rotational symmetry or discrete rotational symmetry of the nth order with respect to a particular point (in 2d) or axis (in 3d) means that rotation by an angle of 360xc2xb0n (180xc2xb0 120xc2xb0 90xc2xb0 72xc2xb0 60xc2xb0 51xc2xa0xe2x80x8a3xe2x81x847xc2xb0 etc) does not change the object note that "1-fold" symmetry is no symmetry (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360xc2xb0)the notation for n-fold symmetry is cn or simply "n" the actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry together with the n for each point or axis of symmetry the abstract group type is cyclic group of orderxc2xa0n zn although for the latter also the notation cn is used the geometric and abstract cn should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different see cyclic symmetry groups in 3dthe fundamental domain is a sector of 360xc2xb0nexamples without additional reflection symmetry:n = 2 180xc2xb0: the dyad;

in the case of 2-fold symmetry only the shape of the parallelogram can be different for the case p6 a fundamental domain is indicated in yellow2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the frieze groups there are two rotocenters per primitive celltogether with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups with axes per primitive cell:p2 (2222): 4xc3x972-fold; rotation group of a parallelogrammic rectangular and rhombic latticep3 (333): 3xc3x973-fold; not the rotation group of any lattice (every lattice is upside-down the same but that does not apply for this symmetry); it is eg the rotation group of the regular triangular tiling with the equilateral triangles alternatingly coloredp4 (442): 2xc3x974-fold 2xc3x972-fold; rotation group of a square latticep6 (632): 1xc3x976-fold 2xc3x973-fold 3xc3x972-fold; rotation group of a hexagonal lattice2-fold rotocenters (including possible 4-fold and 6-fold) if present at all form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice scaled by a factor 12 in the case translational symmetry in one dimension a similar property applies though the term "lattice" does not apply3-fold rotocenters (including possible 6-fold) if present at all form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice rotated by 30xc2xb0 (or equivalently 90xc2xb0) and scaled by a factor 133{displaystyle {frac {1}{3}}{sqrt {3}}}4-fold rotocenters if present at all form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice rotated by 45xc2xb0 and scaled by a factor 122{displaystyle {frac {1}{2}}{sqrt {2}}}6-fold rotocenters if present at all form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational latticescaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor therefore the number of 2- 3- 4- and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4 3 2 and 1 respectively again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold etc3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one (or ditto in 3d with respect to parallel axes) implies rotation group p6 ie double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point (or in 3d parallel axis) the translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is 2xe2x88x9a3 times their distanceeuclidean planehyperbolic planehexakis triangular tiling an example of p6 {63]+ (632) (with colors) and p6m {63] (632) (without colors);
