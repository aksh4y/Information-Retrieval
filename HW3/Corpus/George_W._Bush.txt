that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs{104] treasury secretary paul h o'neill opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine social security{105] o'neill disputes the claim made in bush's book decision points that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts{106] by 2003 the economy showed signs of improvement though job growth remained stagnant{52] another tax cut program was passed that yearduring the 2001 to 2008 years gdp grew at an average annual rate of 2125xc2xa0percent{107] less than for past

100xc2xa0percent from 2000 when the debt was only 56xc2xa0trillion{116]{117] most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the "bush tax cuts" and increased national security spending{118] in march 2006 then-senator barack obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: "the fact that we are here today to debate raising america's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure"{119] by the end of bush's presidency unemployment climbed to 72xc2xa0percent{120]in december 2007 the united states entered the longest postxe2x80x93world war ii recession{97] which included a housing market correction a subprime mortgage crisis soaring oil prices and a declining dollar value{121] in february 63000 jobs were lost a five-year record{122]{123] to aid with the situation bush signed a 170xc2xa0billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses the bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac in 2003{124] and after two years the regulations passed the house but died in the senate many republican senators as well as influential members of the bush administration feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices{125]{126]{127] in september 2008 the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac followed by the collapse of lehman brothers and a federal bailout of american international group for 85xc2xa0billion{128]many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the great depression{129]{130] additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan{131] bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the us mortgage market{132] vince reinhardt a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute said "it would have helped for the bush administration to empower the folks at treasury and the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the fdic to look at these issues more closely" and additionally that it would have helped "for congress to have held hearings"{126]in november 2008 over 500000 jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the united states in 34 years{133] the bureau of labor statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008 19xc2xa0million jobs were lost{134] by the end of 2008 the us had lost a total of 26xc2xa0million jobs{135]education and healthbush undertook a number of

child left behind act into law january 8 2002one of the administration's early major initiatives was the no child left behind act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools and target more federal funding to low-income schools this landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of senator ted kennedy of massachusetts{137] it was signed into law by bush in early 2002{138] many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the us have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed "no child left behind" into law{139] critics argue that it is underfunded{140] and that nclba's focus on "high-stakes testing" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive{141]after being re-elected bush signed into law a medicare drug benefit program that according to jan crawford resulted in "the greatest expansion in america's welfare state in forty years;" the bill's costs approached 7xc2xa0trillion{142] in 2007 bush opposed and vetoed state children's health insurance program (schip) legislation which was added by the democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by congress the schip legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about sixxc2xa0million to tenxc2xa0million children it was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax{143] bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as 83000 per year who did not need the help{144]social services and social securityfollowing republican efforts to pass the medicare act of 2003 bush signed the bill which included major changes to the medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits{145] the retired persons lobby group aarp worked with the bush administration on the program and gave their endorsement bush said the law estimated to cost 400xc2xa0billion over the first ten years would give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care"{146]president bush discussing social security reform at the lake nona ymca family center in orlando florida march 18 2005bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to "reform" social security{147] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005 bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the us congress{147] in his 2005 state of the union address bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax (fica) into secured investments{147] democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system{147]bush embarked on a 60-day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "conversations on social security" in an attempt to gain public support{148] nevertheless public support for the proposal declined{149] and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda{150] the proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane katrina{151] after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in officeenvironmental policiesmain article: domestic policy of the george w bush administration xc2xa7xc2xa0environmentupon taking office in 2001 bush stated his opposition to the kyoto protocol an amendment to the united nations framework convention on climate change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted 80xc2xa0percent of the world's population{152] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year{153] he also cited that the senate had voted 95xe2x80x930 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocolin may 2001 bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects{154] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues{155]in 2002 bush announced the clear skies act of 2003{156] aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal{157] the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committeelater in 2006 bush declared the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahxc4x81naumokuxc4x81kea marine national monument comprises 84xc2xa0million acres (340000xc2xa0km2) and is home to 7000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands{158] the move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area"{159]bush has said that he believes that global warming is real{160] and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused"{161] the bush administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities critics have alleged that the administration{162] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming{163]energy policiesin his 2006 state of the union address bush declared "america is addicted to oil" and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase energy development research{164]president bush delivering a statement on energy urging congress to end offshore oil drill ban june 18 2008in his 2007 state of the union address bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production{165] amid high gasoline prices in 2008 bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling{166] however the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said "this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the us congress"{166] bush had said in june 2008 "in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production"{167]in his 2008 state of the union address bush announced that the us would commit 2xc2xa0billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying "along with contributions from other countries this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner more efficient technologies in developing nations like india and china and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive" he also announced plans to reaffirm the united states' commitment to work with major economies and through the un to complete an international agreement that will slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated "this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride"{168]stem cell research and first vetofederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the dickey-wicker amendment by congress and the signature of president bill clinton{169] bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research however bush did not support embryonic stem cell research{170] on august 9 2001 bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing "lines" of stem cells{171] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines{172] on july 19 2006 bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo{173]genetic nondiscriminationon may 21 2008 president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina){174]{175] the bill aims to protect americans against

the united states from 2000 to 2005 more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history{176] almost half entered illegally{177] in 2006 bush urged congress to allow more than 12xc2xa0million illegal immigrants to work in the united states with the creation of a "temporary guest-worker program" bush also urged congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6000 national guard troops to the mexicoxe2x80x93united states border{178] from may to june 2007 bush strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the bush administration{179] the bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based "merit" system for green cards; elimination of "chain migration" and of the diversity immigrant visa; and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of us laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor{180] bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty{181]a heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions{182] the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28 2007 when a cloture motion failed on a 46xe2x80x9353 vote{183] bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives{184] the bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law{185]on september 19 2010 former israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that bush

louisiana mississippi and alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was "not enough"{194]as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown;{195] it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war{196] and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods{197]{198]{199] bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency{193] it has been argued that with katrina bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover{200]midterm dismissal of us attorneysmain article: dismissal of us attorneys controversypresident bush announcing his nomination of alberto gonzales as the next us attorney

committee issued subpoenas for advisers harriet miers and josh bolten to testify regarding this matter but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice the justice department determined that the president's order was legal{205]although congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the us attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released on march 10 2008 the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas{206] on july 31 2008 a united states district court judge ruled that bush's top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas{207]in all twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress they included attorney general alberto gonzales{208] and his chief of staff kyle sampson{209] gonzales' liaison to the white house monica goodling{210] aide to the president karl rove{211] and his senior aide sara taylor{212] in addition legal counsel to the president harriet miers{213] and deputy chief of staff to the president joshua bolten{214] were both found in contempt of congress{212]in 2010 the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings{215] the firings were "inappropriately political" but not criminal according to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense{216]purge of the central intelligence agencyfollowing the resignation of cia director george tenet in 2004 bush nominated porter goss to head the agency the white house ordered goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration{217] after goss' appointment many of the cia's senior agents

decades of us policy{225] the visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation discussions that would lead eventually to the indiaxe2x80x93united states civil nuclear agreement{226]this is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor clinton whose approach and response to india after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bush's tenure{227]midway through bush's second term it was questioned whether bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former soviet republics in central asia{228]in an address before both houses of congress on september 20 2001 bush

in his january 29 2002 state of the union address he asserted that an "axis of evil" consisting of north korea iran and iraq was "arming to threaten the peace of the world" and "pose{d] a grave and growing danger"{233] the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war{234] this became the basis for the bush doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september 11 attacks{235]dissent and criticism of bush's leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in iraq continued{236]{237]{238] in 2006 a national intelligence estimate concluded that the iraq war had become the "cause cxc3xa9lxc3xa8bre for jihadists"{239]{240]afghanistan

al-qaeda leaders{241] later that month the un had installed the afghan transitional administration chaired by hamid karzai{242]{243] in 2002 based on unicef figures nicholas kristof reported that "our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid{244]efforts to kill or capture al-qaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december 2001 in the mountainous region of tora bora which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough us ground troops{245] it was not until may 2011 two years after bush left office that bin laden was killed by us forces under the obama administration bin laden's successor ayman al-zawahiri

through possession of weapons of mass destruction{233]{252]in the latter half of 2002 cia reports contained assertions of saddam hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions{253]{254] contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president{255]{256]in late 2002 and early 2003 bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis in november 2002 hans blix and mohamed elbaradei led un weapons inspectors in iraq but were advised by the us to depart the country four days prior to the us invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks{257] the us initially sought a un security council

operations increased his popularity but the us and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; bush's "mission accomplished" speech was later criticized as premature{260] from 2004 until 2007 the situation in iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in iraq{261] bush's policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from iraq the 2006 report of the bipartisan iraq study group led by james baker concluded that the situation in iraq was "grave and deteriorating" while bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of iraq{262] he maintained he would not change the overall iraq strategy{263]{264] according to iraq body count

this country"{266] bush praised the event as well saying that the iraqis "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny"{266] this led to the election of jalal talabani as president and nouri al-maliki as prime minister of iraq a referendum to approve a constitution in iraq was held in october 2005 supported by most shiites and many kurds{267]on january 10 2007 bush announced a surge of

praised the iraqi government's "bold decision" to launch the battle of basra against the mahdi army calling it "a defining moment in the history of a free iraq"{271] he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008 he also praised the iraqis' legislative achievements including a pension law a revised de-baathification law a new budget an amnesty law and a provincial powers measure that he said set the stage for the iraqi elections{272] by july 2008 american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began{273] and due to increased stability in iraq bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forces{273]surveillancefollowing the events of september 11 bush issued an executive order authorizing the president's surveillance program which included allowing the nsa to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the us and parties within the us without obtaining a warrant as required by the foreign intelligence surveillance act{274] as of 2009 the other provisions of the program remained highly classified{275] once the department of justice office of legal counsel questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re-authorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the authorization for use of military force against terrorists{276] the program proved to be controversial as critics of the administration as well as organizations such as the american bar association argued that it was illegal{277] in august 2006 a us district court judge ruled that the nsa electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional{278] but on july 6 2007 that ruling was vacated by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing{279] on january 17 2007 attorney general alberto gonzales informed us senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the president but would be subjected to judicial oversight{280] later in 2007 the nsa launched a replacement for the program referred to as prism that was subject to the oversight of the united states

certain enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be legal based on a secret justice department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the geneva conventions' ban on torture and vice president cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal{287]{288] the cia had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the bybee memo from the attorney general though that memo was later withdrawn{289] while not permitted by the us army field manuals which assert "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information"{287] the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations "provided critical information" to preserve american lives{290] critics such as former cia officer bob baer have stated that information was suspect "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough"{291]on october 17 2006 bush signed into law the military commissions act of 2006{292] a law enacted in the wake of the supreme court's decision in hamdan v rumsfeld 548 us 557 (2006){293] which allows the us government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial the law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture{292]on march 8 2008 bush vetoed hr 2082{294] a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the united states army field manual on human intelligence collector operations saying that "the bill congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror"{295] in april 2009 the aclu sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the bush administration's interrogation tactics{296] one memo detailed specific

stated that "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by north korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the united states" for which north korea would be held accountable{299] on may 7 2007 north korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account this was a result of a series of
