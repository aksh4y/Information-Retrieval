on 1800 utc september 20 the eastern pacific hurricane center initiated advisories on the system and classified it as tropical depression twenty-two at that time it was located 200xc2xa0mi (320xc2xa0km) west of managua nicaragua and supported winds of 35xc2xa0mph (50xc2xa0kmh) the depression turned northward in response to a weak steering flow between two high pressure systemsxe2x80x94one near cabo san lucas and the other west of central america it then moved inland near the el salvadorxe2x80x93guatemala border and dissipated overland{1]under the influence of a persistent stationary trough near california the remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the pacific advisories on the system were resumed late on septemberxc2xa020 though it was reconsidered a tropical cyclone its wind circulation was poorly defined; the depression again degenerated into an open trough at 0000 utc september 22 its forward motion remained relatively unchanged for several days and by september 24 the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone after briefly drifting northward the system began tracking toward the west-northwest it gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000 utc september 25 since it was then situated over favorable sea surface temperatures between 28xc2xa0xc2xb0c (82xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and 29xc2xa0xc2xb0c (84xc2xa0xc2xb0f) paul underwent a phase of rapid intensification this allowed it to reach category 1 hurricane strength on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale (sshws) just two days after its naming{1]upon becoming a hurricane paul turned to the north and continued to develop{1] as the storm neared baja california sur it reached category 2 intensity{2] an upper-level trough forced the hurricane to accelerate towards the northeast at which point it had reached peak wind speeds of 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) from 1800 to 2100 utc on september 29 the eye of the hurricane made landfall along baja california sur moving ashore less than 100xc2xa0mi (160xc2xa0km) south of la paz near san josxc3xa9 del cabo after weakening slightly inland paul briefly reemerged over water and subsequently made its final landfall near los mochis sinaloa with winds of 100xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh){1] tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued shortly thereafter{2] though exact information on the storm after it moved inland is unavailable due to a lack of data completion in the hurricane database{3]preparations{edit]hurricane paul after landfallan alert was issued for the mexican states of sonora and sinaloa and baja california sur;
