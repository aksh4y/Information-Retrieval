vacated both titles before moving on to nwa worldwide{3] once there helms joined the bad street boys with shannon moore christian york and joey matthews{3]world championship wrestling (1999xe2x80x932001){edit]main article: 3 counthelms and his friend shannon moore signed with world championship wrestling (wcw) in may 1999{3] in wcw helms along with moore and evan karagias formed the heel (villainous) stable (faction) 3 count and the trio debuted on the december 23 episode of wcw thunder{8] the trio was a parody of the boy bands 'n sync and the backstreet boys and their

dragons with the dragons attempting to steal 3 count's fictional recording contract{3] this led to a ladder match between the two teams at new blood rising which 3 count won due to abbott's interference{10] as a result abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 count and was kicked out by the other three members leading to a feud{11]3 count later disbanded as moore and helms kicked karagias out of the group for attempting to steal the spotlight{3] at the same time the jung dragons turned on jamie noble who formed a team with karagias{3] the three teams met in a triangle match at mayhem which 3 count won{12] they also wrestled each other in a number one contendership ladder match at starrcade to earn a wcw cruiserweight championship match in which both moore and helms grabbed the contract at the same time{13] as a result they later wrestled for the opportunity to wrestle for the championship which helms won although he lost the subsequent championship match to chavo guerrero at the sin pay-per-view{3]{14]moore and helms would leave wcw briefly in 2001 to wrestle in nwa wildside where they held the wildside tag team championship for one day{3] helms became the number one contender for the cruiserweight championship after winning a match at superbrawl revenge but was attacked by karagias and moore afterwards{3]{15] despite the attack helms would go on to defeat guerrero for the wcw cruiserweight championship at greed and was the reigning cruiserweight champion immediately before wcw was bought out by the world wrestling federation (wwf){1]{3]{16] helms' contract with wcw was one of twenty-five that were included in wwf's purchase of wcw{17]world wrestling federation  entertainment (2001 - 2010){edit]early appearances (2001xe2x80x932002){edit]helms made his wwf debut on the july 5 2001 episode of smackdown! using the name "hollywood" gregory helms{3] he was part of the invasion storyline as a member of the alliance losing his cruiserweight championship in a one-on-one match to another alliance member billy kidman{18]helms at an autograph signing in june 2002helms began wrestling as "the hurricane" on august 27 and also began wearing a superhero costume that night he won the wwf european championship from matt hardy with help from ivory but lost it to bradshaw on october 22 2001{19]{20] in september 2001 helms formed a tag team with lance storm who was now managed by ivory and helms later picked up a sidekick in molly holly who began to call herself "mighty molly" and the two came to the arena in a custom "hurri-cycle" (with molly in the sidecar){7] the team of helms and storm began feuds with teams like the hardy boyz and big show and spike dudley helms and storm got a shot at the wcw tag team championship against the hardy boyz at no mercy in a losing effort{21]during 2002 the hurricane won the wwf hardcore championship at wrestlemania x8 but molly betrayed him hitting him in the back of the head with a frying pan and defeating him for the championship{22]{23] helms was later drafted to the smackdown! brand following the brand extension and he won the cruiserweight championship from tajiri and billy kidman in a triple threat match{24]{25] he lost it to jamie noble at king of the ring later in 2002 he was traded to raw won the world tag team championship with kane and held them for around a month in an alliance known as hurri-kane{26]teaming with rosey (2003xe2x80x932005){edit]main article: the hurricane and roseyhelms as "the hurricane" with the world tag team championshipin 2003 hurricane feuded with the rock{27] in backstage segments the rock referred to the hurricane as "the hamburglar" (in part because his mask was similar to the hamburglar's){28] the feud culminated in a match on raw in which the rock dominated{29] hurricane however was able to roll up the rock from behind after the rock was distracted by stone cold steve austin's appearance on the ramp{29]in late 2003 hurricane "discovered" rosey's potential as a superhero and christened him "rosey the super hero in training" (the "shit") on may 1 at backlash the hurricane and rosey defeated la rxc3xa9sistance in the finals of a tag team turmoil match to win the world tag team championship{30]{31] not long after winning the championship stacy keibler joined rosey and the hurricane as their sidekick "super stacy"{32] in august 2005 rosey and the hurricane lost keibler as their sidekick when she and christy hemme were traded to the smackdown! brand{33] on september 5 2005 hurricane and rosey were defeated by lance cade and trevor murdoch during cade and murdoch's debut match on raw{34] as a result cade and murdoch earned a title match at the unforgiven pay-per-view during the title match murdoch delivered an elevated ddt on the hurricane to the outside the ddt caused hurricane to suffer a storyline "stinger" and allowed cade and murdoch to beat the injured hurricane later in the match to win the world tag team titles{35]during the next few weeks the pair began a losing streak mainly caused by hurricane's on-screen injuries{36] during the october 17 episode of raw the hurricane was assaulted by kurt angle at the request of vince mcmahon after the beating footage was shown of the hurricane ripping off his mask and striking rosey because he did not help him fend off angle{37] the next week the hurricane no-showed a world tag team title match leaving rosey to face the champions alone during the match the hurricane (out of costume) appeared at the top of the entrance ramp reverting to his real name gregory helms and watched as rosey was double teamed and defeated after the match helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he was sick of carrying rosey as a tag team partner this turned him into a heel in the process{38] on the november 7 episode of raw helms and rosey faced off in a singles match which helms won{39] subsequently helms wrestled mostly on raw's sister show heat{40] on the january 2 2006 episode of raw helms confronted jerry lawler over jokes that lawler had been making at helms' expense and lawler said that when helms was the hurricane he was entertaining and called helms a joke helms responded by slapping lawler who hit helms back{41] this confrontation led to lawler defeating helms in a match at new year's revolution{42]cruiserweight champion and injury (2006xe2x80x932007){edit]at the 2006 royal rumble helms participated in an open invitational match for the cruiserweight championship and won even though he was a raw superstar and the championship was defended solely on smackdown!{42]{43] as a result he returned to the smackdown! brand in february 2006 to start a feud with nunzio kid kash and the other cruiserweights during this time helms defeated nunzio in a one-on-one match{44] the next week he was supposed to defend against kid kash but kash was away on a family emergency so scotty 2 hotty took his place helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights as a result all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked helms{45] it was later announced by smackdown! general manager theodore long that at the no way out pay-per-view event helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title helms was able to retain the championship{46] later long mandated that helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on smackdown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights helm's first defense under this new rule was against psicosis of the mexicools; helms retained by cheating{42]helms has the longest reign in wwe cruiserweight championship history holding the championship for 13 consecutive months in 2006 and 2007in early march 2006 helms suffered a broken nose after complaining to long about having to wrestle on the march 10 episode of smackdown! long told helms that he did not have to defend his title but put helms in a champion versus champion match against the united states champion chris benoit during the match helms attempted to leave but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw helms back into the ring resulting in helms losing the match{47] helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks during this time smackdown! announcers stated that helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury helms returned to the ring on the april 28 episode of smackdown! teaming with mnm to face super crazy london and kendrick in a six-man tag team match{48] helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views{49]

title holders in champion versus champion matches helms faced world heavyweight champion rey mysterio on june 16 and united states champion bobby lashley on july 7 but lost both matches{51]{52]

with whom helms exchanged several victories in matches on smackdown!{53]{54]{55] in helms' hometown of raleigh north carolina at the 2006 no mercy pay-per-view hardy beat helms{56] the two rivals also joined opposing teams at survivor series where helms was in team rated-rko and hardy was a member of team dx; team rated-rko lost the match{56]helms went on to feud with jimmy wang yang over the cruiserweight title after a tag team match in which matt hardy and yang defeated helms and sylvan{57] the feud ended after helms defeated him to retain the title at armageddon in december 2006{56] in 2007 helms once again feuded with the entire cruiserweight division on smackdown! during this feud helms' reign as cruiserweight champion came to an end at no way out when he was unable to win a cruiserweight open invitational which saw chavo guerrero win the championship{58] shortly after losing the championship helms formed a tag team with guerrero but they did not win any matches as a team{59]{60]on may 18 2007 wwe reported that helms had broken two vertebrae in his neck one of which was pressing on his spinal cord{61] he underwent surgery with dr lloyd youngblood to repair them
