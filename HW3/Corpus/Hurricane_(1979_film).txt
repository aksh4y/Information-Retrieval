sometimes he would touch his nose and say 'i can smell it!' i like dino in many ways but it was difficult making that kind of movie for him the characters got lost in the special effects{4]the film was the final score of composer nino rota who died two days before its premierecast{edit]jason robards - captain brucknermia farrow - charlotte brucknermax von sydow - dr danielssontrevor howard - father malonetimothy bottoms - jack sanfordjames keach - sgt strangdayton ka'ne xe2x80x93 matangibernadette sarcione - sivareception{edit]it received mixed reviews from critics and a 50 rating on rotten tomatoes{5]release{edit]the film was aired on television as forbidden paradise{6] legend films via their partnership with paramount home entertainment released the film on dvd on july 1 2008references{edit]^ 'the hurricane' builds--in cost by aljean harmetz new york times (1923-current file) {new york ny] 01 june 1978: c15^ "review: 'hurricane'" variety 31 december 1978 retrieved 31 january 2015xc2xa0^ de laurentiis remaking 1937 john ford film: 'hurricane's' blustery stay in bora bora warga wayne los angeles times (1923-current file) {los angeles calif] 30 july 1978: p1^ sragow michael (june 9 1983) "jan troell: hypnotist on a grand scale" rolling stone (397): 50xc2xa0^ "hurricane (1979)" rotten tomatoes retrieved 31 january 2015xc2xa0^ erickson hal "hurricane (1979)" allmovie retrieved 31 january 2015xc2xa0external links{edit]hurricane (1979 film) on imdbhurricane (1979 film) at rotten tomatoesvtefilms directed by jan troellfiction filmshere is your lifewho saw him die?the emigrantsthe new landzandy's bridebang!hurricaneflight of the eagleil capitano: a swedish requiemhamsunas white as in snoweverlasting momentsthe last sentencedocumentariesland of dreamsa frozen dreamvtenino rotaoperasil cappello di paglia di firenzei due timidiconcertostrombone concertofilm soundtracksromeo and julietthe godfather"speak softly love"the godfather part iithe godfather part iiirelated articleslist of compositions by nino rotalist of film scores by nino rotanino rota discography retrieved from ""categories: english-language films1979 films1970s disaster filmsamerican disaster filmsamerican romantic drama filmsamerican filmsworks about natural disastersfilm scores by nino rotafilms directed by jan troell1970s romantic drama filmsfilms shot in bora borafilms set in american samoafilms set in the 1920sscreenplays by lorenzo semple jrfilms produced by dino de laurentiis navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version languagescatalxc3xa0xd9x81xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cfranxc3xa7aisitalianoxe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9esvenska edit links  this page was last edited on 22 november 2016 at 18:10text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
