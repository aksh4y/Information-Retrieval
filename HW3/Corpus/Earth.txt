periods of many millions of years about 71 of earth's surface is covered with water mostly by oceans{29] the remaining 29 is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes

earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonicswithin the first billion years of earth's history life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the earth's atmosphere and surface leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 41xc2xa0billion years ago since then the combination of earth's distance from the sun physical properties and geological history have allowed life to

english noun most often spelled eorxc3xb0e{39] it has cognates in every germanic language and their proto-germanic root has been reconstructed as erxc3xbexc5x8d in its earliest appearances eorxc3xb0e was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek xcexb3xe1xbfx86 (gxc4x93): the ground{n 7] its soil{n 8] dry land{n 9] the human world{n 10] the surface of the world (including the sea){n 11] and the globe itself{n 12] as with terra and gaia earth was a personified goddess in germanic paganism: the angles were listed by tacitus as among the devotees of nerthus{48] and later norse mythology included jxc3xb6rxc3xb0 a giantess often given as the mother of thor{49]originally earth was written in lowercase and from early middle english its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the earth by early modern english many nouns were capitalized and the earth became (and often remained) the earth particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as earth by analogy with the names of the other planets{39] house styles now vary: oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes "earth" when appearing as a name (eg "earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (eg "the atmosphere of the earth") it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"{50]chronologymain article: history of earthformationartist's impression

a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the sun a nebula contains gas ice grains and dust (including primordial nuclides) according to nebular theory planetesimals formed by accretion with the primordial earth taking

accretion from material loosed from earth after a mars-sized object named theia impacted earth{55] in this scenario the mass of theia was approximately 10 of that of earth{56] it impacted earth with a glancing blow{57] and some of its mass merged with earth between approximately 41 and 7000380000000000000xe2x99xa038xc2xa0bya numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused

utahearth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor the origin of the world's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids protoplanets and comets{58] in this model atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70 of its current luminosity{59] by 7000350000000000000xe2x99xa035xc2xa0bya earth's magnetic field was established which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind{60]a crust formed when the molten outer

resultant molecular oxygen (o2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation formed a protective ozone layer (o3) in the upper atmosphere{71] the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes{72] true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer life colonized earth's surface{73] among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in

hypothesis has been termed "snowball earth" and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity{80] following the cambrian explosion 7002535000000000000xe2x99xa0535xc2xa0mya there have been five major mass extinctions{81] the most recent such event was 7001660000000000000xe2x99xa066xc2xa0mya when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared some small animals such as mammals which then resembled shrews over the past 7001660000000000000xe2x99xa066xc2xa0mys mammalian life has diversified and several million years ago an african ape-like animal such as orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright{82] this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain which allowed the evolution of humans the development of agriculture and then civilization led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today{83]futuremain article: future of earthsee also: global catastrophic

radius{84]{90] earth's fate is less clear as a red giant the sun will lose roughly 30 of its mass so without tidal effects earth will move to an orbit 17xc2xa0au (250xc2xa0millionxc2xa0km; 160xc2xa0millionxc2xa0mi) from the sun when the star reaches its maximum radius most if not all remaining life will be destroyed by the sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5000 times its

of dissolved atmospheric gases which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms{141] sea water has an important influence on the world's climate with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir{142] shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts such as the el nixc3xb1o-southern oscillation{143]atmospheremain article: atmosphere of

between 8xc2xa0km at the poles to 17xc2xa0km at the equator with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors{144]earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere oxygenic

indirectly the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric o2 into o3 the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation permitting life on land{145] other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor providing useful gases causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface and moderating temperature{146] this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground thereby raising the average temperature water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere without this heat-retention effect the average surface temperature would be xe2x88x9218xc2xa0xc2xb0c in contrast to the current +15xc2xa0xc2xb0c{147] and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form{148] in may 2017 glints of light seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away were

with a pressure ridge near mount discovery antarctica november 2013massive clouds above the mojave desert february 2016earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11xc2xa0km (68xc2xa0mi) of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher-density air the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy{151]the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30xc2xb0 latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30xc2xb0 and 60xc2xb0{152] ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions{153]water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation{151] most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region{154]the amount of solar energy reaching earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 04xc2xa0xc2xb0c (07xc2xa0xc2xb0f) per degree of latitude from the equator{155] earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the tropical (or equatorial) subtropical temperate and polar climates{156]this latitudinal rule has several anomalies:proximity to oceans moderates the climate for example the scandinavian peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern canadathe wind enables this moderating effect the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side in the northern hemisphere the prevailing wind is west-to-east and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts this is seen in eastern north america and western europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean{157] in the southern hemisphere the prevailing wind is east-to-west and the eastern coasts are milderthe distance from the earth to the sun varies the earth is closest to the sun (at perihelion) in january which is summer in the southern hemisphere it is furthest away (at aphelion) in july which is summer in the northern hemisphere and only 9355 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 23xc2xa0xc2xb0c (4xc2xa0xc2xb0f) warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions{158]the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air densitythe commonly used kxc3xb6ppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics arid humid middle latitudes continental and cold polar) which are further divided into more specific subtypes{152] the kxc3xb6ppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitationthe highest air temperature ever measured on earth was 567xc2xa0xc2xb0c (1341xc2xa0xc2xb0f) in furnace creek california in death valley in 1913{159] the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was xe2x88x92892xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x921286xc2xa0xc2xb0f) at vostok station in 1983{160] but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as xe2x88x92947xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x921385xc2xa0xc2xb0f) in east antarctica{161] these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earthupper atmospherethis view from orbit shows the full moon partially obscured by earth's atmosphereabove the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere mesosphere and thermosphere{146] each layer has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind{162] within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the kxc3xa1rmxc3xa1n line defined as 100xc2xa0km above earth's surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space{163]thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth's gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases{164] the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere{165] hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth{166] in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere{167]gravitational fieldmain article: gravity of earthearth's gravity measured by nasa's grace mission showing deviations

due to the distribution of mass within the earth near the earth's surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 98xc2xa0ms2 (32xc2xa0fts2) local differences in topography geology and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in the earth's gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies{168]magnetic fieldmain article: earth's magnetic fieldthe main part of earth's magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy the field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to earth's surface where it is approximately a dipole the poles of the dipole are located close to earth's geographic poles at the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 305 xc3x97 10xe2x88x925 t with global magnetic dipole moment of 791 xc3x97 1015 t m3{169] the convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700000 years ago{170]{171]magnetospheremain article: magnetosphereschematic of earth's magnetosphere the solar wind flows from left to rightthe extent of earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about 10 earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail{172] because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind{173] charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates;{174]{175] the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field{176] and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere{172]{177]during magnetic storms and substorms charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into earth's ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora{178]orbit and rotationrotationmain article: earth's rotationearth's rotation imaged by dscovr epic on 29 may 2016 a few

axis and plane of orbitthe axial tilt of the earth is approximately 23439281xc2xb0{2] with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the celestial poles due to earth's axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter in northern temperate latitudes the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice and sets north of true west reversing in the winter the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true westabove the arctic circle an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a polar night in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole

southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped{190]the angle of earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight irregular motion with a main period of 186xc2xa0years{191] the orientation (rather than the angle) of earth's axis also changes over time precessing around in a complete circle over each 25800xc2xa0year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth's equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across earth's surface this polar motion has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a 14-month cycle called the chandler wobble earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation{192]in modern times earth's perihelion occurs around 3 january and its aphelion around 4 july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles the changing earthxe2x80x93sun distance causes an increase of about 69{n 20] in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere{193]a study from 2016 suggested that planet nine tilted all solar system planets including earth's by about 6 degrees{194]habitabilitythe

is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations thereby avoiding armed conflict{213] the un serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law when the consensus of the membership permits it provides a mechanism for armed intervention{214]the first human to orbit earth was yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961{215] in total about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 july 2010{update] and of these twelve have walked on the moon{216]{217]{218] normally the only humans in space are those on the international space station the station's crew made up of six people is usually replaced every six months{219] the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is

article: moonthe moon is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like natural satellite with a diameter about one-quarter of earth's it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons" after earth'sthe gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminatordetails of the earthxe2x80x93moon system showing the radius of each object and the earthxe2x80x93moon barycenter the moon's axis is located by cassini's third lawdue to their tidal

23xc2xa0xc2xb5syrxe2x80x94add up to significant changes{221] during the devonian period for example (approximately 7002410000000000000xe2x99xa0410xc2xa0mya) there were 400 days in a year with each day lasting 218 hours{222]the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon{28] some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth's equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years as appears to be the case for mars{223]viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun the angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because although the sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the moon's it is also 400 times more distant{186] this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earththe most widely accepted theory of the moon's origin the giant-impact hypothesis states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains (among other things) the moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth's crust{224]asteroids and artificial satellitesearth has at least five co-orbital asteroids including 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29{225]{226] a trojan asteroid

earthxe2x80x93moon system roughly every twenty years during these approaches it can orbit earth for brief periods of time{229]as of june 2016{update] there were 1419 operational human-made satellites orbiting earth{5] there are also inoperative satellites including vanguard 1 the oldest satellite currently in orbit and over 16000 pieces of tracked space debris{n 3] earth's largest artificial

consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle {230] representing the four corners of the worldhuman cultures have developed many views of the planet earth is sometimes personified as a deity in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity{231] and by the mid-20th century the gaia principle compared earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability{232]{233]{234] creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities{231]scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet in the west belief in a flat earth{235] was displaced by the idea of spherical earth credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc{236] earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object comparable to the other planets in the solar system{237] due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized earth's age was at least many millions of years{238]lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20 million and 400xc2xa0million years in 1864 sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth's age was established proving the planet to be billions of years old{239]{240] the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit and especially with photographs of earth returned by the apollo
