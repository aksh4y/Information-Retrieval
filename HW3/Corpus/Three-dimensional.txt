dayatiyahgromov geometry portalvtethree-dimensional space (also: 3-space or rarely tri-dimensional space) is a geometric setting in which three values (called parameters) are required to determine the position of an element (ie point) this is the informal meaning of the term dimensionin physics and mathematics a sequence of n numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space when n = 3 the set of all such locations is called three-dimensional euclidean space it is commonly represented by the symbol xe2x84x9d3 this serves as a three-parameter model of the physical universe (that is the spatial part without considering time) in which all known matter exists however this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called 3-manifolds in this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions (coordinates) any three directions can be chosen provided that vectors in these directions do not all lie in the same 2-space (plane) furthermore in this case these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms width height depth and breadthcontents1 in euclidean geometry11 coordinate

external linksin euclidean geometry{edit]coordinate systems{edit]main article: coordinate systemin mathematics analytic geometry (also called cartesian geometry) describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross they are usually labeled x y and z relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes{1]other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods see euclidean spacebelow are images of the above-mentioned systemscartesian coordinate systemcylindrical coordinate systemspherical coordinate systemlines and planes{edit]two distinct points always determine a (straight) line three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire spacetwo distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common planetwo distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel (do not meet) three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallela line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given linea hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersectionvarignon's theorem states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in xe2x84x9d3 form a parallelogram and so are coplanarspheres and balls{edit]main article: spherea two-dimensional perspective projection of a spherea sphere in 3-space (also called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object) consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance r from a central point p the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball (or more precisely a 3-ball) the volume of the ball is given byv=43xcfx80r3{displaystyle v={frac {4}{3}}pi r^{3}}another type of sphere arises from a 4-ball whose three-dimensional surface is the 3-sphere: points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space xe2x84x9d4 if a point has coordinates p(x y z w) then x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 1 characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the originpolytopes{edit]main article: polyhedronin three

generated by revolving a plane curve about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the axis is a circlesimple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex (apex) the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular cylinderquadric surfaces{edit]main article: quadric surfacein analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namelyax2+by2+cz2+fxy+gyz+hxz+jx+ky+lz+m=0{displaystyle ax^{2}+by^{2}+cz^{2}+fxy+gyz+hxz+jx+ky+lz+m=0}where a b c f g h j k l and m are real numbers and not all of a b c f g and h are zero is called a quadric surface{2]there are six types of non-degenerate quadric surfaces:ellipsoidhyperboloid of one sheethyperboloid of two sheetselliptic coneelliptic paraboloidhyperbolic paraboloidthe degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder (a surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane xcfx80 and all the lines of xe2x84x9d3 through that conic that are normal to xcfx80){2] elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as wellboth the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family{3] each family is called a regulusin linear algebra{edit]another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectorsdot product angle and length{edit]main article: dot producta vector

product{edit]main article: cross productthe cross product or vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space and is denoted by the symbol xc3x97 the cross product a xc3x97 b of the vectors a and b is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics physics and engineeringthe space and product form an algebra over a field which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracketone can in n dimensions take the product of n xe2x88x92 1 vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions{6]the
