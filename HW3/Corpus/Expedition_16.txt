peggy whitson launched on 10 october 2007 aboard soyuz tma-11 and were joined by spaceflight participant sheikh muszaphar shukor the first malaysian in space{3]{4]expedition 15 flight engineer clayton anderson did not land with the soyuz tma-10 so he was considered part of expedition 16 for the few weeks prior to the arrival of sts-120{5] sts-120 launched on 23 october docked on 25 october and replaced anderson with new flight engineer daniel tani{1]{6]{7] following docking the soyuz seat liners for anderson and tani were swapped and anderson became part of the sts-120 crew lxc3xa9opold eyharts who came aboard during sts-122 joined the mission on 9 february 2008 replacing tani{3]{8] the crew was then joined by garrett reisman who was launched aboard endeavour with sts-123 on 11 march 2008 replacing eyharts reisman joined expedition 16 in progress and was a part of expedition 17 as well upon reentry the astronaut's soyuz tma-11 spacecraft suffered a minor malfunction causing the craft to follow a very steep ballistic descent as a result the crew experienced forces up to 10 g ending up about 260 miles (418xc2xa0km) west of the targeted landing site roscosmos reported all three crew members were doing just fine and in good health{9]contents1 crew2 backup crew3 mission details31 sts-12032 configuration of harmony33 eva milestone34 sts-12235 sts-12336 atv jules-verne37 soyuz

a flight engineer{5] whitson was the first female commander of an iss expedition{5]{10] and with sts-120 commanded by female astronaut pamela melroy it marked the first time that two female mission commanders were in orbit simultaneously{11]{12]{13] on her first expedition whitson implemented a "friday night movie night" to help the crew wind down at the end of the week and plans to keep the custom of adding some levity to the station going for expedition 16{14] anderson incorporated some entertainment into the daily planning conference with the ground quizzing the ground team on a wide variety of subjects and michael lopez-alegria did a similar activity with movie and music trivia{14]sts-120{edit]the first major objective of the increment was accomplished successfully on 26 october when the crew of sts-120 delivered the harmony module and attached it to a temporary location on the unity module{15]{16] the new addition added over 2500 cubic feet (71xc2xa0m3) to the station's living volume{17] the joint crews also moved the p6 truss and relocated it from its position on top of the station to its final port-side position during the third of four spacewalksconfiguration of harmony{edit]expedition commander peggy whitson during the increment's third eva behind whitson is the destiny laboratory module and harmonycrew members pose for a christmas photo in zvezda (iss module)following the departure of sts-120 a series of extra-vehicular activity (eva) and robotic activities were carried out to move the pressurized mating adapter (pma-2) from the end of the destiny laboratory to the end of harmony whitson and malenchenko carried out the increment's first eva on 9 november that prepared the docking port for relocation{18] on 12 november whitson and tani used the station's mobile servicing system (robotic arm) to detach the docking port and relocated it to the forward port of harmony{19] on 14 november the tani and whitson again used the robotic arm and moved harmony from its temporary location to its permanent location on the forward port of destiny{20]on 20 november whitson and tani completed the second eva for the increment a 7-hour 16-minute spacewalk to outfit the harmony node in its new position all tasks were accomplished and three get-ahead tasks were performed{21] on 24 november whitson and tani completed the third eva for the increment a 7-hour 4 minute spacewalk to complete the outfitting of harmony all task were accomplished and photographic inspection of the starboard solar alpha rotary joint (sarj) was performed as well as some iss maintenance get-ahead tasks{22]{23]eva milestone{edit]on 18 december 2007 during the fourth spacewalk of expedition 16 to inspect the s4 starboard solar alpha rotary joint (sarj) the ground team in mission control informed whitson that she had become the female astronaut with the most cumulative eva time in nasa history as well as the most evas with her fifth eva three hours and 37 minutes into the spacewalk whitson surpassed nasa astronaut sunita williams with a total time at that point of 29 hours and 18 minutes{24]{25] at the completion of whitson's fifth eva the 100th in support of iss assembly and maintenance whitson's cumulative eva time became 32 hours and 36 minutes which placed her in 20th place for total eva time{25]sts-122{edit]sts-122 delivered columbus and replaced dan
