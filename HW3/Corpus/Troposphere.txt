b'troposphere - wikipedia tropospherefrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchspace shuttle endeavour silhouetted against the atmosphere the orange layer is the troposphere the white layer is the stratosphere and the blue layer is the mesosphere{1] (the shuttle is actually orbiting at an altitude of more than 320xc2xa0km (200xc2xa0mi) far above all three layers)the troposphere is the lowest layer of earth's atmosphere and is also where nearly all weather conditions take place it contains approximately 75 of the atmosphere's mass and 99 of the total mass of water vapor and aerosols{2] the average depths of the troposphere are 20xc2xa0km (12xc2xa0mi) in the tropics 17xc2xa0km (11xc2xa0mi) in the mid latitudes and 7xc2xa0km (43xc2xa0mi) in the polar regions in winter the lowest part of the troposphere where friction with the earth's surface influences air flow is the planetary boundary layer this layer is typically a few hundred meters to 2xc2xa0km (12xc2xa0mi) deep depending on the landform and time of day atop the troposphere is the tropopause which is the border between the troposphere and stratosphere the tropopause is an inversion layer where the air temperature ceases to decrease with height and remains constant through its thickness{3]the word troposphere derives from the greek: tropos for "turn turn toward trope" and "-sphere" (as in the earth) reflecting the fact that rotational turbulent mixing plays an important role in the troposphere's structure and behaviour most of the phenomena associated with day-to-day weather occur in the troposphere{3]diagram showing the five primary layers of the earth's atmosphere: exosphere thermosphere mesosphere stratosphere and troposphere the layers are to scale from earth's surface to

of earth's troposphere from an airplanecomposition{edit]by volume dry air contains 7808 nitrogen 2095 oxygen 093 argon 004 carbon dioxide and small amounts of other gases air also contains a variable amount of water vapor except for the water vapor content the composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform the source of water vapor is at the earth's surface through the process of evaporation the temperature of the troposphere decreases with altitude and saturation vapor pressure decreases strongly as temperature drops hence the amount of water vapor that can exist in the atmosphere decreases strongly with altitude and the proportion of water vapor is normally greatest near the surface of the earthpressure{edit]the pressure of the atmosphere is maximum at sea level and decreases with altitude this is because the atmosphere is very nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium so that the pressure is equal to the weight of air above a given point the change in pressure with altitude can be equated to the density with the hydrostatic equation{4]dpdz=xe2x88x92xcfx81gn=xe2x88x92mpgnrt{displaystyle {frac {dp}{dz}}=-rho g_{n}=-{frac {mpg_{n}}{rt}}}where:gn is the standard gravityxcfx81 is the densityz is the altitudep is the pressurer is the gas constantt is the thermodynamic (absolute) temperaturem is the molar masssince temperature in principle also depends on altitude one needs a second equation to determine the pressure as a function of altitude as discussed in the next sectiontemperature{edit]this image shows the temperature trend in the middle troposphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between january 1979 and december 2005 the middle troposphere is centered around 5 kilometers above the surface oranges and yellows dominate the troposphere image indicating that the air nearest the earth's surface warmed during the periodsource: {1]the temperature of the troposphere generally decreases as altitude increases the rate at which the temperature decreases xe2x88x92dtdz{displaystyle -dtdz} is called the environmental lapse rate (elr) the elr is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height the elr assumes that the air is perfectly still ie that there is no mixing of the layers of air from vertical convection nor winds that would create turbulence and hence mixing of the layers of air the reason for this temperature difference is that the ground absorbs most of the sun's energy which then heats the lower levels of the atmosphere with which it is in contact meanwhile the radiation of heat at the top of the atmosphere results in the cooling of that part of the atmosphereenvironmental lapse rate (elr)altitude regionlapse ratelapse

for the effect of the expansion of dry air as it rises in the atmosphere and wet adiabatic lapse rates includes the effect of the condensation of water vapor on the lapse ratewhen a parcel of air rises it expands because the pressure is lower at higher altitudes as the air parcel expands it pushes the surrounding air outward transferring energy in the form of work from that parcel to the atmosphere as energy transfer to a parcel of air by way of heat is very slow it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of heat with the environment such a process is called an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat) since the rising parcel of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere to make up for the loss the parcel of air is losing energy which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel the reverse of course will be true for a parcel of air that is sinking and is being compressed{3]since the process of compression and expansion of an air parcel can be considered reversible and no energy is transferred into or out of the parcel such a process is considered isentropic meaning that there is no change in entropy as the air parcel rises and falls ds=0{displaystyle ds=0} since the heat exchanged dq=0{displaystyle dq=0} is related to the entropy change ds{displaystyle ds} by dq=tds{displaystyle dq=tds} the equation governing the temperature as a function of height for a thoroughly mixed atmosphere isdsdz=0{displaystyle {frac {ds}{dz}}=0}where s is the entropy the above equation states that the entropy of the atmosphere does not change with height the rate at which temperature decreases with height under such conditions is called the adiabatic lapse ratefor dry air which is approximately an ideal gas we can proceed further the adiabatic equation for an ideal gas is {5]p(z)t(z)xe2x88x92xcexb3xcexb3xe2x88x921=constant{displaystyle p(z)t(z)^{-{frac {gamma }{gamma -1}}}=constant}where xcexb3{displaystyle gamma } is the heat capacity ratio (xcexb3{displaystyle gamma }=75 for air) combining with the equation for the pressure one arrives at the dry adiabatic lapse rate{6]dtdz=xe2x88x92mgrxcexb3xe2x88x921xcexb3=xe2x88x9298xe2x88x98ckm{displaystyle {frac {dt}{dz}}=-{frac {mg}{r}}{frac {gamma -1}{gamma }}=-98^{circ }mathrm {c} mathrm {km} }if the air contains water vapor then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense and the behavior is no longer that of an ideal gas if the air is at the saturated vapor pressure then the rate at which temperature drops with height is called the saturated adiabatic lapse rate more generally the actual rate at which the temperature drops with altitude is called the environmental lapse rate in the troposphere the average environmental lapse rate is a drop of about 65xc2xa0xc2xb0c for every 1xc2xa0km (1000 meters) in increased height{3]the environmental lapse rate (the actual rate at which temperature drops with height dtdz{displaystyle dtdz}) is not usually equal to the adiabatic lapse rate (or correspondingly dsdzxe2x89xa00{displaystyle dsdzeq 0}) if the upper air is warmer than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate (dsdz>0{displaystyle dsdz>0}) then when a parcel of air rises and expands it will arrive at the new height at a lower temperature than its surroundings in this case the air parcel is denser than its surroundings so it sinks back to its original height and the air is stable against being lifted if on the contrary the upper air is cooler than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate then when the air parcel rises to its new height it will have a higher temperature and a lower density than its surroundings and will continue to accelerate upward{3]{4]the troposphere is heated from below by latent heat longwave radiation and sensible heat surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occurs in the tropics at middle latitudes tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 15xc2xa0xc2xb0c at sea level to about xe2x88x9255xc2xa0xc2xb0c at the tropopause at the poles tropospheric temperature only decreases from an average of 0xc2xa0xc2xb0c at sea level to about xe2x88x9245xc2xa0xc2xb0c at the tropopause at the equator tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 20xc2xa0xc2xb0c at sea level to about xe2x88x9270 to xe2x88x9275xc2xa0xc2xb0c at the tropopause the troposphere is thinner at the poles and thicker at the equator the average thickness of the tropical tropopause is roughly 7 kilometers greater than the average tropopause thickness at the poles{7]tropopause{edit]main article: tropopausethe tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the stratospheremeasuring the temperature change with height through the troposphere and the stratosphere identifies the location of the tropopause in the troposphere temperature decreases with altitude in the stratosphere however the temperature remains constant for a while and then increases with altitude the region of the atmosphere where the lapse rate changes from positive (in the troposphere) to negative (in the stratosphere) is defined as the tropopause{3] thus the tropopause is an inversion layer and there is little mixing between the two layers of the atmosphereatmospheric flow{edit]the flow of the atmosphere generally moves in a west to east direction this however can often become interrupted creating a more north to south or south to north flow these scenarios are often described in meteorology as zonal or meridional these terms however tend to be used in reference to localised areas of atmosphere (at a synoptic scale) a fuller explanation of the flow of atmosphere around the earth as a whole can be found in the three-cell modelzonal flow{edit]a zonal flow regime note the dominant west-to-east flow as shown in the 500 hpa height patterna zonal flow regime is the meteorological term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the earth's latitude lines with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow{8] the use of the word "zone" refers to the flow being along the earth's latitudinal "zones" this pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flowmeridional flow{edit]meridional flow pattern of october 23 2003 note the amplified troughs and ridges in this 500 hpa height patternwhen the zonal flow buckles the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal (or meridional) direction and thus the term "meridional flow" arises meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs of low pressure and ridges of high pressure with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow{9]three-cell model{edit]main article: atmospheric circulationatmospheric circulation shown with three large cellsthe three cells model of the atmosphere attempts to describe the actual flow of the earth's atmosphere as a whole it divides the earth into the tropical (hadley cell) mid latitude (ferrel cell) and polar (polar cell) regions to describe energy flow and global atmospheric circulation (mass flow) its fundamental principle is that of balance xe2x80x93 the energy that the earth absorbs from the sun each year is equal to that which it loses to space by radiation this overall earth energy balance however does not apply in each latitude due to the varying strength of the sun in each "cell" as a result of the tilt of the earth's axis in relation to its orbit the result is a circulation of the atmosphere that transports warm air poleward from the tropics and cold air equatorward from the poles the effect of the three cells is the tendency to even out the heat and moisture in the earth's atmosphere around the planet{10]synoptic scale observations and concepts{edit]forcing{edit]forcing is a term used by meteorologists to describe the situation where a change or an event in one part of the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere it is usually used to describe connections between upper middle or lower levels (such as upper-level divergence causing lower level convergence in cyclone formation) but also be to describe such connections over lateral distance rather than height alone in some respects teleconnections could be considered a type of forcingdivergence and convergence{edit]an area of convergence is one in which the total mass of air is increasing with time resulting in an increase in pressure at locations below the convergence level (recall that atmospheric pressure is just the total weight of air above a given point) divergence is the opposite of convergence xe2x80x93 an area where the total mass of air is decreasing with time resulting in falling pressure in regions below the area of divergence where divergence is occurring in the upper atmosphere there will be air coming in to try to balance the net loss of mass (this is called the principle of mass conservation) and there is a resulting upward motion (positive vertical velocity) another way to state this is to say that regions of upper air divergence are conducive to lower level convergence cyclone formation and positive vertical velocity therefore identifying regions of upper air divergence is an important step in forecasting the formation of a surface low pressure
