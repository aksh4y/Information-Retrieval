west virginia and washington dc to its south and west; pennsylvania to its north; and delaware to its east the state's largest city is baltimore and its capital is annapolis among its occasional nicknames are old line state the free state and the chesapeake bay state the state is named after the english queen henrietta maria of france{10]one of the original thirteen colonies maryland is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in america{11]{12] when it was formed by george calvert in the early 17th century as an intended refuge for persecuted catholics from england{11]{12]{13] george calvert was the first lord of baltimore and the first english proprietor of the then-maryland colonial grant{11]{12] maryland was the seventh state to ratify the united states constitution and played a pivotal role in the founding of washington dc which was established on land donated by the statemaryland is one of the smallest us states in terms of area as well as one of the most densely populated with around six million residents as of 2009{update] maryland had the highest median household income of any state owing in large part to its close proximity to the nation's capital and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing services and biotechnology{14]contents1 geography11 description12 geology13 flora14 fauna15 environment16 climate161

reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed (april 2017) (learn how and when to remove this template message)maryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders contributing to its nickname america in miniature it ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the chesapeake bay to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the piedmont region and pine groves in the maryland mountains to the westwestern maryland: known for its heavily forested mountains a panoramic view of deep creek lake and the surrounding appalachian mountains in garrett countygreat falls on the potomac rivermaryland is bounded on its north by pennsylvania on its west by west virginia on its east by delaware and the atlantic ocean and on its south across the potomac river by west virginia and virginia the mid-portion of this border is interrupted by washington dc which sits on land that was originally part of montgomery and prince george's counties and including the town of georgetown maryland this land was ceded to the united states federal government in 1790 to form the district of columbia (the commonwealth of virginia gave land south of the potomac including the town of alexandria virginia however virginia retroceded its portion in 1846) the chesapeake bay nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the eastern shoretypical freshwater river above the tidal zone the patapsco river includes the famous thomas viaduct and is part of the patapsco valley state park later the river forms the inner harbor as it empties into the chesapeake baytypical brackish tidal river sunset over a marsh at cardinal cove on the patuxent rivertidal wetlands of the chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the united states and the largest water feature in marylandmost of the state's waterways are part of the chesapeake bay watershed with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western garrett county (drained by the youghiogheny river as part of the watershed of the mississippi river) the eastern half of worcester county (which drains into maryland's atlantic coastal bays) and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the delaware river watershed) so prominent is the chesapeake in maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the "bay state" a nickname that has been used by massachusetts for decadesthe highest point in maryland with an elevation of 3360 feet (1020xc2xa0m) is hoye crest on backbone mountain in the southwest corner of garrett county near the border with west virginia and near the headwaters of the north branch of the potomac river close to the small town of hancock in western maryland about two-thirds of the way across the state there are 183 miles (295xc2xa0km) between its borders this geographical curiosity makes maryland the narrowest state{citation needed] bordered by the masonxe2x80x93dixon line to the north and the northwards-arching potomac river to the southportions of maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions for example the delmarva peninsula is composed of the eastern shore counties of maryland the entire state of delaware and the two counties that make up the eastern shore of virginia whereas the westernmost counties of maryland are considered part of appalachia much of the baltimorexe2x80x93washington corridor lies just south of the piedmont in the coastal plain{16] though it straddles the border between the two regionsgeology{edit]earthquakes in maryland are infrequent and small due to the state's distance from seismicearthquake zones{17]{18] the m58 virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout maryland buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily{citation needed]the lack of any glacial history accounts for the scarcity of maryland's natural lakes yet the oft-repeated claim{19] that maryland is the only state without natural lakes is not true laurel oxbow lake is an over one-hundred-year-old 55-acre natural lake two miles north of maryland city{20]{21]{22] and adjacent to russett "chews lake" is a seven-acre natural lake two miles south-southeast of upper marlboro{23] there are numerous man-made lakes the largest of them being the deep creek lake a reservoir in garrett county in westernmost marylandmaryland has shale formations containing natural gas where fracking is theoretically possible{24]flora{edit]black-eyed susans the state flower grow throughout much of the state{25]as is typical of states on the east coast maryland's plant life is abundant and healthy a good dose of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic wye oak a huge example of white oak the state tree which can grow in excess of 70 feet (21xc2xa0m) tallmiddle atlantic coastal forests typical of the southeastern atlantic coastal plain grow around chesapeake bay and on the delmarva peninsula moving west a mixture of northeastern coastal forests and southeastern mixed forests cover the central part of the state the appalachian mountains of western maryland are home to appalachian-blue ridge forests these give way to appalachian mixed mesophytic forests near the west virginia border{26]mature trachycarpus fortunei in solomons marylandmany foreign species are cultivated in the state some as ornamentals others as novelty species included among these are the crape myrtle italian cypress southern magnolia live oak in the warmer parts of the state{27] and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state{28] usda plant hardiness zones in the state range from zones 5 and 6 in the extreme western part of the state to zone 7 in the central part and zone 8 around the southern part of the coast the bay area and parts of metropolitan baltimore{29] invasive plant species such as kudzu tree of heaven multiflora rose and japanese stiltgrass stifle growth of endemic plant life{30] maryland's state flower the black-eyed susan grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state the state insect the baltimore checkerspot butterfly is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range{31] 435 species of birds have been reported from maryland{32]fauna{edit]the state harbors a great number of white tailed deer especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state and overpopulation can become a problem from year to year mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include black bears{33] bobcats{34] foxes coyotes{35] raccoons and otters{33]on maryland's atlantic coastal islands: a feral chincoteague pony on assateaguethere is a population of rare wild (feral) horses found on assateague island{36] they are believed to be descended from horses who escaped from shipwrecks{36] every year during the last week of july they are captured and waded across a shallow bay for sale at chincoteague virginia a conservation technique which ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses{36] the ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book misty of chincoteaguethe purebred chesapeake bay retriever dog was bred specifically for water sports hunting and search and rescue in the chesapeake area{37] in 1878 the chesapeake bay retriever was the first individual retriever breed recognized by the american kennel club{37] and was later adopted by the university of maryland baltimore county as their mascotmaryland's reptile and amphibian population includes the diamondback terrapin turtle which was adopted as the mascot of university of maryland college park the state is part of the territory of the baltimore oriole which is the official state bird and mascot of the mlb team the baltimore orioles{38]environment{edit]maryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the chesapeake bay the bay's aquatic life and seafood industry have been threatened by development and by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay{39]{40]in 2007 forbescom rated maryland as the fifth "greenest" state in the country behind three of the pacific states and vermont maryland ranks 40th in total energy consumption nationwide and it managed less toxic waste per capita than all but six states in 2005{41] in april 2007 maryland joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi)xe2x80x94a regional initiative formed by all of the northeastern states washington dc and three canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions{citation needed] in march 2017 maryland became the first state with proven gas reserves to ban fracking by passing a law against it vermont has such a law but no shale gas and new york has such a ban though it was made by executive order{24]climate{edit]a map of kxc3xb6ppen climate types in marylandwinter in baltimore lancaster street fells pointmaryland has a wide array of climates due to local variances in elevation proximity to water and protection from colder weather due to downslope windsthe eastern half of marylandxe2x80x94which includes the cities of ocean city salisbury annapolis and the southern and eastern suburbs of washington dc and baltimorexe2x80x94lies on the atlantic coastal plain with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil this region has a humid subtropical climate (kxc3xb6ppen cfa) with hot humid summers and a short mild to cool winter; it falls under usda hardiness zone 8a{29]the piedmont regionxe2x80x94which includes northern and western greater baltimore westminster gaithersburg frederick and hagerstownxe2x80x94has average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding 20 inches (51xc2xa0cm) and as part of usda hardiness zones 7b and 7a{29] temperatures below 10xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x9212xc2xa0xc2xb0c) are less rare from the cumberland valley on westward the climate begins to transition to a humid continental climate (kxc3xb6ppen dfa)in western maryland the higher elevations of allegany and garrett countiesxe2x80x94including the cities of cumberland frostburg and oaklandxe2x80x94display more characteristics of the humid continental zone due in part to elevation they fall under usda hardiness zones 6b and below{29]precipitation{edit]precipitation in the state is characteristic of the east coast annual rainfall ranges from 35 to 45 inches (890 to 1140xc2xa0mm) with more in higher elevations nearly every part of maryland receives 35xe2x80x9345 inches (89xe2x80x93114xc2xa0mm) per month of rain average annual snowfall varies from 9 inches (23xc2xa0cm) in the coastal areas to over 100 inches (250xc2xa0cm) in the western mountains of the state{42]hurricanes and tornadoes{edit]because of its location near the atlantic coast maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones although the delmarva peninsula and the outer banks of north carolina provide a large buffer such that strikes from major hurricanes (category 3 or above) occur infrequently more often maryland gets the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its energy maryland averages around 30xe2x80x9340 days of thunderstorms a year and averages around six tornado strikes annually{43]monthly average high and low temperatures

catholic george calvert 1st lord baltimore (1579xe2x80x931632) sought a charter from king charles i for the territory between massachusetts to the north and virginia to the immediate south{54] after george calvert died in april 1632 the charter was granted to his son cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore (1605xe2x80x931675) on june 20 1632 officially the new "maryland colony" was named in honor of henrietta maria of france wife of charles i of england{55] alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632 his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someone's middle name many agree{who?] that since the original capital of maryland was st mary's city on the north shore of the potomac riverxc2xa0xe2x80x93 and the county surrounding it the first erectedcreated in the province{56] was named st mary's countyxc2xa0xe2x80x93 maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of the seal reads terrxc3x86 marixc3x86{57] which translates in latin as "land of mary" instead of terrxc3x86 maria which would acknowledge henrietta's middle name{58]lord baltimore's first settlers arrived in the new colony in march 1634 with his younger brother leonard calvert (1606xe2x80x931647) as first provincial governor of maryland they made their first permanent settlement at st mary's city in what is now st mary's county they purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region who was eager to establish trade st mary's became the first capital of maryland and remained so for 60 years until 1695 more settlers soon followed their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable however given the incidence of malaria yellow fever and typhoid life expectancy in maryland was about 10 years less than in new england{59]persecution of catholics{edit]see also: plundering timemaryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of england's roman catholic minority{60] in 1642 a number of puritans left virginia for maryland and founded providence (now called annapolis) on the western shore of the upper chesapeake bay{61] a dispute with traders from virginia over kent island in the chesapeake led to armed conflict in 1644 william claiborne a puritan seized kent island while his associate the pro-parliament puritan richard ingle took over st mary's{62] both used religion as a tool to gain popular support the two years from 1644xe2x80x931646 that claiborne and his puritan associates held sway were known as "the plundering time" they captured jesuit priests imprisoned them then sent them back to englandin 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st mary's city and restored order the house of delegates passed the "act concerning religion" in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian christians{59]in 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government "protestants swept the catholics out of the legislature and religious strife returned"{59] the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the "plundering time" mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the calvert family and lord baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the toleration actafter england's "glorious revolution" of 1688 maryland outlawed catholicism this lasted until after the american revolutionary war (1775xe2x80x931783) wealthy catholic planters built chapels on their land

north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvania's southern border as identical to maryland's northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colony's capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681a compromise proposed by charles ii in 1682 was undermined by penn's receiving the additional grant of what is now delaware{63] penn successfully argued that the maryland charter entitled lord baltimore only to unsettled lands and dutch settlement in delaware predated his charter the dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century carried on by the descendants of william penn and lord baltimorexc2xa0xe2x80x94 the calvert family which controlled maryland and the penn family which controlled pennsylvania{63]the border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresap's war in the 1730s hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737 the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732{63]negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760 the agreement defined the border between maryland and pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the masonxe2x80x93dixon line maryland's border with delaware was based on a transpeninsular line and the twelve-mile circle around new castle{63]18th century{edit]main article: maryland in the american revolutionmost of the english colonists arrived in maryland as indentured servants and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage{64] in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together and formed unions mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem by which children took the social status of their mothers a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies following virginia in 1662 during the colonial era families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and african men{65]comte du bourg (left) and baron von closen on their way to yorktown september 1781many of the free black families migrated to delaware where land was cheaper{65] as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england planters in maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened the economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity cropmaryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution on february 2 1781 maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the articles of confederation which brought into being the united states as a united sovereign and national state it also became the seventh state admitted to the us after ratifying the new constitution in december 1790 maryland donated land selected by president george washington to the federal government for the creation of the

progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms in a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908 reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from "assisting" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols which discouraged the illiterate from participating these measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks blacks resisted such efforts with suffrage groups conducting voter education blacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns{71] disfranchising bills in 1905 1907 and 1911 were rebuffed in large part because of black opposition blacks comprised 20 of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15 and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants{71]the progressive era also brought reforms in working conditions for maryland's labor force in 1902 the state regulated conditions in mines; outlawed child laborers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first workers' compensation law the workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910the great baltimore fire of 1904 burned over 30 hours destroying 1526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks more than 1231
