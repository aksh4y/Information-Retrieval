nameslist of retired south pacific cyclone namesoutline of tropical cyclonestropical cyclones portalvtethe eye is a region of mostly calm weather at the center of strong tropical cyclones the eye of a storm is a roughly circular area typically 30xe2x80x9365xc2xa0km (20xe2x80x9340xc2xa0miles) in diameter it is surrounded by the eyewall a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur the cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye and can be as much as 15 percent lower than the pressure outside the storm{1]in strong tropical cyclones the eye is characterized by light winds and clear skies surrounded on all sides by a towering symmetric eyewall in weaker tropical cyclones the eye is less well defined and can be covered by the central dense overcast an area of high thick clouds that show up brightly on satellite imagery weaker or disorganized storms may also feature an eyewall that does not completely encircle the eye or have an eye that features heavy rain in all storms however the eye is the location of the storm's minimum barometric pressurexe2x80x94where the atmospheric pressure at sea level is the lowest{1]{2]contents1 structure2

air flow in and around the eyea typical tropical cyclone will have an eye of approximately 30xe2x80x9365xc2xa0km (20xe2x80x9340xc2xa0mi) across usually situated at the geometric center of the storm the eye may be clear or have spotty low clouds (a clear eye) it may be filled with low- and mid-level clouds (a filled eye) or it may be obscured by the central dense overcast there is however very little wind and rain especially near the center this is in stark contrast to conditions in the eyewall which contains the storm's strongest winds{3] due to the mechanics of a tropical cyclone the eye and the air directly above it are warmer than their surroundings{4]while normally quite symmetric eyes can be oblong and irregular especially in weakening storms a large ragged eye is a non-circular eye which appears fragmented and is an indicator of a weak or weakening tropical cyclone an open eye is an eye which can be circular but the eyewall does not completely encircle the eye also indicating a weakening moisture-deprived cyclone both of these observations are used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones via dvorak analysis{5] eyewalls are typically circular; however distinctly polygonal shapes ranging from triangles to hexagons occasionally occur{6]while typical mature storms have eyes that are a few dozen miles across rapidly intensifying storms can develop an extremely small clear and circular eye sometimes referred to as a pinhole eye storms with pinhole eyes are prone to large fluctuations in intensity and provide difficulties and frustrations for forecasters{7]smallminuscule eyesxe2x80x94those less than 10xc2xa0nmi (19xc2xa0km 12xc2xa0mi) acrossxe2x80x94often trigger eyewall replacement cycles where a new eyewall begins to form outside the original eyewall this can take place anywhere from fifteen to hundreds of kilometers (ten to a few hundred miles) outside the inner eye the storm then develops two concentric eyewalls or an "eye within an eye" in most cases the outer eyewall begins to contract soon after its formation which chokes off the inner eye and leaves a much larger but more stable eye while the replacement cycle tends to weaken storms as it occurs the new eyewall can contract fairly quickly after the old eyewall dissipates allowing the storm to re-strengthen this may trigger another re-strengthen cycle of eyewall replacement{8]eyes can range in size from 370xc2xa0km (230xc2xa0mi) (typhoon carmen){9] to a mere 37xc2xa0km (23xc2xa0mi) (hurricane wilma) across{10] while it is uncommon for storms with large eyes to become very intense it does occur especially in annular hurricanes hurricane isabel was the eleventh most powerful north atlantic hurricane in recorded history and sustained a large 65xe2x80x9380xc2xa0km (40xe2x80x9350xc2xa0mi)-wide eye for a period of several days{11]formation and detection{edit]see also: tropical cyclogenesistropical cyclones form when the energy released by the condensation of moisture in rising air causes a positive feedback loop over warm ocean waterstypically eyes are easy to spot using weather radar this radar image of hurricane andrew clearly shows the eye over southern floridatropical cyclones typically form from large disorganized areas of disturbed weather in tropical regions as more thunderstorms form and gather the storm develops rainbands which start rotating around a common center as the storm gains strength a ring of stronger convection forms at a certain distance from the rotational center of the developing storm since stronger thunderstorms and heavier rain mark areas of stronger updrafts the barometric pressure at the surface begins to drop and air begins to build up in the upper levels of the cyclone{12] this results in the formation of an upper level anticyclone or an area of high atmospheric pressure above the central dense overcast consequently most of this built up air flows outward anticyclonically above the tropical cyclone outside the forming eye the anticyclone at the upper levels of the atmosphere enhances the flow towards the center of the cyclone pushing air towards the eyewall and causing a positive feedback loop{12]however a small portion of the built-up air instead of flowing outward flows inward towards the center of the storm this causes air pressure to build even further to the point where the weight of the air counteracts the strength of the updrafts in the center of the storm air begins to descend in the center of the storm creating a mostly rain-free areaxe2x80x94a newly formed eye{12]there are many aspects of this process which remain a mystery scientists do not know why a ring of convection forms around the center of circulation instead of on top of it or why the upper-level anticyclone only ejects a portion of the excess air above the storm many theories exist as to the exact process by which the eye forms: all that is known for sure is that the eye is necessary for tropical cyclones to achieve high wind speeds{12]the formation of an eye is almost always an indicator of increasing tropical cyclone organisation and strength because of this forecasters watch developing storms closely for signs of eye formationfor storms with a clear eye detection of the eye is as simple as looking at pictures from a weather satellite however for storms with a filled eye or an eye completely covered by the central dense overcast other detection methods must be used observations from ships and hurricane hunters can pinpoint an eye visually by looking for a drop in wind speed or lack of rainfall in the storm's center in the united states south korea and a few other countries a network of nexrad doppler weather radar stations can detect eyes near the coast weather satellites also carry equipment for measuring atmospheric water vapor and cloud temperatures which can be used to spot a forming eye in addition scientists have recently discovered that the amount of ozone in the eye is much higher than the amount in the eyewall due to air sinking from the ozone-rich stratosphere instruments sensitive to ozone perform measurements which are used to observe rising and sinking columns of air and provide indication of the formation of an eye even before satellite imagery can determine its formation{13]associated phenomena{edit]a satellite photo of typhoon amber of the 1997 pacific typhoon season exhibiting an outer and inner eyewall while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycleeyewall replacement cycles{edit]main article: eyewall replacement cycleeyewall replacement cycles also called concentric eyewall cycles naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones generally with winds greater than 185xc2xa0kmh (115xc2xa0mph) or major hurricanes (category 3 or higher on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale) when tropical cyclones reach this intensity and the eyewall contracts or is already sufficiently small (see above) some of the outer rainbands may strengthen and organize into a ring of thunderstormsxe2x80x94an outer eyewallxe2x80x94that slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and angular momentum since the strongest winds are located in a cyclone's eyewall the tropical cyclone usually weakens during this phase as the inner wall is "choked" by the outer wall eventually the outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely and the storm can re-intensify{8]the discovery of this process was partially responsible for the end of the us government's hurricane modification experiment project stormfury this project set out to seed clouds outside the eyewall causing a new eyewall to form and weakening the storm when it was discovered that this was a natural process due to hurricane dynamics the project was quickly abandoned{8]almost every intense hurricane undergoes at least one of these cycles during its existence hurricane allen in 1980 went through repeated eyewall replacement cycles fluctuating between categoryxc2xa05 and categoryxc2xa03 status on the saffir-simpson scale several times hurricane juliette was a rare documented case of triple eyewalls{14]moats{edit]a moat in a tropical cyclone is a clear ring outside the eyewall or between concentric eyewalls characterized by subsidencexe2x80x94slowly sinking airxe2x80x94and little or no precipitation the air flow in the moat is dominated by the cumulative effects of stretching and shearing the moat between eyewalls is an area in the storm where the rotational speed of the air changes greatly in proportion to the distance from the storm's center; these areas are also known as rapid filamentation zones such areas can potentially be found near any vortex of sufficient strength but are most pronounced in strong tropical cyclones{15]eyewall mesovortices{edit]eyewall mesovortices are small scale rotational features found in the eyewalls of intense tropical cyclones they are similar in principle to small "suction vortices" often observed in multiple-vortex tornadoes{16] in these vortices wind speeds may be greater than anywhere else in the eyewall{17] eyewall mesovortices are most common during periods of intensification in tropical cyclones{16]eyewall mesovortices often exhibit unusual behavior in tropical cyclones they usually rotate around the low pressure center but sometimes they remain stationary eyewall mesovortices have even been documented to cross the eye of a storm these phenomena have been documented observationally{18] experimentally{16] and theoretically{19]eyewall mesovortices are a significant factor in the formation of tornadoes after tropical cyclone landfall mesovortices can spawn rotation in individual thunderstorms (a mesocyclone) which leads to tornadic activity at landfall friction is generated between the circulation of the tropical cyclone and land this can allow the mesovortices to descend to the surface causing tornadoes{20]stadium effect{edit]view of typhoon maysak's eye from the international space station on marchxc2xa031 2015 displaying a pronounced stadium effectthe stadium effect is a phenomenon observed in strong tropical cyclones it is a fairly common event where the clouds of the eyewall curve outward from the surface with height this gives the eye an appearance resembling an open dome from the air akin to a sports stadium an eye is always larger at the top of the storm and smallest at the bottom of the storm because the rising air in the eyewall follows isolines of equal angular momentum which also slope outward with height{21]{22]{23] in tropical cyclones with very small eyes the sloping phenomenon is much more pronouncedeye-like features{edit]an eye-like structure is often found in intensifying tropical cyclones similar to the eye seen in hurricanes or typhoons it is a circular area at the circulation center of the storm in which convection is absent these eye-like features are most normally found in intensifying tropical storms and hurricanes of categoryxc2xa01 strength on the saffir-simpson scale for example an eye-like feature was found in hurricane beta when the storm had maximum wind speeds of only 80xc2xa0kmh (50xc2xa0mph) well below hurricane force{24] the features are typically not visible on visible wavelengths or infrared wavelengths from space although they are easily seen on microwave satellite imagery{25] their development at the middle levels of the atmosphere is similar to the formation of a complete eye but the features might be horizontally displaced due to vertical wind shear{26]{27]hazards{edit]play mediaan aircraft flying through a storm's eyewall and into the calm eyethough the eye is by far the calmest part of the storm with no wind at the center and typically clear skies over the ocean it is possibly the most hazardous area in the eyewall wind-driven waves all travel in the same direction in the center of the eye however the waves converge from all directions creating erratic crests that can build on each other to become rogue waves the maximum height of hurricane waves is unknown but measurements during hurricane ivan when it was a category 4 hurricane estimated that waves near the eyewall exceeded 40xc2xa0m (130xc2xa0ft) from peak to trough{28]a common mistake especially in areas where hurricanes are uncommon is for residents to exit their homes to inspect the damage while the calm eye passes over only to be caught off guard by the violent winds in the opposite eyewall{29]other cyclones{edit]the north american blizzard of 2006 an extratropical storm showed an eye-like structure at its peak intensity (here seen just to the east of the delmarva peninsula)main article: cyclonethough only tropical cyclones have structures officially termed "eyes" there are other weather systems that can exhibit eye-like features{1]{30]polar lows{edit]polar lows are mesoscale weather systems typically smaller than 1000xc2xa0km (600xc2xa0mi) across found near the poles like tropical cyclones they form over relatively warm water and can feature deep convection and winds of gale force or greater unlike storms of tropical nature however they thrive in much colder temperatures and at much higher latitudes they are also smaller and last for shorter durations with few lasting longer than a day or so despite these differences they can be very similar in structure to tropical cyclones featuring a clear eye surrounded by an eyewall and bands of rain and snow{31]extratropical cyclones{edit]extratropical cyclones are areas of low pressure which exist at the boundary of different air masses almost all storms found at mid-latitudes are extratropical in nature including classic north american nor'easters and european windstorms the most severe of these can have a clear "eye" at the site of lowest barometric pressure though it is usually surrounded by lower non-convective clouds and is found near the back end of the storm{32]subtropical cyclones{edit]subtropical cyclones are low-pressure systems with some extratropical characteristics and some tropical characteristics as such they may have an eye while not being truly tropical in nature subtropical cyclones can be very hazardous generating high winds and seas and often evolve into fully tropical cyclones for this reason the national hurricane center began including subtropical storms in its naming scheme in 2002{33]tornadoes{edit]tornadoes are destructive small-scale storms which produce the fastest winds on earth there are two main typesxe2x80x94single-vortex tornadoes which consist of a single spinning column of air and multiple-vortex tornadoes which consist of small "suction vortices" resembling mini-tornadoes themselves all rotating around a common center both of these types of tornadoes are theorized to have calm eyes these theories are supported by doppler velocity observations by weather radar and eyewitness accounts{34]{35]extraterrestrial vortices{edit]a hurricane-like storm on the south pole of saturn displaying an eyewall tens of kilometers highsee also: extraterrestrial vortexnasa reported in november 2006 that the cassini spacecraft observed a "hurricane-like" storm locked to the south pole of saturn with a clearly defined eyewall the observation was particularly notable as eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than earth (including a failure to observe an eyewall in the great red spot of jupiter by the galileo spacecraft){36] in 2007 very large vortices on both poles of venus were observed by the venus express mission of the european space agency to have a dipole eye structure{37]see also{edit]tropical
