has accumulated 23 eva hourson 8 july 1992 at 12:38 utc kaleri started his first career spacewalk during the spacewalk he and cosmonaut aleksandr viktorenko inspected some of mir's gyrodynes{7] the spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minuteson 2 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk the main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the mir station{8] the spacewalk was kaleri's second career spacewalkon 9 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk the spacewalk began at 13:50 utc and ended at 20:28 utc during the spacewalk the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide progress vehicles docking with mir they also repaired the transceiver system that the mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the world{8]on 12 may 2000 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut sergei zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of mir the two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to seal tiny cracks

2004 kaleri and nasa astronaut michael foale floated outside the iss from the pirs docking compartment airlock{10] the spacewalk began at 4:17 est and foale and kaleri were able to complete all but two of their planned tasks swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the station's hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in kaleri's spacesuit kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit's visor{11] the spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes the excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for kalerihonours and awards{edit]hero of the russian federation (11 august 1992)
