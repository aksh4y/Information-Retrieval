with significant populationscuba dominican republic haiti jamaica puerto ricolanguagestaxc3xadnoreligionindigenous and christianitythe taxc3xadno people were among the indigenous people of the caribbean at the time of european contact in the late 15th century they were the principal inhabitants of most of cuba trinidad jamaica hispaniola (haiti and the dominican republic) and puerto rico in the greater antilles the northern lesser antilles and the bahamas they were known as the lucayans they spoke the taxc3xadno language (an arawakan language)the ancestors of the taxc3xadno entered the caribbean from south america and their culture is closely linked to that of mesoamericans{1] at the time of contact the taxc3xadno were divided into three broad groups known as the western taxc3xadno (jamaica most of cuba and the bahamas) the classic taxc3xadno (hispaniola and puerto rico) and the eastern taxc3xadno (northern lesser antilles) taxc3xadno groups were in conflict with the caribs of the southern lesser antillesat the time of columbus' arrival in 1492 there were five taxc3xadno chiefdoms and territories on hispaniola each led by a principal cacique (chieftain) to whom tribute was paid ayiti ("land of high mountains") was the indigenous taxc3xadno name for the island of hispaniola which (on the western side) has retained its name as haxc3xafti in frenchcuba the largest island of the antilles was originally divided into 29 chiefdoms most of the native settlements later became the site of spanish colonial cities retaining the original taxc3xadno names including havana batabanxc3xb3 camagxc3xbcey baracoa and bayamo{2] the name cuba comes from the taxc3xadno language although the exact meaning of the name is unclear it can be translated as "where fertile land is abundant" (cubao) or a "great place" (coabana)puerto rico was also divided into chiefdoms as the hereditary head chief of taxc3xadno nation the cacique received significant tribute at the time of the spanish conquest the largest taxc3xadno population centers may have had more than 3000 people each{3]the taxc3xadno were historically enemies of the neighboring carib nations a different group which also had its origins in south america and lived mainly in the lesser antilles{4] the relationship between the rival groups has been the subject of many studies for much of the 15th century the taxc3xadno tribe was being driven to the northeast in the caribbean because of raids by the carib women were taken as captives resulting in many carib women speaking taxc3xadno{5]the spaniards who arrived in the bahamas cuba and hispaniola in 1492 and later in puerto rico did not bring women on their first expeditions since the arrival of the conquistadores taino women were stolen and some became commodities for spaniards to trade the rape of taxc3xadno women in hispaniola by the spanish was common resulting in mestizo children{6]{7]{8] scholars suggest there was also substantial mestizaje (racial and cultural mixing) in cuba and several indian pueblos survived into the 19th centurythe taxc3xadno became nearly extinct as a culture following settlement by spanish colonists primarily due to infectious diseases for which they had no immunity the first recorded smallpox outbreak in hispaniola was in either december 1518 or january 1519{9] this smallpox epidemic killed almost 90 of the native americans who had not already perished{10] warfare and harsh enslavement by the colonists also caused many deaths{11] by 1548 the taxc3xadno population had declined to fewer than 500 starting in about 1840 there have been attempts to create a quasi-indigenous taxc3xadno identity in rural areas of cuba the dominican republic and puerto rico this trend accelerated among the puerto rican community in the mainland united states in the 1960s{12] at the 2010 us census 1098 people in puerto rico identified themselves as "puerto rican indian" 1410 identified as "spanish american indian" and 9399 identified as "taxc3xadno" in total 35856 puerto ricans considered themselves native american{13]contents1 terminology2 origins3 culture4 food and agriculture5 spirituality6

taxc3xadno people or taxc3xadno culture has been classified by some authorities as belonging to the arawak as their language was considered to belong to the arawak language family the languages of which were present throughout the caribbean and much of central and south america the early ethnohistorian daniel garrison brinton called the taxc3xadno people the "island arawak"{14] nevertheless contemporary scholars have recognized that the taxc3xadno had developed a distinct language and culturetaxc3xadno and arawak appellations have been used with numerous and contradictory meanings by writers travelers historians linguists and anthropologists often they were used interchangeably; "taxc3xadno" has been applied to the greater antillean nation only or including the bahamian nations or adding the leeward islands nations or all those excluding the puerto rican and leeward nations similarly "island taxc3xadno" has been used to refer to those living in the windward islands only to the northern caribbean inhabitants only as well as to the population of the entire caribbeanmodern historians linguists and anthropologists now hold that the term taxc3xadno should refer to all the taxc3xadnoarawak nations except for the caribs who are not seen to belong to the same people linguists continue to debate whether the carib language is an arawakan dialect or creole language or perhaps an individual language with an arawakan pidgin used for communication purposesrouse classifies as taxc3xadno all inhabitants of the greater antilles (except the western tip of cuba) the bahamian archipelago and the northern lesser antilles he subdivides the taxc3xadno into three main groups: classic taxc3xadno mostly from haiti puerto rico and the dominican republic; western taxc3xadno or sub-taxc3xadno for population from jamaica cuba (except for the western tip) and the bahamian archipelago; and eastern taxc3xadno for those from the virgin islands to montserrat{15]origins{edit]two schools of thought have emerged regarding the origin of the indigenous people of the caribbeanone group contends that the ancestors of the taxc3xadno came from the center of the amazon basin and are related to the yanomama this is indicated by linguistic cultural and ceramic evidence they migrated to the orinoco valley on the north coast from there they reached the caribbean by way of what is now guyana and venezuela into trinidad proceeding along the lesser antilles to cuba and the bahamian archipelago evidence that supports this theory includes the tracing of the ancestral cultures of these people to the orinoco valley and their languages to the amazon basin{16]{17]{18]the alternate theory known as the circum-caribbean theory contends that the ancestors of the taxc3xadno diffused from the colombian andes julian h steward who originated this concept suggests a migration from the andes to the caribbean and a parallel migration into central america and into the guianas venezuela and the amazon basin of south america{16]taxc3xadno culture as documented is believed to have developed in the caribbean the taxc3xadno creation story says that they emerged from caves in a sacred mountain on present-day hispaniola{19] in puerto rico 21st century studies have shown a high proportion of people having amerindian mtdna of the two major haplotypes found one does not exist in the taxc3xadno ancestral group so other native american people are also part of this genetic ancestry{17]culture{edit]dujo a wooden chair crafted by taxc3xadnostaxc3xadno society was divided into two classes: naborias (commoners) and nitaxc3xadnos (nobles) these were governed by male chiefs known as caciques who were advised by priestshealers known as bohiques caciques enjoyed the privilege of wearing golden pendants called guanxc3xadn living in square bohxc3xados instead of the round ones of ordinary villagers and sitting on wooden stools to be above the guests they received{20] bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with gods they were consulted and granted the taxc3xadno permission to engage in important tasksthe taxc3xadno had a matrilineal system of kinship descent and inheritance when a male heir was not present the inheritance or succession would go to the oldest male child of the deceased's sister the taxc3xadno had avunculocal post-marital residence meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle he was more important in the lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies some taxc3xadno practiced polygamy men and sometimes women might have two or three spouses a few caciques had as many as 30 wivesthe taxc3xadno women were highly skilled in agriculture the people depended on it but the men also fished and hunted they made fishing nets and ropes from cotton and palm their dugout canoes (kanoa) were made in various sizes which could hold from 2 to 150 people an average-sized canoe would hold about 15xe2x80x9320 people they used bows and arrows for hunting and developed the use of poisons on their arrowheadsa frequently worn hair style for women featured bangs in front and longer hair in back they sometimes wore gold jewelry paint andor shells taxc3xadno men and unmarried women were usually naked although women wore a small cotton apron called a nagua after marriage{21] the taxc3xadno lived in settlements called yucayeques which varied in size depending on the location those in puerto rico and hispaniola were the largest and those in the bahamas were the smallest in the center of a typical village was a central plaza used for various social activities such as games festivals religious rituals and public ceremonies these plazas had many shapes including oval rectangular and narrow and elongated ceremonies where the deeds of the ancestors were celebrated called areitos were performed here{22]often the general population lived in large circular buildings (bohios) constructed with wooden poles woven straw and palm leaves these houses built surrounding the central plaza could hold 10-15 families each the cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (caney) of similar construction with wooden porches taxc3xadno home furnishings included cotton hammocks (hamaca) sleeping and sitting mats made of palms wooden chairs (dujo or duho) with woven seats platforms and cradles for childrencaguana ceremonial ball court (batey) outlined with stonesthe taxc3xadno played a ceremonial ball game called batey opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team and used a solid rubber ball normally the teams were composed of men but occasionally women played the game as well{23] the classic taxc3xadno played in the village's center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called batey games on the batey are believed to have been used for conflict resolution between communities the most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms' boundaries{24] often chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game{23]taxc3xadno spoke an arawakan language and used an early form of writing proto-writing in the form of petroglyph{25] some of the words used by them such as barbacoa ("barbecue") hamaca ("hammock") kanoa ("canoe") tabaco ("tobacco") yuca batata ("sweet potato") and juracxc3xa1n ("hurricane") have been incorporated into spanish and englishfor warfare the men made wooden war clubs which they called a macana it was about one inch thick and was similar to the coco macaquefood and agriculture{edit]cassava (yuca) roots the taxc3xadnos' main croptaxc3xadno staples included vegetables fruit meat and fish there were no large animals native to the caribbean but they captured and ate small animals such as hutias and other mammals earthworms lizards turtles and birds manatees were speared and fish were caught in nets speared trapped in weirs or caught with hook and line wild parrots were decoyed with domesticated birds and iguanas were taken from trees and other vegetation the taxc3xadno stored live animals until they were ready to be consumed: fish and turtles were stored in weirs and hutias and dogs were stored in corrals{26]due to this lack of large game the taxc3xadno people became very skilled fishermen one technique was to hook a remora also known as a suckerfish to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle once this happened men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch another method used by the taxc3xadnos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers upon eating the bait the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in this poison did not affect the edibility of the fish taxc3xadno youth mostly young boys also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves{27]taxc3xadno groups in the more developed islands such as puerto rico hispaniola and jamaica relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs) fields for important root crops such as the staple yuca were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil called conucos this improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique typically conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows{28] the primary root crop was yucacassava a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root it was planted using a coa a kind of hoe made completely from wood women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop{28]contrary to mainland practices corn was not ground into flour and baked into bread but was cooked and eaten off the cob corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava bread in the high humidity of the caribbean corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha{29] the taxc3xadno grew squash beans peppers peanuts and pineapples tobacco calabashes (west indian pumpkins) and cotton were grown around the houses other fruits and vegetables such as palm nuts guavas and zamia roots were collected from the wild{28]spirituality{edit]taxc3xadno zemxc3xad sculpture from walters art museumtaxc3xadno spirituality centered on the worship of zemxc3xads a zemxc3xad is a spirit or ancestor (the word "god" is a misnomer but will be used henceforth for better understanding) the major taxc3xadno gods are yxc3xbacahu and atabey yxc3xbacahu{30] which means spirit of cassava was the god of cassavaxc2xa0xe2x80x93 the taxc3xadnos' main cropxc2xa0xe2x80x93 and the sea atabey{31] mother of yxc3xbacahu was the goddess of the moon fresh waters and fertilitythe minor taxc3xadno gods related to the growing of cassava the process of life creation and death baibrama was a minor god worshiped for his assistance in growing cassava and curing people from its poisonous juice boinayel and his twin brother mxc3xa1rohu were the gods of rain and fair weather respectively{32] guabancex was the non-nurturing aspect of the goddess atabey who had control over natural disasters juracxc3xa1n is often identified as the god of storms but the word simply means hurricane in the taxc3xadno language guabancex had two assistants: guataubxc3xa1 a messenger who created hurricane winds and coatrisquie who created floodwaters{33]maquetaurie guayaba or maketaori guayaba was the god of coaybay or coabey the land of the dead opiyelguabirxc3xa1n' a dog-shaped god watched over the dead deminxc3xa1n caracaracol a male cultural hero from which the taxc3xadno believed themselves to be descended was worshipped as a zemxc3xad{32] macocael was a cultural hero worshipped as a god who had failed to guard the mountain from which human beings arose he was punished by being turned into stone or a bird a frog or a reptile depending on interpretation of the mythzemxc3xad a physical object housing a god spirit or ancestorlombards museumzemxc3xad was also the name the people gave to their physical representations of the gods whether objects or drawings they were made in many forms and materials and have been found in a variety of settings the majority of zemxc3xads were crafted from wood but stone bone shell pottery and cotton were also used{34] zemxc3xad petroglyphs were carved on rocks in streams ball courts and on stalagmites in caves cemxc3xad pictographs were found on secular objects such as pottery and on tattoos yucahxc3xba the god of cassava was represented with a three-pointed zemxc3xad which could be found in conucos to increase the yield of cassava wood and stone zemxc3xads have been found in caves in hispaniola and jamaica{35] cemxc3xads are sometimes represented by toads turtles fishes snakes and various abstract and human-like facescohoba spoon 1200-1500 brooklyn museumrock petroglyph overlaid with chalk in the caguana indigenous ceremonial center in utuado puerto ricosome zemxc3xads are accompanied by a small table or tray which is believed to be a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba prepared from the beans of a species of piptadenia tree these trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes before certain ceremonies taxc3xadnos would purify themselves either by inducing vomiting with a swallowing stick or by fasting{36] after communal bread was served first to the zemxc3xad then to the cacique and then to the common people the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of maraca and other instrumentsone taxc3xadno oral tradition explains that the sun and moon come out of caves another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night because it was believed that the sun would transform them the taxc3xadno believed they were descended from the union of deminxc3xa1n caracaracol and a female turtle the origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood which occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father) the father put the son's bones into a gourd or calabash when the bones turned into fish the gourd broke and all the water of the world came pouring outtaxc3xadnos believed that jupias the souls of the dead would go to coaybay the underworld and there they rest by day at night they would assume the form of bats and eat the guava fruitspaniards and taxc3xadno{edit]columbus and his crew landing on an island in the bahamas on october 12 1492 were the first europeans to encounter the taxc3xadno people columbus described the taxc3xadnos as a physically tall well-proportioned people with a noble and kind personalitycolumbus wrote:they traded with us and gave us everything they had with good willxc2xa0 they took great delight in pleasing usxc2xa0 they are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil; nor do they murder or stealyour highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better peoplexc2xa0 they love their neighbours as themselves and they have the sweetest talk in the world and are gentle and always laughingxe2x80x94xe2x80x89{37]at this time the neighbors of the taxc3xadno were the guanahatabeys in the western tip of cuba the island-caribs in the lesser antilles from guadeloupe to grenada and the calusa and ais nations of florida the taxc3xadno called the island guanahanxc3xad which columbus renamed as san salvador (spanish for "holy savior") columbus called the taxc3xadno "indians" a reference that has grown to encompass all the indigenous peoples of the western hemisphere a group of taxc3xadno people accompanied columbus on his return voyage back to spain{38]on columbus' second voyage he began to require tribute from the taxc3xadno in hispaniola according to kirkpatrick sale each adult over 14 years of age was expected to deliver a hawks bell full of gold every three months or when this was lacking twenty-five pounds of spun cotton if this tribute was not brought the spanish cut off the hands of the taxc3xadno and left them to bleed to death{39] these cruel practices inspired many revolts by the taxc3xadno and campaigns against the spanish xe2x80x94some being successful some notin 1511 several caciques in puerto rico such as agxc3xbceybanxc3xa1 ii arasibo hayuya jumacao urayoxc3xa1n guarionex and orocobix allied with the carib and tried to oust the spaniards the revolt was suppressed by the indio-spanish forces of governor juan ponce de lexc3xb3n{40] hatuey a taxc3xadno chieftain who had fled from hispaniola to cuba with 400 natives to unite the cuban natives was burned at the stake on february 2 1512in hispaniola a taxc3xadno chieftain named enriquillo mobilized over 3000 taxc3xadno in a successful rebellion in the 1520s these taxc3xadno were accorded land and a charter from the royal administration despite the small spanish military presence in the region they often used diplomatic divisions and with help from powerful native allies controlled most of the region{41]{42] in exchange for a seasonal salary religious and language education the taxc3xadno were required to work for spanish and indian land owners this system of labor was part of the encomiendawomen{edit]taxc3xadno society was based on a matrilineal system meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived together with other women and their children apart from the men because of this taxc3xadno women seem to have had a lot of control over their lives their co-villagers and their bodies{43] since they lived separately from men they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact this is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with taxc3xadno culture they reportedly perceived women as xe2x80x9cmacho womenxe2x80x9d who had strong control over the menmost historical evidence suggests that although unclear it seems that taxc3xadno gender roles were non exclusive to most of the activities done in their communitytaxc3xadno women played an important role in intercultural interaction between spaniards and the taino people when taxc3xadno men were fighting intervention from other groups women were left back home turning into the primary food producers or ritual specialists{44] women seem to have participated in all levels of the taxc3xadno political hierarchy they went up to occupy roles as high up as being caciques{45] this meant that taxc3xadno women could potentially give permission to other taxc3xadno men and women to take on important tasks and that they could too make important choices for the village{46] there is evidence that suggests that the women who were wealthier among the tribe collected crafted goods that they would then use for trade or as giftsdespite women being seemingly independent in taxc3xadno society coming into the era of contact spaniards took taxc3xadno women as an exchange item putting them in a non-autonomous position dr chanca a physician who traveled with christopher columbus reported in a letter that spaniards took as many women as they possibly could and kept them as concubines{47] some sources report that despite women being free and powerful before the contact era they became the first commodities up for spaniards to trade or often steal this marked the beginning of a lifetime of theft and abuse of taxc3xadno women{48]depopulation{edit]early population estimates of hispaniola probably the most populous island inhabited by taxc3xadnos range from 100000 to 1000000 people the maximum estimates for jamaica and puerto rico are 600000 people{49] the spanish priest bartolomxc3xa9 de las casas (who had lived in santo domingo) wrote in his 1561 multi-volume history of the indies:{50]there were 60000 people living on this island {when i arrived in 1508] including the indians; so that from 1494 to 1508 over three million people had perished from war slavery and the mines who in future generations will believe this?researchers today doubt las casas' figures for the pre-contact levels of the taxc3xadno population considering them an exaggeration for example anderson cxc3xb3rdova estimates a maximum of 500000 people inhabiting the island{51] the taxc3xadno population estimates vary a great deal from a few hundred thousand up to 8000000{52] they had no resistance to old world diseases notably smallpox{53] the encomienda system brought many taxc3xadno to work in the fields and mines in exchange for spanish protection{54] education and a seasonal salary{55] under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials{56] many spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the anaborios and spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their land and wealth it would take some time before the taxc3xadno revolted against their oppressors xe2x80x94 both indian and spanish alike xe2x80x94 and many military campaigns before emperor charles v eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery{57]{58]in thirty years between 80 and 90 of the taxc3xadno population died{59] because of the increased number of people (spanish) on the island there was a higher demand for food taxc3xadno cultivation was converted to spanish methods in hopes of frustrating the spanish some taxc3xadnos refused to plant or harvest their crops the supply of food became so low in 1495 and 1496 that some 50000 died from the severity of the famine{60] historians have determined that the massive decline was due more to infectious disease outbreaks than any warfare or direct attacks{61]{62] by 1507 their numbers had shrunk to 60000 scholars believe that epidemic disease (smallpox influenza measles and typhus) was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the indigenous people{63]{64]{65]taxc3xadno heritage in modern times{edit]groups of people currently identify as taxc3xadno most notably among the puerto ricans and dominicans both on the islands and on united states mainlandsome scholars such as jalil sued badillo an ethnohistorian at the university of puerto rico assert that although the official spanish histories speak of the disappearance of the taxc3xadnos many survivors left descendants usually by intermarrying with other ethnic groups recent research revealed a high percentage of mixed or tri-racial ancestry in puerto rico and the dominican republic those claiming taxc3xadno ancestry also have spanish ancestry or african ancestry and often bothfrank moya pons a dominican historian documented that spanish colonists intermarried with taxc3xadno women over time some of their mixed descendants intermarried with africans creating a tri-racial creole culture 1514 census records reveal that 40 of spanish men on the island of hispaniola had taxc3xadno wives ethnohistorian lynne guitar writes that the taxc3xadno were declared extinct in spanish documents as early as the 16th century; however individual taxc3xadnos continued to appear in wills and legal records for several decades after the arrival of the spaniards{66]evidence suggests that some taxc3xadno men and african women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated maroon communities in the interior of the islands where they evolved into a hybrid rural or campesino population with little or no interference from the spanish authorities scholars also note that contemporary rural dominicans retain taxc3xadno linguistic features agricultural practices food ways medicine fishing practices technology architecture oral history and religious views however these cultural traits are often looked down upon by urbanites as backwards{66]sixteen xe2x80x9cautosomalxe2x80x9d studies of peoples in the spanish-speaking caribbean and its diaspora (mostly puerto ricans) have shown that between 10-20 of their dna is indigenous with some individuals having slightly higher scores and others having lower scores or no indigenous dna at all{67] a recent study of a population in eastern puerto rico where the majority of persons tested claimed taxc3xadno ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61 mtdna (distant maternal ancestry) and 0 y-chromosome dna (distant paternal ancestry) demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population{68]groups such as the jatibonicu taino tribal nation of boriken puerto rico (1970) the taxc3xadno nation of the antilles nyc (1993) united confederation of taxc3xadno people nyc (1998) and el pueblo guatu ma-cu a borikxc3xa9n puerto rico (2000) have been established to foster taxc3xadno culture{citation needed] taxc3xadno activists have created two unique writing scripts the scripts are used to write spanish not a retained language from pre-columbian ancestors{69] the organization guaka-kxc3xba teaches and uses their script among their own members the lgtk (liga guakxc3xada taxc3xadna-kxc3xa9) has promoted teaching their script among elementary and middle school students to strengthen their
