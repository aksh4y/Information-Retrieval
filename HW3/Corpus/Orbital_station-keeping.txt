b'orbital station-keeping - wikipedia orbital station-keepingfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchin astrodynamics the orbital maneuvers made by thruster burns that are needed to keep a spacecraft in a particular assigned orbit are called orbital station-keepingfor many earth satellites the effects of the non-keplerian forces ie the deviations of the gravitational force of the earth from that of a homogeneous sphere gravitational forces from sunmoon solar radiation pressure and air-drag must be counteractedthe deviation of earth's gravity field from that of a homogeneous sphere and gravitational forces from sunmoon will in general perturb the orbital plane for a sun-synchronous orbit the precession of the orbital plane caused by the oblateness of the earth is a desirable feature that is part of the mission design but the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of sunmoon is undesirable for geostationary spacecraft the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of sunmoon must be counteracted by a rather large expense of fuel as the inclination should be kept sufficiently small for the spacecraft to be tracked by a non-steerable antennafor spacecraft in low orbits the effects of atmospheric drag must often be compensated for for some missions this is needed simply to avoid re-entry; for other missions typically missions for which the orbit should be accurately synchronized with earth rotation this is necessary to avoid the orbital period shorteningsolar radiation pressure will in general perturb the eccentricity (ie the eccentricity vector) see orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) for some missions this must be actively counter-acted with manoeuvres for geostationary spacecraft the eccentricity must be kept sufficiently small for a spacecraft to be tracked with a non-steerable antenna also for earth observation spacecraft for which a very repetitive orbit with a fixed ground track is desirable the eccentricity vector should be kept as fixed as possible a large part of this compensation can be done by using a frozen orbit design but for the fine control manoeuvres with thrusters are neededfor spacecraft in a halo orbit around a lagrangian point stationkeeping is even more fundamental as such an orbit is unstable; without an active control with thruster burns the smallest deviation in positionvelocity would result in the spacecraft leaving the orbit completely{1]contents1 station-keeping in low earth orbit2 station-keeping for earth observation spacecraft3 station-keeping in geostationary orbit4 station-keeping at libration points5 see also6 references7 external linksstation-keeping in low earth orbit{edit]for a spacecraft in a very low orbit the atmospheric drag is sufficiently strong to cause a re-entry before the intended end of mission if orbit raising manoeuvres are not executed from time to timean example of this is the international space station (iss) which has an operational altitude above earth's surface of between 330 and 410xc2xa0km due to atmospheric drag the space station is constantly losing orbital energy in order to compensate for this loss which would eventually lead to a re-entry of the station it has from time to time been re-boosted to a higher orbit the chosen orbital altitude is a trade-off between the average thrust needed to counter-act the air drag and the delta-v needed to send payloads and people to the station the upper limitation of orbit altitude is due to the constraints imposed by the soyuz spacecraft on 25 april 2008 the automated transfer vehicle "jules verne" raised the orbit of the iss for the first time thereby proving its ability to replace (and outperform) the soyuz at this task{citation needed]goce which orbited at 255xc2xa0km (later reduced to 235xc2xa0km) used ion thrusters to provide up to 20xc2xa0mn of thrust to compensate for the drag on its frontal area of about 1 m2{2]station-keeping for earth observation spacecraft{edit]for earth observation spacecraft typically operated in an altitude above the earth surface of about 700 xe2x80x93 800xc2xa0km the air-drag is very faint and a re-entry due to air-drag is not a concern but if the orbital period should be synchronous with the earth's rotation to maintain a fixed ground track the faint air-drag at this high altitude must also be counter-acted by orbit raising manoeuvres in the form of thruster burns tangential to the orbit these manoeuvres will be very small typically in the order of a few mms of delta-v if a frozen orbit design is used these very small orbit raising manoeuvres are sufficient to also control the eccentricity vectorto maintain a fixed ground track it is also necessary to make out-of-plane manoeuvres to compensate for the inclination change caused by sunmoon gravitation these are executed as thruster burns orthogonal to the orbital plane for sun-synchronous spacecraft having a constant geometry relative to the sun the inclination change due to the solar gravitation is particularly large; a delta-v in the order of 1xe2x80x932xc2xa0ms per year can be needed to keep the inclination constantstation-keeping in geostationary orbit{edit]inclined orbital planesfor more details on this topic see geostationary_orbit xc2xa7xc2xa0orbital_stabilityfor geostationary spacecraft thruster burns orthogonal to the orbital plane must be executed to compensate for the effect of the lunarsolar gravitation that perturbs the orbit pole with typically 085 degrees per year{3] the delta-v needed to compensate for this perturbation keeping the inclination to the equatorial plane amounts to in the order 45xc2xa0ms per year this part of the geo station-keeping is called north-south control{4]the east-west control is the control of the orbital period and the eccentricity vector performed by making thruster burns tangential to the orbit these burns are then designed to keep the orbital period perfectly synchronous with the earth rotation and to keep the eccentricity sufficiently small perturbation of the orbital period results from the imperfect rotational symmetry of the earth relative the northsouth axis sometimes called the ellipticity of the earth equator the eccentricity (ie the eccentricity vector) is perturbed by the solar radiation pressure the fuel needed for this east-west control is much less than what is needed for the north-south control (about 2xc2xa0ms per year depending on the desired longitude) (see geostationary orbitorbital stability)to extend the life-time of ageing geostationary spacecraft with little fuel left one sometimes discontinues the north-south control only continuing with the east-west control as seen from an observer on the rotating earth the spacecraft will then move north-south with a period of 24 hours when this north-south movement gets too large a steerable antenna is needed to track the spacecraft an example of this{when?] is artemis{citation needed]to save weight it is crucial for geo satellites to have the most fuel-efficient propulsion system some modern satellites are therefore employing a high specific impulse system like plasma or ion thrustersstation-keeping at libration points{edit]orbits of spacecraft are also possible around lagrangian pointsxe2x80x94also referred to as libration pointsxe2x80x94gravity wells that exist at five points in relation to two larger solar system bodies for example there are five of these points in the sun-earth system five in the earth-moon system and so on small spacecraft may orbit around these gravity wells with a minimum of propellant required for station-keeping purposes two orbits that have been used for such purposes include halo and lissajous orbits{5]orbits around libration points are dynamically unstable meaning small departures from equilibrium grow exponentially over time{1] as a result spacecraft in libration point orbits must use propulsion systems to perform orbital station-keepingone important libration point is earth-sun l1 and three heliophysics missions have been orbiting l1 since approximately 2000 station-keeping propellant use can be quite low facilitating missions that can potentially last decades should other spacecraft systems remain operational the three spacecraftxe2x80x94advanced composition explorer (ace) solar heliospheric observatory (soho) and the global geoscience wind satellitexe2x80x94each have annual station-keeping propellant requirements of approximately 1xc2xa0ms or less{5] earth-sun l2xe2x80x94approximately 15 million kilometers from earth in the anti-sun directionxe2x80x94is another important lagrangian point and the esa herschel space observatory operated there in a lissajous orbit during 2009xe2x80x932013 at which time it ran out of coolant for the space telescope small station-keeping orbital maneuvers were executed approximately monthly to maintain the spacecraft in the station-keeping orbit{1]the james webb space telescope needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around the earth-sun l2 which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime: it is being designed to carry enough for ten years{6]see also{edit]orbital maneuverdelta-v budgetorbital perturbation analysisteleoperator retrieval system
