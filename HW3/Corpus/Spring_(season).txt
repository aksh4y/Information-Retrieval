preceding summer there are various technical definitions of spring but local usage of the term varies according to local climate cultures and customs when it is spring in the northern hemisphere it will be autumn in the southern hemisphere and vice versa at the spring equinox days are approximately 12 hours long with day length increasing as the season progressesspring and "springtime" refer to the season and also to ideas of rebirth rejuvenation renewal resurrection and regrowth subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons eg dry or wet monsoonal or cyclonic often cultures have locally defined names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in europe spring is the time when many plants begin to grow and flowercontents1

values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis with each season lasting three months the three warmest months are by definition summer the three coldest months are winter and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn spring when defined in this manner can start on different dates in different regionsin most northern hemisphere temperate locations spring months are march april and may although differences exist from country to country{1] (summer is june july august; autumn is september october november; winter is december january february) most southern hemisphere temperate locations have opposing seasons with spring in september october and novemberswedish meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees celsius for seven consecutive days thus the date varies with latitude and elevation{2] in australia and new zealand spring conventionally begins on 1 september and ends 30 november{3]astronomical and solar reckoning{edit]in some cultures in the northern hemisphere (eg germany) the astronomical vernal equinox (varying between 19 and 21 march) is taken to mark the first day of spring and the summer solstice (around 21 june) is taken as the first day of summer in persian culture the first day of spring is the first day of the first month (called farvardin) which begins on 20 or 21 march in other traditions the equinox is taken as mid-springin the traditional chinese calendar the "spring" season (xe6x98xa5) consists of the end of winter (from 4 february) and beginning of spring (to 5 may) roughly taking the equinox as its midpoint similarly according to the celtic tradition which is based solely on daylight and the strength of the noon sun spring begins in early february (near imbolc or candlemas) and continues until early may (beltane)other calendar-based reckoning{edit]in ireland spring traditionally starts on february 1 st brigid's day{4] although irish meteorologists consider the whole of february to be part of winter{5]{6]ecological reckoning{edit]the beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates the phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological indicators such as the blossoming of a range of plant species the activities of animals and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro flora to flourish these indicators along with the beginning of spring vary according to the local climate and according to the specific weather of a particular year most ecologists divide the year into six seasons that have no fixed dates in addition to spring ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate prevernal (early or pre-spring) season between the hibernal (winter) and vernal (spring) seasons this is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground{7]natural events{edit]hundreds of sour cherry blooming in extremadura spain during springa blooming field of garland chrysanthemum a typical spring flower in israela willow in stockholm in april 2016during early spring the axis of the earth is increasing its tilt relative to the sun and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere the hemisphere begins to warm significantly causing new plant growth to "spring forth" giving the season its name{citation needed]any snow begins to melt swelling streams with runoff and any frosts become less severe in climates that have no snow and rare frosts air and ground temperatures increase more rapidlymany flowering plants bloom at this time of year in a long succession sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground and continuing into early summer{citation needed] in normally snowless areas "spring" may begin as early as february (northern hemisphere) heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias cherries and quince or august (southern hemisphere) in the same way{citation needed] many temperate areas have a dry spring and wet autumn (fall) which brings about flowering in this season more consistent with the need for water as well as warmth subarctic areas may not experience "spring" at all until maywhile spring is a result of the warmth caused by the changing orientation of the earth's axis relative to the sun the weather in many parts of the world is affected by other less predictable events the rainfall in spring (or any season) follows trends more related to longer cyclesxe2x80x94such as the solar cyclexe2x80x94or events created by ocean currents and ocean temperaturesxe2x80x94for example the el nixc3xb1o effect and the southern oscillation indexunstable spring weather may occur more often when warm air begins to invade from lower latitudes while cold air is still pushing from the polar regions flooding is also most common in and near mountainous areas during this time of year because of snow-melt which is accelerated by warm rains in north america tornado alley is most active at this time of year especially since the rocky mountains prevent the surging hot and cold air masses from spreading eastward and instead force them into direct conflict besides tornadoes supercell thunderstorms can also produce dangerously large hail and very high winds for which a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning is usually issued even more so than in winter the jet streams play an important role in unstable and severe northern hemisphere weather in springtime{citation needed]in recent decades season creep has been observed which means that many phenological signs of spring are occurring earlier in many regions by around two days per decadespring in the southern hemisphere is different in several significant ways to that of the northern hemisphere for several reasons including:there is no land bridge between southern hemisphere countries and the antarctic zone capable of bringing in cold air without the temperature-mitigating effects of extensive tracts of water;the vastly greater amount of ocean in the southern hemisphere at all latitudes;at this time in earth's geologic history the earth has an orbit which brings it in closer to the southern hemisphere for its warmer seasons;there is a circumpolar flow of air (the roaring 40s and 50s) uninterrupted by large land masses;no equivalent jet streams; andthe peculiarities of the reversing ocean currents in the pacific{citation needed]cultural events{edit]albania{edit]main article: spring dayalbania celebrates the lunar spring day (albanian: dita e verxc3xabs or dita e luleve) on 14 march and from 2004 it has been a national holiday it is an old pagan practice particularly popular in the city of elbasan central albaniaaccording to some sources dita e verxc3xabs derives from the arbxc3xabreshxc3xab an albanian community that has lived in italy since the 15th century on 14 march the arbxc3xabreshxc3xab of the italian coast collect a tuft of grass roots and soil bringing it home to commemorate the anniversary of their emigration from albania in fact some sources date back this

the 24th of may has remained a public holiday in the british overseas territory the name and dedication of the holiday changed over the 20th century however becoming empire day then commonwealth day and now bermuda day in its current incarnation the day has been used since the 1970s to celebrate bermuda's diversity and unity with a large parade in the city of hamilton that replaced the earlier easter parade that many black bermudians had felt was irredeemably marred by racism the 24th of may is also traditionally the first day of the year when bermudians will swim despite local waters being warmed by the gulf stream the humidity of bermuda's oceanic climate ensures its winters and summers are mild (respectively neither as cold nor as warm as experienced in continental areas such as new york) but also means that temperatures are slow to change other than through the blasts of arctic air behind the cold fronts that sweep across from north america most forcefully during the winter at intervals of several days) this means that cool wet and blustery weather is typical in bermuda late in spring when temperatures in the north-east of the united states have already begun spiking to levels bermuda will not see until mid-summer (this is not always apparent from comparing average high temperatures as bermuda's humid climate also moderates temperature change during the course of a day with only a 10 degree fahrenheit difference between daily high and low temperatures by comparison the average high and low temperatures for the 1st of may in new york city are 67xc2xb0 and 50xc2xb0 and on the 31st of may are 75xc2xb0 and 59xc2xb0 in bermuda the historical averages for those dates are 74xc2xb0 and 62xc2xb0 on the 1st and 79xc2xb0 and 67xc2xb0 on the 31st the record high for may in new york however was 97xc2xb0 on the 20th of may 1996 the highest temperature ever recorded in bermuda at any time of year was 94xc2xb0 although the temperature has climbed above 86xc2xb0 in only a handful of years since records began){9] bermudians consequently joke that they do not swim again following the traditional dip on the 24th of may 'til the weather has warmed
