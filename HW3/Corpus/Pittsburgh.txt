empire 1681xe2x80x931781united states 1776xe2x80x93presentpittsburgh was named in 1758 by general john forbes in honor of british statesman william pitt 1st earl of chatham the original pronunciation would have been xcbx88pxc9xaatsbrxc9x99 -bxc9x99rxc9x99 pits-brxc9x99 or pits-bxc9x99-rxc9x99 matching similarly named places in great britain such as edinburgh in scotland and aldeburgh in suffolk{19] pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771 and as a borough on april 22 1794 with the following act:{20] "be it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvaniaby the authority of the same that the said town of pittsburgh shall beerected into a borough which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever"{21]the current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18 1816 (though not on the original document) the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the "h" was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 1911{21]the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans{22] the first known european to enter the region was the french explorertrader robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio river{23] european pioneers primarily dutch followed in the early 18th century michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a 1717 manuscript and later that year european fur traders established area posts and settlements{24]in 1749 french soldiers from quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite canada with french louisiana via the rivers{24] during 1753xe2x80x9354 the british hastily built fort prince george before a larger french force drove them off the french built fort duquesne based on lasalle's 1669 claims the french and indian war the north american front of the seven years' war began with the future pittsburgh as its center british general edward braddock was dispatched with major george washington as his aide to take fort duquesne{25] the british and colonial force were defeated at braddock's field general john forbes finally took the forks in 1758 forbes began construction on fort pitt named after william pitt the elder while the settlement was named "pittsborough"{26]during pontiac's rebellion native tribes conducted a siege of fort pitt for two months until colonel henry bouquet relieved it after the battle of bushy run fort pitt is notable as the site of an early use of smallpox for biological warfare lord jeffrey amherst ordered blankets contaminated from smallpox victims to be distributed in 1763 to the tribes surrounding the fort the disease spread into other areas infected other tribes and killed hundreds of thousands{27]{28]{not in citation given]during this period the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy based in new york had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix the penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the iroquois a 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "manor of pittsburgh"{29] both the colony of virginia and the province of pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780 when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the masonxe2x80x93dixon line westward placing pittsburgh in pennsylvania on march 8 1771 bedford county pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier on april 16 1771 the city's first civilian local government was created as pitt township{30]{31] william teagarden was the first constable and william troop was the first clerk{32]following the american revolution the village of pittsburgh continued to grow one of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the ohio country in 1784 thomas viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the penn family attorney pittsburgh became a possession of pennsylvania in 1785 the following year the pittsburgh post-gazette was started and in 1787 the pittsburgh academy was chartered unrest during the whiskey rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area by 1797 glass manufacture began while the population grew to around 1400 settlers came via routes over the appalachian mountains or through the great lakes fort pitt (now pittsburgh) at the source of the

1816 the 46-year-old local government became a city in the 1830s many welsh people from the merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the merthyr rising by the 1840s pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the allegheny mountains the great fire of pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845 the city rebuilt with the aid of irish immigrants and by 1857 pittsburgh's 1000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of european immigrants to the areathe american civil war boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand andrew carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the edgar thomson steel works in north braddock pennsylvania which evolved into the carnegie steel company he adopted the bessemer process to increase productionin 1901 carnegie merged several companies into us steel by 1910 pittsburgh was the nation's 8th-largest city accounting for between a third and a half of national steel output the city's population swelled to over a half million with european immigration via ellis island in new york harbor by 1940 non-hispanic whites were 906 of the city's population{33] pittsburgh also became a main destination of the african-american great migration from the rural south during the first half of the 20th century{34] limited initially by discrimination some 95 percent of the men became unskilled steel workers{35] during world war ii demand increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort{26] this resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry the city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"{36]{37] was being overshadowed by james parton's 1868 observation of pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off"{38]following the war the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "renaissance" cleaning up the air and the rivers the "renaissance ii" project followed in 1977 focused on cultural and neighborhood development the industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring there were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures{10]president barack obama visiting carnegie mellon university's national robotics engineering center in 2011in the later 20th century the area shifted its economic base to education tourism and services largely based on healthcaremedicine finance and high technology such as robotics although pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs while 680000 people lived in the city proper in 1950 a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population even as the metropolitan area population increased againduring the late 2000s recession pittsburgh was economically strong adding jobs when most cities were losing them it was one of the few cities in the united states to see housing property values rise between 2006 and 2011 the pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (msa) experienced over 10 appreciation in housing pricesxe2x80x94the highest appreciation of the largest 25 msas in the united
