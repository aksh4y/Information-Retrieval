it is located right above the planetary boundary layer and is the layer in which most weather phenomena take place the troposphere extends upwards from right above the boundary layer and ranges in height from an average of 9xc2xa0km (56xc2xa0mi; 30000xc2xa0ft) at the poles to 17xc2xa0km (11xc2xa0mi; 56000xc2xa0ft) at the equator{3]{4] in the absence of inversions and not considering moisture the temperature lapse rate for this layer is 65xc2xa0xc2xb0c per kilometer on average according to the us standard atmosphere{5] a measurement of both the tropospheric and the stratospheric lapse rates helps identifying the location of the tropopause since temperature increases with height in the stratosphere and hence the lapse rate becomes negative the tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate falls below a prescribed thresholdsince the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it it is at its peak levels over the equator and reaches minimum heights over the poles on account of this the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17xc2xa0km over the equator due to the variation in starting height the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopausegiven that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies there exists an alternative definition named dynamic tropopause{6] it is formed with the aid of potential vorticity which is defined as the product of the isentropic density ie the density that arises from using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate and the absolute vorticity given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere{7] instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in potential vorticity units (pvu){nb 1] given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the equator and negative south of it{9] theoretically to define a global tropopause in this way the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface nevertheless the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical{8] for the extratropical tropopause in the northern hemisphere the wmo established a value of 15 pvu{8] but greater values ranging between 2 and 35 pvu have been traditionally used{10]it is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition{11] for example the lower stratosphere has much higher ozone concentrations than the upper troposphere but much lower water vapor concentrations so appropriate cutoffs can be usedphenomena{edit]the tropopause is not a "hard" boundary vigorous thunderstorms for example particularly those of tropical origin will overshoot into the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief (hour-order or less) low-frequency vertical oscillation{12] such oscillation sets up a low-frequency atmospheric gravity wave capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region{citation needed]most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere just above the tropopause where clouds are usually absent as also are significant weather perturbations{13]see also{edit]atmospheric sciences portaljet streammaximum parcel levelnotes{edit]^ 1xc2xa0pvuxc2xa0=xc2xa010-6xc2xa0kxc2xa0m2xc2xa0kg-1xc2xa0s-1{8]references{edit]^ international meteorological vocabulary (2nd ed) geneva: secretariat of the world meteorological organization 1992 pxc2xa0636 isbnxc2xa092-63-02182-1xc2xa0^ panchev 1985 pxc2xa0129^ hoinka k p (1999) "temperature humidity and wind at the global tropopause" monthly weather review american meteorological society 127: 2248 xe2x80x93 2265 bibcode:1999mwrv1272248h doi:1011751520-0493(1999)127<2248:thawat>20co;2xc2xa0^ gettelman a;
