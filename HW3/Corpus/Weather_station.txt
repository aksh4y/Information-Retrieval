b'weather station - wikipedia weather stationfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchweather station at mildura airport victoria australiaa weather station is a facility either on land or sea with instruments and equipment for measuring atmospheric conditions to provide information for weather forecasts and to study the weather and climate the measurements taken include temperature atmospheric pressure humidity wind speed wind direction and precipitation amounts wind measurements are taken with as few other obstructions as possible while temperature and humidity measurements are kept free from direct solar radiation or insolation manual observations are taken at least once daily while automated measurements are taken at least once an hour weather conditions out at sea are taken by ships and buoys which measure slightly different meteorological quantities such as sea surface temperature (sst) wave height and wave period drifting weather buoys outnumber their moored versions by a significant amountcontents1 instruments11 exposure2 personal weather station3 home weather station4 dedicated ships5 dedicated buoys6 synoptic weather station7 networks71

pressure air temperature and tidestypical weather stations have the following instruments:thermometer for measuring air and sea surface temperaturebarometer for measuring atmospheric pressurehygrometer for measuring humidityanemometer for measuring wind speedpyranometer for measuring solar radiationrain gauge for measuring liquid precipitation over a set period of timein addition at certain automated airport weather stations additional instruments may be employed including:present weatherprecipitation identification sensor for identifying falling precipitationdisdrometer for measuring drop size distributiontransmissometer for measuring visibilityceilometer for measuring cloud ceilingmore sophisticated stations may also measure the ultraviolet index leaf wetness soil moisture soil temperature water temperature in ponds lakes creeks or rivers and occasionally other dataexposure{edit]except for those instruments requiring direct exposure to the elements (anemometer rain gauge) the instruments should be sheltered in a vented box usually a stevenson screen to keep direct sunlight off the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer the instrumentation may be specialized to allow for periodic recording otherwise significant manual labour is required for record keeping automatic transmission of data in a format such as metar is also desirable as many weather station's data is required for weather forecastingpersonal weather station{edit]roof-mounted weather station instrumentsa personal weather station is a set of weather measuring instruments operated by a private individual club association or even business (where obtaining and distributing weather data is not a part of the entity's business operation) personal weather stations have become more advanced and can include many different sensors to measure weather conditions these sensors can vary between models but most measure wind speed wind direction outdoor and indoor temperatures outdoor and indoor humidity barometric pressure rainfall and finally uv or solar radiation other sensors that may be available can measure soil moisture soil temperature and leaf wetness the quality number of instruments and placement of personal weather stations can vary widely making the determination of which stations collect accurate meaningful and comparable data difficultpersonal weather stations also typically involve a digital console that provides readouts of the data being collected these consoles may interface to a personal computer where data can be displayed stored and uploaded to websites or data ingestiondistribution systems open source weather stations are available that are designed to be fully customizable by users{1]personal weather stations may be operated solely for the enjoyment and education of the owner however some owners share their results with others they do this by either by manually compiling data and distributing it distributing data over the internet or sharing data via amateur radio the citizen weather observer program (cwop) is a service which facilitates the sharing of information from personal weather stations this data is submitted through use of software a personal computer and internet connection (or amateur radio) and are utilized by groups such as the national weather service (nws) when generating forecast models each weather station submitting data to cwop will also have an individual web page that depicts the data submitted by that station the weather underground internet site is another popular destination for the submittal and sharing of data with others around the world as with cwop each station submitting data to weather underground has a unique web page displaying their submitted data the uk met office's weather observations website (wow) also allows such data to be shared and displayed{2]home weather station{edit]home weather stations include hygrometers thermometers barographs and barometers commonly wall mounted and made by manufacturers such as airguide taylor springfield sputnik and stormoguidethe weather ship ms polarfront at seadedicated ships{edit]main article: weather shipa weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological measurements for use in weather forecasting it was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights{3]{4] the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during world war ii that the international civil aviation organization (icao) established a global network of 13 weather ships in 1948{3] of the 12 left in operation in 1996 nine were located in the northern atlantic ocean while three were located in the northern pacific ocean the agreement of the weather ships ended in 1990 weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource{5] the last weather ship was ms polarfront known as weather station m ("jilindras") at 66xc2xb0n 02xc2xb0e run by the norwegian meteorological institute ms polarfront was removed from service january 1 2010 since the 1960s this role has been largely superseded by satellites long range aircraft and weather buoys weather observations from ships continue from thousands of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation; the old weather crowdsourcing project transcribes naval logs from before the era of dedicated shipsweather buoy operated by the noaa national data buoy centerdedicated buoys{edit]main article: weather buoyweather buoys are instruments which collect weather and oceanography data within the world's oceans and lakes{6]{7]{8] moored buoys have been in use since 1951{9] while drifting buoys have been used since the late 1970s{10] moored buoys are connected with the seabed using either chains nylon or buoyant polypropylene{11] with the decline of the weather ship they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s{12] during the 1980s and 1990s a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean helped study the el nixc3xb1o-southern oscillation{13] moored weather buoys range from 15 metres (49xc2xa0ft) to 12 metres (39xc2xa0ft) in diameter{11] while drifting buoys are smaller with diameters of 30 centimetres (12xc2xa0in) to 40 centimetres (16xc2xa0in){14] drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number with 1250 located worldwide{10] wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships{15] there are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity{16]synoptic weather station{edit]synoptic automatic weather stationsynoptic weather stations are instruments which collect meteorological information at synoptic time 00h00 06h00 12h00 18h00 (utc) and at intermediate synoptic hours 03h00 09h00 15h00 21h00 (utc)the common instruments of measure are anemometer wind vane pressure sensor thermometer hygrometer and rain gaugethe weather measures are formatted in special format and transmit to wmo to help the weather forecast modelnetworks{edit]a variety of land-based weather station networks have been set up globally some of these are basic to analyzing weather fronts and pressure systems such as the synoptic observation network while others are more regional in nature known as mesonetsglobal{edit]citizen weather observer program (cwop){17]weather underground personal weather
