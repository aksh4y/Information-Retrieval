b'arcus cloud - wikipedia arcus cloudfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchpanorama of a strong shelf cloud a type of arcus cloudunderside of a weak shelf cloudan arcus cloud is a low horizontal cloud formation usually appearing as an accessory cloud to a cumulonimbus roll clouds and shelf clouds are the two main types of arcus arcus clouds most frequently form along the leading edge or "gust fronts" of thunderstorm outflow; some of the most dramatic arcus formations mark the gust fronts of derecho-producing convective systems roll clouds also may arise in the absence of thunderstorms forming along the shallow cold air currents of some sea breeze boundaries and cold frontscontents1 types11 shelf cloud12 roll cloud2 see also3 references4 external linkstypes{edit]shelf cloud{edit]a time-lapse photography of shelf cloud just before a thunderstorm in pondicherry puducherry indiaa shelf cloud over enschede netherlandsa shelf cloud is a low horizontal wedge-shaped arcus cloud a shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent cloud which is usually a thunderstorm but could form on any type of convective clouds rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading (outer) part of the shelf cloud while the underside often appears turbulent and wind-torn cool sinking air from a storm cloud's downdraft spreads out across the land surface with the leading edge called a gust front this outflow cuts under warm air being drawn into the storm's updraft as the lower cooler air lifts the warm moist air its water condenses creating a cloud which often rolls with the different winds above and below (wind shear)people seeing a shelf cloud may believe they have seen a wall cloud this is likely a mistake since an approaching shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of cloud a shelf cloud usually appears on the leading edge of a storm and a wall cloud will usually be at the rear of the storma sharp strong gust front will cause the lowest part of the leading edge of a shelf cloud to be ragged and lined with rising fractus clouds in a severe case there will be vortices along the edge with twisting masses of scud that may reach to the ground or be accompanied by rising dust a very low shelf cloud accompanied by these signs is the best indicator that a potentially violent wind squall is approaching an extreme example of this phenomenon looks almost like a tornado and is known as a gustnado{1]roll cloud{edit]a roll cloud (cloud atlas name volutus) is a low horizontal tube-shaped and relatively rare type of arcus cloud they differ from shelf clouds by being completely detached from other cloud features roll clouds usually appear to be "rolling" about a horizontal axis they are a solitary wave called a soliton which is a wave that has a single crest and moves without changing speed or shape one of the most famous frequent occurrences is the morning glory cloud in queensland australia which can occur up to four out of ten days in october{2] one of the main causes of the morning glory cloud is the mesoscale circulation associated with sea breezes that develop over the cape york peninsula and the gulf of carpentaria however similar features can be created by downdrafts from thunderstorms and are not exclusively associated with coastal regionscoastal roll clouds have been seen in many places including california the english channel shetland islands the north sea coast coastal regions of australia and nome alaskaa roll cloud associated with a severe thunderstorm over racine wisconsin united statescoastal roll cloud in punta del este maldonado uruguay a type known as volutus{3]a sequence of volutus clouds at sea in the drake passage of the southern oceansee also{edit]atmospheric convectionhorizontal convective rolls (cloud streets)international cloud atlasmorning glory cloud an extremely long variety of roll cloudworld meteorological organizationreferences{edit]^ meteorological service of canada (december 19 2002) "gust fronts and wind squalls" severe weather watcher handbook environment canada archived from the original on june 23 2006 retrieved 2008-06-22xc2xa0^ clarke r h;
