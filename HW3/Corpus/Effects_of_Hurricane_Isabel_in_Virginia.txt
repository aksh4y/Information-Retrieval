to be the costliest disaster in the history of virginia{1] hurricane isabel formed from a tropical wave on september 6 2003 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265xc2xa0kmh (165xc2xa0mph) on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 165xc2xa0kmh (105xc2xa0mph) on september 18 it quickly weakened over land as it passed through central virginia and isabel became extratropical over western pennsylvania on september 19strong winds from the hurricane affected 99xc2xa0counties and cities in the state{1]{2] which downed thousands of trees and left about 18xc2xa0million without power the storm surge impacted much of the southeastern portion of the state peaking at around 9xc2xa0feet (27xc2xa0m) in richmond along the james river; the surge caused significant damage to homes along riverways the nationwide maximum rainfall total from the hurricane was 202xc2xa0inches (513xc2xa0mm) in sherando virginia in the state's mountainous region heavy rainfall caused severe and damaging flash flooding the hurricane caused about 185xc2xa0billion (2003xc2xa0usd 217xc2xa0billion 2008xc2xa0usd) in damage and 36xc2xa0deaths in the statexe2x80x9410xc2xa0directly from the storm's effects and 26xc2xa0indirectly related{3]contents1 preparations2 impact21 hampton roads metropolitan area and delmarva peninsula22 northern23 central and southwest24 shenandoah valley3 aftermath4 see also5 referencespreparations{edit]by four days before isabel made landfall most weather models predicted isabel to make landfall between north carolina and new jersey{4]{5] initially forecasters predicted it to move along the coastline of the chesapeake bay{4] though as the hurricane neared land the predicted track was much closer to where it ultimately was the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch from the north carolinavirginia border to chincoteague near its border with maryland about 50xc2xa0hours before isabel struck land including the southern portion of the chesapeake bay 18xc2xa0hours before the hurricane made landfall the national hurricane center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the entire coastline{6] additionally inland hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for south-central virginia the wakefield national weather service office issued three tornado warnings for four counties though none became tornadoes the office also issued two county-wide flood warnings and 43 flood warnings and flood statements for various river basins{7]the virginia emergency management agency was activated on september 15 about three days prior to isabel making landfall and entering the state officials in hampton issued the first mandatory evacuation in the state on september 17 about 35xc2xa0hours prior to landfall elevenxc2xa0hours later a mandatory evacuation was issued for some residents in chesapeake norfolk and virginia beach with a recommended evacuation for some residents in the city of suffolk and isle of wight northumberland richmond and york counties later on september 17 governor mark warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory by the time isabel entered virginia late on september 18 evacuations were also issued for accomack county chincoteague gloucester county lancaster county mathews county newport news poquoson portsmouth and westmoreland county the zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts in areas prone to flooding potentially affected by storm surge from a category 2 hurricane low-lying areas health care facilities or islands the tools officials used to determine the evacuation zones included shelter locations the slosh storm surge model evacuation maps and clearance times{8]despite the orders a relatively small number of people evacuated for the hurricane according to a telephone survey conducted by the united states department of commerce the highest participation rate was for residents in the northern neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane of which 41 in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location in surry only 9 of those in a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane storm surge zone left 30 who participated in the survey along the eastern shore left the primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of isabel its strength or influence from the media most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location however of those who evacuated about 64 left for the house of a friend or a relative with about 24 evacuating to a hotel or a motel most of those in hampton and norfolk left for elsewhere in the state while the majority of those in the northern neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community the evacuation destinations on the eastern shore of virginia were varied with 23 leaving for maryland and 46 staying in their own neighborhood or community the length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads{8] the virginia army national guard and state police troopers assisted in the evacuations{9] in all more than 160000 residents in southeastern virginia were told
