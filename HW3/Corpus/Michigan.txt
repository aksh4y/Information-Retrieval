peninsula to which the name michigan was originally applied is often noted to be shaped like a mitten the upper peninsula (often referred to as "the up") is separated from the lower peninsula by the straits of mackinac a five-mile (8xc2xa0km) channel that joins lake huron to lake michigan the two peninsulas are connected by the mackinac bridge the state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world being bounded by four of the five great lakes plus lake saint clair{8] as a result it is one of the leading us states for recreational boating{9]michigan also has

the region came under british rule and was ceded to the newly independent united states after britain's defeat in the american revolutionary war the area was part of the larger northwest territory until 1800 when western michigan became part of the indiana territory in 1805 the michigan territory was formed and in 1837 was admitted into the union as the 26th state it soon became an important center of industry and trade in the great lakes region and a popular immigrant destinationalthough michigan has come to develop a diverse economy it is widely known as the center of the us automotive industry being home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all within the detroit metropolitan area) while sparsely populated the upper peninsula is important for

europeans to reach what became michigan were those of xc3x89tienne brxc3xbblxc3xa9's expedition in 1622 the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where pxc3xa8re jacques marquette established sault ste marie michigan as a base for catholic missions{12]{13] missionaries in 1671xe2x80x9375 founded outlying stations at saint ignace and marquette jesuit missionaries were

established a trading post and fort st joseph along the st joseph river at the present day city of niles18th centuryapproximate area of michigan highlighted in guillaume de l'isle's 1718 mapin 1701 french explorer and army officer antoine de la mothe cadillac founded fort pontchartrain du dxc3xa9troit or "fort pontchartrain on-the-strait" on the strait known as the detroit river between lakes saint clair and erie cadillac had convinced king louis xiv's chief minister louis phxc3xa9lypeaux comte de pontchartrain that a permanent community there would strengthen french control over the upper great lakes and discourage british aspirationsthe hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent{14]{15] (about 085 acres (3400xc2xa0m2) the equivalent of just under 200 feet (61xc2xa0m) per side) and named it fort pontchartrain cadillac's wife marie thxc3xa9rxc3xa8se guyon soon moved to detroit becoming one of the first european women to settle in the michigan wilderness the town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post the xc3x89glise de saint-anne (church of saint ann) was founded the same year while the original building does not survive the congregation continues to be active today cadillac later departed to serve as the french governor of louisiana from 1710 to 1716 french attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the fox wars involving the meskwaki (fox) and their allies versus the french and their native alliesat the same time the french strengthened fort michilimackinac at the straits of mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire by the mid-18th century the french also occupied forts at present-day niles and sault ste marie though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by europeans france offered free land to attract families to detroit which grew to 800 people in 1765 the largest city between montreal and new orleans{16]the province of quebec in 1774from 1660 until the end of french rule michigan was part of the royal province of new france{c] in 1760 montreal fell to the british forces ending the french and indian war (1754xe2x80x931763) under the 1763 treaty of paris michigan and the rest of new france east of the mississippi river passed to great britain{17] after the quebec act was passed in 1774 michigan became part of the british province of quebec by 1778 detroit's population was up to 2144 and it was the third largest city in quebec{18]during the american revolutionary war detroit was an important british supply center most of the inhabitants were french-canadians or native americans many of whom had been allied with the french because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 treaty of paris the british retained control of detroit and michigan after the american revolution when quebec split into lower and upper canada in 1791 michigan was part of kent county upper canada it held its first democratic elections in august 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at newark (now niagara-on-the-lake){19]under terms negotiated in the 1794 jay treaty britain withdrew from detroit and michilimackinac in 1796 questions remained over the boundary for many years and the united states did not have uncontested control of the upper peninsula and drummond island until 1818 and 1847 respectively19th centuryduring the war of 1812 michigan territory (effectively consisting of detroit and the surrounding area) was surrendered after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812 an attempt to retake detroit resulted in a severe american defeat in the river raisin massacre this battle is still the bloodiest ever fought in the state and had the highest number of american casualties of any battle in the war ultimately michigan was recaptured by americans in 1813 after the battle of lake erie an invasion of canada which culminated in the battle of the thames was then launched from michigan the more northern areas were held by the british until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries a number of forts including fort wayne were built in michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with britainlumbering pines in the late 1800sthe population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the erie canal connecting the great lakes and the hudson river and new york city the new route brought a large influx of settlers who became farmers and merchants and shipped out grain lumber and iron ore by the 1830s michigan had 80000 residents more than enough to apply and qualify for statehooda constitutional convention of assent led by gershom mott williams was held to lead the territory to statehood{20] in october 1835 the people approved the constitution of 1835 thereby forming a state government although congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with ohio known as the toledo war congress awarded the "toledo strip" to ohio michigan received the western part of the upper peninsula as a concession and formally entered the union on january 26 1837 the upper peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber iron and copper michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward with detroit the chief huba second wave of french canadian immigrants settled in michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century particularly in lumbering areas in counties on the lake huron side of the lower peninsula such as the saginaw valley
