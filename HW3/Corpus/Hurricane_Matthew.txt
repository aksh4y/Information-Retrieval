2007 caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti and also spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005 matthew was the thirteenth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier at one point the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005 but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastlineoriginating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on septemberxc2xa022 matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on septemberxc2xa028 it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on septemberxc2xa029 before undergoing explosive intensification ultimately reaching categoryxc2xa05 intensity on octoberxc2xa01 at just 134xc2xb0n latitude xe2x80x93 the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004{1] matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles remaining a strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti's tiburon peninsula early on octoberxc2xa04 and then a second one in cuba later that day matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest making landfall in the northern bahamas the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras north carolina on octoberxc2xa09{2]widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path however the most significant impacts were felt in haiti with us19xc2xa0billion in damage and 546xc2xa0deaths making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80 of jxc3xa9rxc3xa9mie sustained significant damage four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse and total losses in the country amounted to us258xc2xa0billion most of which occurred in the guantxc3xa1namo province passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane matthew spread damage across several islands grand bahama was hit directly where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area in florida over 1xc2xa0million lost power as the storm passed to the east with 478000xc2xa0losing power in georgia and south carolina while damage was primarily confined to the coast

to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic being monitored by the national hurricane center (nhc) for possible tropical cyclogenesis despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27 the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center however by 12:00xc2xa0utc on september 28 the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados hence becoming a tropical storm and was assigned the name matthew continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa029 the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day and matthew began a period of explosive intensification; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa030 the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled from 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) to 165xc2xa0mph (270xc2xa0kmh) making matthew a category 5 hurricane{1] the first since hurricane felix in 2007;{3] the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began due to upwelling of cooler waters matthew weakened to a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane later on octoberxc2xa01 before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155xc2xa0mph (250xc2xa0kmh) late on october 2{1]slowly rounding the ridge matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from octoberxc2xa01xe2x80x935 intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais haiti around 11:00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) and a pressure of 934 millibars (276xc2xa0inhg) making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 continuing northward the hurricane struck maisxc3xad in cuba early on octoberxc2xa05 as a slightly weaker storm cuba's and haiti's mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas restrengthening occurred as matthew's circulation became better organized with the storm becoming a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane again while passing freeport however matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane (with the strongest winds remaining just offshore) matthew weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane late on octoberxc2xa07 and then to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane by 12:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa08{1]the eye of hurricane matthew seen from the international space station on october 3around 15:00xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa08 the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge near mcclellanville south carolina with winds of 85xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) and a central pressure of 963xc2xa0mbar (284xc2xa0inhg) which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954{nb 1]{4]{1] convection
