poverty bay wairarapa-bush wanganui and wellington unions and currently plays at westpac stadium having previously played at the now-defunct athletic park{1]{2]the hurricanes were formed to represent the lower north island with the conception of the super 12 competition in 1996 which featured teams from new zealand south africa and australia the hurricanes had a poor first season but rebounded in 1997 with a third placing the team did not reach the play-offs for another five years as the team struggled in the bottom four of the table since 2003 the hurricanes have made the post-season play-offs seven times out of the last fourteen seasons; including the 2006 final which they lost in horrendously foggy weather against the crusaders 19xe2x80x9312 after hosting but failing to win the final in 2015 the 2016 season was the hurricanes best season to date they won the super rugby final 20-3 against the lions after again finishing the regular season first and hosting the finalcontents1

references11 external linkshistory{edit]early years: 1996xe2x80x9397{edit]the hurricanes were formed in 1996 as one of five new zealand super 12 teams and were originally called the "wellington hurricanes" the team's first coach was former all black frank oliver while bull allen was named as captain their first match played at palmerston north showgrounds against the auckland blues was the first ever super rugby match they lost it 36xe2x80x9328 the team performed below expectations in the inaugural year of the competition and finished ninth in 1997 the team made the semi-finals losing in canberra to the act brumbies however the consistent form shown during this season would not be seen again for many yearsexpect the unexpected: 1998xe2x80x932002{edit]following their 1997 season the hurricanes failed to qualify for the semi-finals until 2003 despite this they were still known for the attacking nature of their backline that included the all blacks stars tana umaga and christian cullen the team played with flair and could score at any moment whatever their position on the field giving rise to the teams catch cry of 'expect the unexpected' however the team struggled for consistent performances and at crunch time in matches leading to patchy form and resultsafter the 1999 world cup jonah lomu's contract with the nzru expired he was linked to many clubs around the world in rugby league as well as union and also the nfl's dallas cowboys{3] on 23 november 1999 it was announced that the winger had resigned from the nzru and agreed terms with the wellington rugby union despite a reported a xc2xa311xc2xa0million offer by bristol{3]{4] the move to the wellington union meant he could be included in the protected group of players for the hurricanesthe hurricanes also opened 2000 with a new stadium the highlights of that year included the victory over eventual champions the crusaders 41xe2x80x9329 in front of a packed house at the end of the season the 'canes still had a mathematical chance of making the semis and only had to beat the bulls to stay in contention however the hurricanes played one of their worst games of the year losing the match to one of the worst performing teams at that point in the competition's history and lost the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals the team finished eighth on the tabledespite the wellington lions (whom most of the hurricanes squad were chosen from) winning the 2000 npc{5] the hurricanes finished ninth in the final standings in 2001; one worse than the year before another ninth placing in 2002 resulted in graham mourie who had led the team since 2000 resigning{6]new era: since 2003{edit]this section needs expansion with: information from 2006 onward you can help by adding to it (september 2011)the hurricanes playing the highlanders at westpac stadium in 2006in spite of reports that colin cooper the then crusaders assistant-coach had said he was "not yet ready to jump ship" and wanted to stay with the south island franchise{7] the hurricanes were able to lure him away from the champions and made him their head coach for the 2003 seasoncooper along with newly appointed captain tana umaga helped to mould the inconsistent and ill-disciplined hurricanes into one of the top teams in the competition{8] 2003 was the beginning of a new era for the hurricanes as they reached the semi-finals for just the second time in their history on the back of a strong seven-game winning streak mid-season their success came partly with the break-out year for mid-fielder ma'a nonu his strong performances and partnership with captain tana umaga pushed out former all black pita alatini and saw him score six tries en route to the all black squad the team also benefited from the steady hand of david holwell at first five-eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack hurricanes stalwart christian cullen would leave new zealand shores for irish club munster after his omission from the all blacks 2003 world cup squad despite scoring eight tries during the seasonall black great jonah lomu was left out of the 2004 squad due to a life-threatening illness that would eventually result in a kidney transplant he would never again play for the hurricanesthe majority of the team was retained< for 2005{9] including new centre conrad smith{10] the hurricanes came back in 2005 to the form that saw them make the playoffs two years prior former new zealand colt flyhalf jimmy gopperth was the real "find" of the season scoring 139 points which helped offset the departure of david holwell to ireland the hurricanes had tried to sign australian playmaker brock james who had starred the previous npc season for taranaki{11] and the blues and young star luke mcalister indicated that he would like to play in wellington{12] with both daniel carter and aaron mauger at the crusaders capable of playing first five-eighth the team also made an attempt to lure andrew mehrtens to wellington without successin 2006 two new teams entered the competition the bloemfontein-based cheetahs from south africa and the perth-based western force from australia creating the super 14 rodney so'oialo was appointed captain of the hurricanes to succeed former all black captain tana umaga{13] the team won all but four matches they made their first super rugby final but lost to the crusaders in a match played under thick fog following the match there was an incident in a nightclub involving chris masoe and tana umaga the club finances benefitted from on-pitch success with nz136xc2xa0million profit on its 2006 turnover of nz744xc2xa0millionthe hurricanes returned to the semi-finals in both 2008 and 2009 however were unable to capture the same success in subsequent seasons{14] 2011 saw the arrival of mark hammett as coach and the departure of andrew hore ma'a nonu and piri weeputhe hurricanes finished 11th in the 2013 super rugby season2015 saw the hurricanes finish first in the regular season topping the table with 66 points and a win-loss record of 14xe2x80x932 in round robin play the hurricanes picked up the new zealand conference trophy after beating the highlanders after beating the brumbies in the semi-final the hurricanes lost the final against the highlanders 21xe2x80x9314 it was the final super rugby match for conrad smith ma'a nonu and

outside of wellington due to its shape it was opened in 2000 to replace athletic park where the team had been previously based central energy trust arena in palmerston north and mclean park in napier have also played host to hurricanes matchesin the initial years of the competition the hurricanes played once or occasionally twice away from their wellington base depending on whether they had five or six games per year such a policy was welcomed given the large geographic area that the team was drawn from however in recent years the team has seldom ventured from wellington despite the expansion
