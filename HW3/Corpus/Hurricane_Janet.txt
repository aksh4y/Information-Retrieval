seasonhurricane janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest atlantic hurricanes on record the eleventh tropical storm ninth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the year{nb 1] janet formed from a tropical wave east of the lesser antilles on septemberxc2xa021 moving westward across the caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane with winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh) the intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on septemberxc2xa028 after weakening over the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula it moved into the bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on septemberxc2xa029 janet quickly weakened over mexico's mountainous terrain before dissipating on septemberxc2xa030in its developmental stages janet caused 78xc2xa0million in damage to the lesser antilles and 189xc2xa0deaths in the grenadines and barbados{nb 2] while janet was in the central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed to be perished this remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane a categoryxc2xa05 upon landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas of quintana roo and british honduras only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after the storm and an estimated 500xc2xa0deaths occurred in the mexican state of quintana roo at janet's second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the month the floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326xc2xa0people in the tampico area leading to the largest mexican relief operation ever executed by the united statesjanet's landfall as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula was the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland; prior to janet landfalls of categoryxc2xa05 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands{2] janet's minimum barometric pressure recorded in chetumal was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the atlantic behind the 1935 labor day hurricane at least 1023xc2xa0deaths were attributed to hurricane janet as well as 658xc2xa0million in damages the name janet was later retired from the atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific research communitycontents1 meteorological history2 preparations21 caribbean islands22 yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and

notes7 referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the air france and iberia airlines east of the lesser antilles early on septemberxc2xa021 although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a tropical wave near cape verde the weather bureau considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from the islands{3] at 1800xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa021 while it was located 350xc2xa0mi (565xc2xa0km) east-southeast of martinique{4]{5] the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the weather bureau to classify it as tropical storm janet the tenth named storm of the season{5] upon classification janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west{4]{6] on septemberxc2xa022 janet attained hurricane strength and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across the windward islands{3] by 1200xc2xa0utc that day janet already attained categoryxc2xa03 hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) before stalling in intensification{4]shortly after 1700xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa022 the eye of janet passed over barbados{7] a reconnaissance flight into the hurricane discovered that the hurricane janet's eye measured only 20xc2xa0mi (32xc2xa0km) in diameter{3] with gale force winds extending 120xc2xa0mi (190xc2xa0km) away from the center of circulation{6] the flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2891xc2xa0inhg) after passing between the islands of grenada and carriacou in the morning hours of septemberxc2xa023 janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern caribbean sea{3] as a result the hurricane became disorganized with winds weakening to 90xc2xa0mph (145xc2xa0kmh) by 1200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa023{4]{3] a us navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on septemberxc2xa024 reporting a lack of organization and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands{3] however the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions regaining major hurricane strength by 1200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa024 and subsequently category 4xc2xa0hurricane intensity by the next day{6]{4]graph of barometer readings in chetumalwhile trekking across the central caribbean sea janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the windward islands with gale force winds extending 125xc2xa0mi (200xc2xa0km) out from the center by septemberxc2xa025{6] remaining a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the caribbean a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of septemberxc2xa025xe2x80x9326 indicated strong rainbands with frequent lightning strikes and a well-defined eye evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying{3] as it neared the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula on septemberxc2xa026 janet began accelerating in forward speed{6] after the reconnaissance flight snowcloud five was lost while making a penetration into the hurricane's eye another flight early on septemberxc2xa027 reported a minimum pressure of 938xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2770xc2xa0inhg) with winds in excess of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) "by a large and incalculable amount"{3] the hurricane was estimated to have intensified to categoryxc2xa05 hurricane intensityxe2x80x94the highest rating on the modern day saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scalexe2x80x94at 1200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa027 while in the western caribbean sea janet continued to intensify afterwards eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh){4] with gale force winds having expanded to at least 250xc2xa0mi (400xc2xa0km) away from the center of the hurricane{6] janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over the swan islands before making landfall in extreme southern quintana roo mexico just east of chetumal mexico in that city a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 914xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2700xc2xa0inhg) in the eye of janet{3] at the time this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling atlantic hurricane behind the 1935 labor day hurricane{3] though janet was later surpassed by hurricanes dean and gilbert which also made landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula as categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes{8]once over land janet considerably weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane with winds of 105xc2xa0mph (170xc2xa0kmh) after crossing the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula with a forward speed of 21xc2xa0mph (34xc2xa0kmh) the hurricane emerged into the bay of campeche by 1600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa028{4]{6] the weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the bay of campeche to a secondary peak intensity of 110xc2xa0mph (175xc2xa0kmh) with a minimum central pressure of 950xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2806xc2xa0inhg){4] janet eventually made its final landfall 50xc2xa0mi (80xc2xa0km) north of the city of veracruz by 2200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa029 as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane after moving inland the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of mexico and as a result the weather bureau issued its last advisory on janet{6] the weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by septemberxc2xa030 and later dissipated over central mexico by 0600xc2xa0utc that day{4] janet's remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on octoberxc2xa01{6]preparations{edit]caribbean islands{edit]upon janet's formation east of the windward islands the weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution after a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested hurricane warnings were issued at 1600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa022 for the entirety of the lesser antilles from saint lucia to grenada including barbados storm warnings were issued for all islands in the windward islands from saint lucia south to tobago excluding st vincent and the grenadines all warnings in the windward antilles remained in effect until 1000xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa022 shortly after warnings were lowered in the windward islands storm warnings were issued for the abc islands and the paraguanxc3xa1 peninsula of venezuela at 0200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa023 after janet passed north of the islands all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of septemberxc2xa025 the weather bureau later warned interests in jamaica but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island{6]yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and mexico{edit]the weather bureau first began cautioning areas of central america at 1600xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa026 advising people in areas of northeast nicaragua and honduras to take precautionary measures along with all vessels and small craft in the gulf of honduras south to cabo gracias a dios after janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest advisories warned areas in british honduras and quintana roo of hurricane-related impacts though no official warnings were issued for areas of central america advisories published by the weather bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall{6] evacuations took place in several coastal towns in quintana roo upon notification of the oncoming storm people were evacuated to inland hillside shelters{9] after the hurricane moved through the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula and entered the bay of campeche the weather bureau alerted areas in the storm's path on the western side of mexico's gulf coast at the time janet was expected to make landfall between veracruz and tuxpan areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts the weather bureau advised all small craft south of port o'connor texas to remain in port notifications of janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall{6]impact{edit]deaths and damage by regionregiontotaldeathsdamage(usd)source(s)barbados387006500000000000000xe2x99xa05xc2xa0million{3]{10]british

of differing sources totals may not matchduring its existence areas of the lesser antilles abc islands and central america were affected by janet{6] at least 658xc2xa0million in damages and 1023xc2xa0deaths were caused by the hurricane mostly in quintana roo{3]{12]{13] the large number of deaths and damage caused by janet helped make the 1955xc2xa0atlantic hurricane season the deadliest and costliest hurricane season documented since comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942{3]lesser antilles{edit]as a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane janet passed just south of barbados on septemberxc2xa022 becoming the first hurricane to strike the island in 57xc2xa0years since the 1898 windward islands hurricane maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110xe2x80x93120xc2xa0mph (180xe2x80x93190xc2xa0kmh){3] the strong winds knocked out communication lines preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island{14] though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio{15] electric power was later restored allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm{16] sugar cane the island country's main source of revenue was severely damaged with losses estimated to be in excess of 1xc2xa0million{14] poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds{17] an estimated 8100xc2xa0homes were damaged by the hurricane{18] the destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways{17] and the seawell airport was forced to close{19] heavy rains peaked at 4xc2xa0in (100xc2xa0mm) and a storm surge of 7xc2xa0ft (21xc2xa0m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast{9] an estimated 2000xc2xa0people were left homeless due to the hurricane{10] property damage on barbados was estimated to be 5xc2xa0million{10] and at least 57xc2xa0people were killed{13]on septemberxc2xa023 janet passed directly between grenada and carriacou in the grenadines killing 122xc2xa0people in the island chain{3] an airport on grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to the airport strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses and unroofed a hotel in st george's grenada{20] houses were also unroofed and balconies of government offices in st george's were torn off{21] all bridges in the island's interior regions collapsed{22] and spice crops sustained heavy damage{23] an estimated 75 of nutmeg plantations were destroyed{24] along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops{25] three ships were also grounded in the local harbor{23] in the carenage the waterfront region of st george's debris was scattered and an 820xc2xa0ft (250xc2xa0m) pier collapsed{24] st vincent was mostly destroyed{26] and st lucia suffered significant coastal damage{27] over 28xc2xa0million in damages were estimated throughout the grenadines{3] farther south in port of spain a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed killing ten people{12]hurricane janet skirted the abc islands with strong winds as it passed to the north from septemberxc2xa024xe2x80x9325{4] in aruba gusts peaked at 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) uprooting trees however damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant in bonaire piers were destroyed and the island's coastal boulevard was damaged beach facilities at curaxc3xa7ao's piscadera and vaersen bays suffered considerable damage quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged{28]snowcloud five{edit]on septemberxc2xa026 the hurricane hunter p2v-3w neptune aircraft snowcloud five led by us navy lieutenant commander grover b windham was sent from guantxc3xa1namo bay to investigate janet which was at the time a categoryxc2xa04 hurricane south of jamaica{29] upon penetration of the hurricane's eyewall at an altitude of 700xc2xa0ft (200xc2xa0m) a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the caribbean sea{30] all 11xc2xa0people on board including nine crew members and two journalists were killed{30] following the loss of the plane an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the caribbean sea with 3000xc2xa0personnel involved with the search returning no results{29] the exact cause of the crash remains unknown though it is speculated that the plane's altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure{30] although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943 snowcloud five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the atlantic basin with the other three occurring as a result of pacific typhoons{31]yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{edit]damage in corozal townas it approached the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula janet passed over the swan islands north of honduras as a categoryxc2xa05 hurricane on septemberxc2xa027{4] the hurricane caused rough seas and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas after gusts exceeded an estimated 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) officials on the islands took shelter in a navy seismograph building{3]{32] though no deaths were reported janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands the us weather bureau and civil aeronautics authority requested food and supplies for 82xc2xa0people on the island after the storm passed{33]quintana roo{edit]after passing the swan islands janet made landfall on the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula between corozal town british honduras and chetumal mexico at 1700xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa028{3] at the time it had winds of 175xc2xa0mph (280xc2xa0kmh){4] hurricane force winds were reported for two hours preceding the hurricane's landfall with numerous pressure readings below 948xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2800xc2xa0inhg){3] roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to janet{34] in xcalak quintana roo the strong winds from janet flattened the port's infrastructure and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage{35] 97xc2xa0people were killed in xcalak constituting more than a third of the port's population{36] chetumal mexico was devastated with only four buildings left standing storm surge pushed water to a depth of 65xc2xa0feet (2xc2xa0m) 1600xc2xa0ft (490xc2xa0m) inland despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean the death toll in chetumal remains uncertain; 120xc2xa0bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found{3] an additional 10000xc2xa0people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane and were forced to sleep in the open overnight{37] federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the gulf coast of mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{38] in quintana roo hurricane janet was estimated to have caused 40xc2xa0million in damages and at least 500xc2xa0deaths the most of any region affected by janet{3]british honduras{edit]making landfall near the border between mexico and british honduras the latter colony's corozal and orange walk districts containing a population of 15500xc2xa0at the time experienced severe devastation from janet strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across british honduras particularly in the freshwater creek forest preserve there an estimated 30xc2xa0of all trees had been damaged especially mahogany and sapodilla trees hurricane janet also caused extensive damage to crops with an estimated 2631xc2xa0million in damages fruit trees maize and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage sugar cane was expected to have a 20xc2xa0decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses to a lesser extent the hurricane also affected the belize district and several of british honduras' offshore cayes similar to corozal and orange walk districts corn trees and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop{39]in corozal town british honduras south of where janet made landfall 500xc2xa0people were made homeless and six people were killed{40] about 90xc2xa0of all buildings in the town were destroyed{41] and communications were knocked out by the strong winds{40] based on an average home cost of 2000 it was estimated that property damage to homes in corozal town totaled 800000{39] much of santa elena british honduras was also flattened by the strong winds{37] farther south in belize city winds peaked at 60xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) though no damage was reported{42] in british honduras the hurricane's effects were less deadly than in quintana roo{43] but in northern portions of the colony the storm killed 16xc2xa0people and caused 5xc2xa0million in damages{3]mainland mexico{edit]helicopter observing flood damage in tampicowhile in the bay of campeche the shrimp boat celestino arias was sunken by strong waves generated by janet after it suffered engine failures the stranded ship was heavily damaged by the hurricane's strong winds in the bay which broke towing lines all of the ship's crewmen which had evacuated the boat after it sunk were later rescued and brought back to tampa florida{44] along the coast tides were reported to be 3xe2x80x934xc2xa0ft (091xe2x80x9312xc2xa0m) above average farther north along the texas coast tides were 2xc2xa0ft (061xc2xa0m) above average blocking beach roads near corpus christi{45]janet made its final landfall in the mexican state of veracruz between the cities of nautla and veracruz as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane at 2200xc2xa0utc on septemberxc2xa029{4] in nautla communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane{46] the strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash causing five deaths{47] heavy rains in the tampico tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year the resulting flood was reported by the weather bureau office in new orleans to be one of the worst natural disasters in mexican history{3] in tampico 16xc2xa0in (410xc2xa0mm) of rain was reported{48] the floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak{49]{50] causing over 1000xc2xa0people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases an additional 36000xc2xa0people were being cared for in concentration centers{50] although located south of where janet made landfall areas of veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge including the city's main streets and port{46] operations along a railroad stretching from laredo texas to mexico city were stopped after having just reopened due to hurricane hilda{51]farther inland as janet dissipated over the mountainous central mexico the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the tamisi and panuco river basins{52] the water levels in the panuco river remained above flood stage for four weeks{53] in tampico the river flooded neighborhoods forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away small boats were also sent to monitor streets{54] according to some sources 800xc2xa0people died from the floods with thousands more being stranded in the city{52] tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing moctezuma river{55] the rains caused a landslide in colonia san rafael killing 12xc2xa0people{47] heavy rains also impacted guadalajara which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year in maltarana jalisco the lerma and duero rivers overflowed forcing 800xc2xa0people in the town to evacuate{54] farther north in sonora cotton crops damaged by janet were estimated to amount to 12xc2xa0million in damages{56] combined property damage in mexico from hurricanes gladys hilda and janet was estimated to total 200xc2xa0million nearly half of the government's 1955xc2xa0national budget{57] although there were no official damage or fatality estimates{3] at least 1000xc2xa0people were injured and another 100000xc2xa0people were made homeless on the mexican mainland due to janet{58]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesneighborhood being rebuilt in barbadoslesser antilles{edit]after janet passed barbados the island was declared a state of emergency{16] relief workers on barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways and the local government made requests for food and construction materials{59] the extensive damaged caused by janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955xc2xa0housing act which created the national housing authority (nha) in 1956 the nha was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage the newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck{60]in grenada the island's governor issued an emergency order against the hoarding of food in the aftermath of janet due to the food and water shortage that resulted from janet a united states destroyer and a british frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to grenada and ships departing from jamaica and trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies{61] the british government later announced that it would send xc2xa350000 (us155000) in relief to the grenadines{nb 3]{63] the crown agents and red cross delivered relief supplies to barbados and the grenadines which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators{64]british honduras and mexico{edit]relief and reconstruction measures were enacted in the british honduras beginning on septemberxc2xa030{39] a large-scale reconstruction program was initiated by the government to help rebuild 48xc2xa0villages{65] the government also declared a state of emergency for corozal orange walk and belize administrative districts including a ban on liquor sales temporary communication lines were rebuilt which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas due to the severity of the damage in corozal an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently food depots in corozal louisville and orange walk town were tasked with distributing food the potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas{39] the jamaican government sent xc2xa320000 (us55000) to the colony in relief funds{64] while the british government sent xc2xa340000 (us110000) to affected areas in the british honduras and other affected islands in the caribbean the united states sent the cargo ship uss antares which supplied the colony with various relief materials{39] in corozal town a 35xc2xa0million grant was given to land surveyor hc fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township{66]a us navy relief plane was sent to chetumal mexico to deliver food and other relief supplies after janet struck the region{67] in areas previously affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the yucatxc3xa1n peninsula{38] however after crossing the bay of campeche and making landfall near veracruz relief measures were once again implemented in the western gulf coast of mexico the mexican air force commercial and private planes and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees{68] the united states initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in mexico at the time various government and relief agencies including the american red cross and the salvation army participated in the relief efforts{69] the united states air force and united states army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the tampico area beginning with the deployment of a curtiss c-46 commando from the harlingen air force base on octoberxc2xa01{47] ten other military transport aircraft from the united states air force were sent from texas to provide food and clothing pan american world airways sent a boeing 314 from miami florida to evacuate victims{56] helicopters were sent from the uss saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier other ships also aided in delivering supplies{70] including the uss siboney which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts by octoberxc2xa06 1500xc2xa0people were estimated to have been rescued from the tampico area and at least 280000xc2xa0lb (130000xc2xa0kg) of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the us air force to the city{56] there typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure{11] former president manuel xc3x81vila camacho died of a heart ailment in part due to over-exertion in helping in the relief efforts{71]due to its large swath of destruction the name janet was retired by the weather bureau becoming just the seventh atlantic tropical cyclone to have its name retired and the fourth to be retired in 1955{72]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of atlantic hurricaneslist of category 5 atlantic hurricaneshurricane
