university of tulsa these teams are referred to as the tulsa golden hurricane (or variously as hurricane tu or tulsa) before adopting the name golden hurricane in 1922 the university of tulsa (tu) had many unofficial team nicknames including kendallites (from tu's predecessor institution henry kendall college) presbyterians (from the university's founding by the presbyterian church) tulsans tigers orange and black and yellow jackets the name "golden tornadoes" was chosen by tu football coach hm archer (1922xe2x80x9324) based on new gold and black uniforms (rather than the previous orange and black) and a remark made during practice of the team "roaring through opponents" (during a season when tu went undefeated including wins over texas am and the university of arkansas) however it was quickly discovered that the same name had been chosen in 1917 by georgia tech archer then substituted the term "hurricane" for "tornado" and a team vote prior to leaving for the game against texas am confirmed the official nickname as "golden hurricane"{4]contents1 varsity sports11 football12 basketball13 men's soccer14 tennis15 women's golf16 men's golf17 baseball18 other sports19 mascot2
