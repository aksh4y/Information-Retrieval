seasons2007 2008 2009 2010 2011the 2009 atlantic hurricane season was a below-average atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes{1]{nb 1] it officially began on junexc2xa01 and ended on novemberxc2xa030 dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the atlantic basin{3] the season's first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on mayxc2xa028{4] while the final storm hurricane ida dissipated on novemberxc2xa010{5] the most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that affected areas from the leeward islands to newfoundland{6] the season featured the lowest number of tropical cyclones since the 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in the united states forming from the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on the florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of 45xc2xa0mph (75xc2xa0kmh) before quickly dissipating over alabama the storm killed two people and caused 228000 (2009 usd) in damagepre-season forecasts issued by colorado state university (csu) called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status{nb 2] the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in the projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by the middle of the seasonseveral storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of the united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of the caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to the island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected the us state of north carolina and erika affected the lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected the cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm

(14xc2xa0named storms 7xc2xa0hurricanes 3xc2xa0of categoryxc2xa03 or higher and ace index of 125) on aprilxc2xa07 2009 klotzbach's team issued an updated forecast for the 2009xc2xa0season predicting near-average activity (12xc2xa0named storms 6xc2xa0hurricanes 2xc2xa0of categoryxc2xa03 or higher and ace index of 100) citing the possible cause as the high probability of a weak el nixc3xb1o forming during the season{9] on mayxc2xa021 2009 noaa issued their forecast for the season predicting near or slightly above average activity (9 to 14xc2xa0named storms 4 to 7xc2xa0hurricanes and 1 to 3xc2xa0of categoryxc2xa03 or higher){10]midseason outlooks{edit]on junexc2xa02 2009 klotzbach's team issued another updated forecast for the 2009 season predicting slightly below average activity (11 named storms 5xc2xa0hurricanes 2 of categoryxc2xa03 or higher and ace index of 85) also on junexc2xa02 2009 the florida state university center for ocean-atmospheric prediction studies (fsu coaps) issued its first ever atlantic hurricane season forecast the fsu coaps forecast predicted 8 named storms including 4 hurricanes and an ace index of 65{11] on junexc2xa018 2009 the uk met office (ukmo) issued a forecast of 6xc2xa0tropical storms in the july to november period with a 70 chance that the number would be in the rangexc2xa03 to 9 they also predicted an ace index of 60 with a

season nine of the eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone-related incidents and total losses reached roughly 77xc2xa0million most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly 50xc2xa0million in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants{1] in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly 10xc2xa0million in losses{14] the hurricane also produced tropical storm-force winds in bermuda{6] hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence{15] the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace; however both areas recorded only minor effects{16]overall the season's activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ace) rating of 53 the lowest since 1997{17] due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short-lived the overall ace value was ranked as below-average totaling under 66{18] hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30 above average{19] ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34xc2xa0knots (39xc2xa0mph 63xc2xa0kmh) or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total{20]systems{edit]tropical depression one{edit]tropical

(2009)during mid-may a frontal boundary stalled near the bahamas and slowly degenerated on mayxc2xa025 2009 an area of low pressure developed along the tail-end of a decaying cold front near the northern bahamas tracking northward this low gradually developed as it moved within 85xc2xa0mi (140xc2xa0km) of north carolina's outer banks by mayxc2xa028 deep convection developed across a small area over the low pressure system leading to the national hurricane center classifying the system as tropical depression one the depression moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream for the following 24xc2xa0hours allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on mayxc2xa029 the system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on mayxc2xa030 about 345xc2xa0mi (555xc2xa0km) south-southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm front{4]as a tropical cyclone the depression had no impact on land however the precursor to the system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of the north carolina coastline but no damage{4] upon becoming a tropical depression on mayxc2xa028 tropical depression one became the northernmost forming may tropical cyclone in atlantic history though subtropical cyclones formed equally far north in 1972 and 2007 it also marked the third consecutive year with pre-season tropical or subtropical cyclones in the basin{4]{21]tropical storm ana{edit]tropical

following day the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward on augustxc2xa014 the depression regenerated roughly 1075xc2xa0mi (1735xc2xa0km) east of the leeward islands early on augustxc2xa015 the storm re-attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh) and a barometric pressure of 1003xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2965xc2xa0inhg) the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post-storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on augustxc2xa016 before reaching any landmasses{22]numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the dominican republic between augustxc2xa015 and 17{22] several islands took minor precautions for the storm including st croix which evacuated 40xc2xa0residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm{23] in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters{24] impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall{22] in puerto rico up to 276xc2xa0in (70xc2xa0mm){25] causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools high winds associated with the storm also downed trees and power lines leaving roughly 6000

the cape verde islands and the lesser antilles eventually the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a categoryxc2xa04 storm roughly 345xc2xa0mi (555xc2xa0km) east-northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of 130xc2xa0mph (215xc2xa0kmh) the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly 175xc2xa0mi (280xc2xa0km) west of bermuda as a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of nova scotia the following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low on augustxc2xa024{6]two people were killed by the storm's large swellsxe2x80x94one in maine and another in florida the hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on augustxc2xa016{6] large life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted north-facing coastlines of puerto rico and hispaniola as hurricane bill approached bermuda{27] along the coasts of north carolina waves averaging 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) in height impacted beaches on long island beach damage was severe; in some areas the damage was worse than hurricane gloria in 1985{28] in new york severe beach erosion caused by the storm resulted in over 355xc2xa0million in losses{29]tropical storm

claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of tallahassee florida by the afternoon the storm had attained winds of 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) and steadily tracked towards the florida panhandle early on augustxc2xa017 the center of claudette made landfall on santa rosa island several hours after landfall the storm weakened to a tropical depression and the hydrometeorological prediction center took over primary responsibility of the storm the system quickly dissipated and was last noted over alabama on augustxc2xa018{30]the national hurricane center issued tropical storm warnings for the florida coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas{30]{31] tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between augustxc2xa016 and 18 two people were killed offshore amidst rough seas from the storm{32] an ef-0 tornado spawned by the storm in cape coral damaged 11 homes leaving 103000 in damages additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to 125000 as a result of claudette{33]tropical storm danny{edit]tropical

wind shear and high sea surface temperatures receiving the name fred on septemberxc2xa08 the storm quickly developed an eye feature and was upgraded to a hurricane roughly 24xc2xa0hours after being named within a 12xe2x80x91hour span the storm's winds increased by 40xc2xa0mph (65xc2xa0kmh) to its peak of 120xc2xa0mph (195xc2xa0kmh) upon reaching this intensity fred became the strongest storm on record south of 30xc2xb0n and east of 35xc2xb0w in the atlantic basin not long after the intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within the system by septemberxc2xa011 the storm nearly stalled northwest of the cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm the following day fred degenerated into a remnant low before taking a westward track across the atlantic the remnants of fred persisted for nearly a week nearly regenerating into a tropical depression several times the low eventually dissipated on septemberxc2xa019 to the south of bermuda{15]tropical

cyclone on octoberxc2xa04 this smaller low developed into a tropical storm while situated near the azores islands becoming the northeastern-most forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record the storm quickly turned northeastward and intensified developing an eye-like feature as it attained peak winds of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum pressure of 986xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2911xc2xa0inhg) it weakened over increasingly colder waters and began merging with an approaching frontal boundary early on octoberxc2xa06 grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating later that day near wales{16]although grace passed through the azores islands the storm had little known effects there{16] in europe the system and its remnants brought rain to several countries including

wind shear the storm briefly re-attained hurricane status for a third time near the southeastern louisiana coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until novemberxc2xa011 at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful nor'easter causing significant damage in the mid-atlantic states the resulting storm came to be known as nor'ida{5]in the southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly 21xc2xa0million in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40000 people homeless{46]{47] ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to 125xc2xa0in (320xc2xa0mm) of rain during the storm's passage{5] in the united states the hurricane and the subsequent nor'easter caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states{5] one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to the nor'easter overall the two systems caused nearly 300xc2xa0million in damage throughout the country{33]storm names{edit]the following names were used for named storms in the north atlantic in 2009 names that were not used are marked in gray
