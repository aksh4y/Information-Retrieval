damage estimates in dollars however were not released{2] despite the large size{6] and great intensity of the hurricane ample warnings prevented loss of life and commerce at sea{7]bahamas{edit]as the storm passed north of cat island it caused a pressure of 2947xc2xa0inhg (9980xc2xa0mb) and a wind of 20xc2xa0mph (32xc2xa0kmh) from the north{8] although the cyclone passed within 65xc2xa0mi (105xc2xa0km) of the bahamian capital nassau the storm only caused winds up to 50xc2xa0mph (80xc2xa0kmh) and no significant damage there{9]the storm was very destructive on abaco island where the reported barometric pressure was below 2750xc2xa0inhg (9313xc2xa0mb) at hope town strong winds shifting from northeast to southeast destroyed 83 homes and severely damaged 63 food supplies ran low and salt contaminated the drinking supply all public buildings along with the radio station were destroyed the lowest pressure at hope town was 2720xc2xa0inhg (9211xc2xa0mb) around 15 utc on september 5 at nearby marsh harbour northeast winds shifted to southwest at 20 utc and calm conditions occurred for 15 minutes as the eye passed the barometer dropped as low as 2760xc2xa0inhg (9346xc2xa0mb) 12 homes were destroyed and most of the remainder severely damaged on green turtle cay near abaco island north and northwest winds coincided with the worst conditions; a large storm surge inundated the island all buildings and the graveyard were destroyed and at least six people died with 25 injuries reported at nearby coopers town just six homes survived the storm only four homes were still standing on great guana cay{10] on green turtle cay two large brick churches with stone walls 3xc2xa0ft (091xc2xa0m) thick were destroyed by the storm and winds were estimated by one resident to have exceeded 200xc2xa0mph (320xc2xa0kmh); some of the stone blocks from the churches were reportedly carried 050xc2xa0mi (080xc2xa0km) newspaper reports and photos helped to establish estimated prevailing winds on green turtle cay that possibly exceeded 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) during the hurricane{2]after the storm passed abaco on september 6 and 7 several vessels caught in the storm recorded winds of force 12 (beaufort wind scale) and low barometric pressures; the steamship yankee arrow recorded a pressure of 2765xc2xa0inhg (9363xc2xa0mb) on september 7 while the nearby steamship deer lodge reported a lower pressure of 2758xc2xa0inhg (9340xc2xa0mb){2]united states{edit]although storm warnings were posted for the florida and eastern united states coastline the storm's recurvature prevented a landfall leaving the main effects as heavy coastal swells and high winds gale-force winds affected the coastline however{6] as the cyclone passed closest to new england nantucket recorded the highest winds at 56xc2xa0mph (90xc2xa0kmh) as the storm remained offshore although it still contained hurricane-force winds{2] winds peaked at 44xc2xa0mph (71xc2xa0kmh) at cape hatteras strong gales on the evening of september 7 caused the cape lookout lightship to be blown loose from her anchorage off the coast at the same time the crew of the munson steamer munloyal then believed to be 350xc2xa0mi (560xc2xa0km) southeast of frying pan shoals north carolina reported that her position was unknown and her rudder blown away united states coast guard cutters from fort lauderdale florida were dispatched to her assistance{11] large trees and signs fell down in brooklyn new york due to high winds cold temperatures followed in the wake of the hurricane{12]newfoundland iceland and jan mayen island{edit]although the storm was extratropical by the time it bypassed newfoundland and was near iceland and jan mayen island it was still intense: observed barometric pressures were at or below 29xc2xa0inhg (9821xc2xa0mb){2]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portal1899 san ciriaco hurricanehurricane joaquinlist of atlantic hurricane seasonslist of category 5 atlantic hurricanesreferences{edit]^ neely wayne (2006) the major hurricanes to affect the bahamas authorhouse pxc2xa0268 isbnxc2xa0978-1425966089xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i mitchell charles l (september 1932) "the tropical storm of august 30-september 15 1932" (pdf) monthly weather review 60 (9): 177xe2x80x93178 bibcode:1932mwrv60177 doi:1011751520-0493(1932)60<177:ttsoai>20co;2xc2xa0^ a b c d "atlantic hurricane best track (hurdat version 2)" hurricane research division (database) miami fl: national hurricane center april 11 2017 retrieved october 28 2017xc2xa0^ "nassau in path;
