produce winds of at least 75 mph in florida in a single seasonxe2x80x94frances ivan and jeanne it was the third named storm the second hurricane and the second major hurricane of the 2004 atlantic hurricane season charley lasted from august 9 to august 15 and at its peak intensity it attained 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) winds making it a strong categoryxc2xa04 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale it made landfall in southwestern florida at maximum strength making it the strongest hurricane to hit the united states since hurricane andrew struck florida in 1992after moving slowly through the caribbean sea charley crossed cuba on friday august 13 as a category 3 hurricane causing heavy damage and four deaths that same day it crossed over the dry tortugas just 22xc2xa0hours after tropical storm bonnie had struck northwestern florida it was the first time in history that two tropical cyclones struck the same state in a 24-hour period{1] at its peak intensity of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) hurricane charley struck the northern tip of captiva island and the southern tip of north captiva island before crossing over bokeelia causing severe damage{2] charley the strongest hurricane to hit southwest florida since hurricane donna in 1960 then continued to produce severe damage as it made landfall on the peninsula in punta gorda it continued to the north-northeast along the peace river corridor devastating punta gorda port charlotte cleveland fort ogden nocatee arcadia zolfo springs sebring and wauchula zolfo springs was isolated for nearly two days as masses of large trees power poles power lines transformers and debris filled the streets wauchula sustained gusts to 147xc2xa0mph (237xc2xa0kmh); buildings in the downtown areas caved onto main street ultimately the storm passed through the central and eastern parts of the orlando metropolitan area still carrying winds gusting up to 106xc2xa0mph (171xc2xa0kmh) the city of winter park north of orlando also sustained considerable damage since its many old large oak trees had not experienced high winds falling trees tore down power utilities and smashed cars and their huge roots lifted underground water and sewer utilities the storm slowed as it exited the state over ormond beach just north of daytona beach the storm was ultimately absorbed by a front in the atlantic ocean shortly after sunrise on august 15 near southeastern massachusetts{3]{4]damage in the state totaled to over 13xc2xa0billion (2004 usd) charley initially was expected to hit further north in tampa and caught many floridians off-guard due to a sudden change in the storm's track as it approached the state throughout the united states charley caused 10xc2xa0deaths and 154xc2xa0billion in damage to insured residential property making it the second costliest hurricane in united states history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth){5] charley was a compact fast-moving storm which limited the

linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalecharley began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of africa on august 4{3] it moved quickly westward and steadily organized over the open atlantic ocean with convection developing in curved bands{3] the wave continued to develop as it approached the lesser antilles and became tropical depression three on august 9 while 115xc2xa0mi (185xc2xa0km) south-southeast of barbados near the island of grenada however the threat to barbados was short-lived{3]{6] low upper-level wind shear and well-defined outflow contributed to further intensification and the depression strengthened on august 10 despite being located in the eastern caribbean sea which is an area not particularly suited to tropical cyclogenesis{4] at this time the national hurricane center in miami designated the name "charley"{3]hurricane charley approaching cuba on august 12a strong ridge of high pressure to the system's north forced charley to change track quickly to the west-northwest it continued to strengthen and became a category 1 hurricane on august 11 while 90xc2xa0mi (140xc2xa0km) south of kingston jamaica{3]{6] the storm was being steered around the periphery of the high pressure area and as a result charley changed direction toward the northwest the following day the core passed 40xc2xa0mi (64xc2xa0km) southwest of jamaica affecting the island on august 11 and 12{4]{6] the storm then passed 15xc2xa0mi (24xc2xa0km) northeast of grand cayman reaching categoryxc2xa02 status just after passing the island{3]{4] the hurricane continued to strengthen as it turned to the northwest and rounded the southwest portion of the subtropical ridge becoming a major hurricanexe2x80x94a storm classified as a category 3 hurricane or higherxe2x80x94just before making landfall on southern cuba{3] charley came ashore near punta cayamas with maximum sustained winds of 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) and gusts of up to 133xc2xa0mph (214xc2xa0kmh) at about 0430 utc on august 13{6] it weakened while crossing the island passing about 15xc2xa0mi (24xc2xa0km) west of downtown havana before weakening to 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh){3]after crossing cuba near menelao mora hurricane charley accelerated to the north-northeast toward the southwest coast of florida in response to the approach of an unseasonal mid-tropospheric trough{6] charley passed over the dry tortugas at 1200 utc on august 13 with maximum winds of about 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh){3]{4] the strike occurred only 22xc2xa0hours after tropical storm bonnie made landfall on st vincent island marking the first time two tropical cyclones hit the same state within a 24-hour period{1] then charley rapidly intensified strengthening from a 110xc2xa0mph (180xc2xa0kmh) hurricane with a minimum central barometric pressure of 965xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2850xc2xa0inhg) to a 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) hurricane with a pressure of 947xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2796xc2xa0inhg) in just threexc2xa0hours it continued to strengthen as it turned more to the northeast and made landfall near the island of cayo costa florida as a 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh) category 4 hurricane with a pressure of 941xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2779xc2xa0inhg) at approximately 1945 utc on august 13{4]{7] an hour later the hurricane struck punta gorda as a 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) storm and then passed up through port charlotte{3] however the eye had shrunk before landfall limiting the most powerful winds to an area within 7xc2xa0mi (11xc2xa0km) of the center{3]charley weakened considerably due to its passage over land but still retained sustained winds of about 85xc2xa0mph (137xc2xa0kmh) as it passed directly over orlando between 0020 and 0140 utc august 14xc2xa0; gusts of up to 106xc2xa0mph (171xc2xa0kmh) were recorded at orlando international airport{4] it cut a swath of destruction across florida also passing near kissimmee{3] the hurricane reemerged into the atlantic ocean after crossing directly over new smyrna beach as a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane but restrengthened slightly over open waters{3]{4] continuing to move rapidly to the north-northeast charley struck near cape romain national wildlife refuge south carolina as an 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) hurricane moved offshore briefly and made its final landfall near north myrtle beach as a minimal hurricane with winds of 75xc2xa0mph (121xc2xa0kmh){4] charley then began interacting with an approaching frontal boundary becoming a tropical storm over southeastern north carolina{4] after moving back into the atlantic ocean near virginia beach on august 15 the storm became extratropical and became embedded in the frontal zone{3]{4] the extratropical storm continued to move rapidly to the northeast and was completely absorbed by the front shortly after sunrise on august 15 near southeastern massachusetts{3]{4]preparations{edit]nexrad image of hurricane charley over punta gorda florida just after landfallon august 10 two days before the hurricane passed near the island jamaican officials issued a tropical storm warning which was upgraded to a hurricane warning a day later{3] in jamaica the threat of the storm forced the country's two airports to close and also forced two cruise ships to reroute{8] the cayman islands issued a hurricane warning on august 11 a day before the hurricane passed near the archipelago{3]cuban government officials issued a hurricane watch for the southern coastline on august 11 two days before the hurricane struck the island this was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th 13 xc2xbd hours before charley made landfall{3] because of the threat the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235000xc2xa0citizens and 159000xc2xa0animals in the area of the expected impact{9] an additional 3800xc2xa0residents were evacuated from offshore islands while 47000 in havana were transported from old unsafe buildings to safer areas{10] the people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies in addition the power grid in southern cuba was turned off to avoid accidents{9]on august 11 florida governor jeb bush issued a state of emergency declaration due to the impending threat charley presented to the state while the storm was still located south of jamaica{11] the national hurricane center issued hurricane warnings for the florida keys and from cape sable to the mouth of the suwannee river a day prior to charley's passage through the state while tropical storm warnings were issued elsewhere throughout florida{3] because of the threat 19xc2xa0million people along the florida west coast were urged to evacuate including 380000xc2xa0residents in the tampa bay area and 11000 in the florida keys{12]{13]{14] it was the largest evacuation order for pinellas county history{14] and the largest evacuation request in florida since hurricane floyd five years before many floridians remained despite the evacuation order as authorities estimated that up to a million people would not go to shelters;{15] instead these residents boarded up their homes and bought supplies to ride out the storm{13] however about 142xc2xa0million people evacuated their homes in florida and approximately 50000xc2xa0residents were placed in shelters throughout the state{16]{17] power companies mobilized workers to prepare for the expected widespread power outages macdill air force base home of us central command (uscentcom) and the us military center for the iraq war severely limited its staff on base shifting most of its operations to its forward headquarters in doha qatar{13] similarly kennedy space center which usually counts with 13000xc2xa0on-site personnel reduced its staff to only 200xc2xa0people in preparation for the hurricane and secured all space shuttles by sealing them in their hangars many amusement parks in the orlando area closed early and walt disney world's animal kingdom remained closed this was only the second time in history that a disney park was closed due to a hurricane with the other occurrence being after hurricane floyd{18] the approaching hurricane also forced several cruise ships to reroute their paths{13] and forced rail service between miami and new york to shut down{19]charley making landfall on august 13 2004the rapid strengthening of charley in the eastern gulf of mexico caught many by surprise around five hours before its florida landfall charley was a strong categoryxc2xa02 hurricane predicted to strengthen its strongest winds to 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh) upon its landfall in the tampa-saint petersburg area{20] about two hours before landfall the national hurricane center issued a special advisory notifying the public that charley had become a 145xc2xa0mph (233xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa04 hurricane with a predicted landfall location in the port charlotte area{21] as a result of this change in forecast numerous people in the charlotte county area were unprepared for the hurricane despite the fact that the new track prediction was well within the previous forecast's margin of error national hurricane center forecasting intern robbie berg publicly blamed the media for misleading residents into believing that a tampa landfall was inevitable in addition he also stated that residents of port charlotte had ample warning{22] as a hurricane warning had been issued for the landfall area 23xc2xa0hours before and a hurricane watch had existed for 35xc2xa0hours{3]several local meteorologists however did depart from the official predictions of a tampa bay landfall as early as the morning of august 13 jim farrell{23] of wink robert van winkle wbbh steve jerve of wfla in tampa jim reif of wzvn in fort myers and tom terry of wftv in orlando all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 utc that charley was going to turn early striking around charlotte harbor and traveling over orlando as would prove to be the case{24]following the florida landfall georgia governor sonny perdue declared a state of emergency as a precaution against a 4xe2x80x937xc2xa0ft (12xe2x80x9321xc2xa0m) storm surge and price gouging{25] in south carolina governor mark sanford declared a state of emergency as charley approached its final landfall two coastal counties were forced to evacuate with state troopers redirecting traffic further inland from myrtle beach{18] in all 138000 evacuated from the grand strand area{26]impact{edit]storm deaths by region{3]regiondirectindirecttotaljamaica101cuba404florida92029rhode island101total152035one death in jamaica four deaths in cuba and ten deaths in the united states were directly attributed to charley{3] numerous injuries were reported as well as 25 indirect deaths in the us{3]property damage from charley in the united states was estimated by the nhc to be 150xc2xa0billion{27] at the time this figure made charley the second costliest hurricane in united states history behind 1992's hurricane andrew's 437xc2xa0billion however charley has since dropped to ninth costliest due to the damage caused by hurricane ivan later in the 2004 atlantic hurricane season hurricane katrina and hurricane wilma in 2005 hurricane ike in 2008 hurricane irene in 2011 hurricane sandy in 2012 and hurricane harvey in 2017{28]caribbean sea{edit]see also: effects of hurricane charley in jamaicapowerline in cuba damaged by hurricane charleyon jamaica strong winds caused moderate damage to the agricultural sector with crop and livestock damage totaling to 144xc2xa0million{29] as the storm traveled along the southwest coast of jamaica it caused heavy wind and rain damage{6] damage was heaviest in saint elizabeth parish where 100xc2xa0people had to be housed in six shelters strong winds downed trees and power lines causing power outages and blocking roads{30] throughout the country charley caused 41xc2xa0million in damage and one fatality{6] in spite of the close approach that charley made on the cayman islands the islands were mostly spared and were subjected to little damage{30] rainfall was light peaking at 09 inches (23xc2xa0mm) in grand cayman while cayman brac reported tropical storm force winds{3]costliest us atlantic hurricanescost refers

national hurricane center{31]{32]{33]{nb 1]operationally forecasters estimated that charley struck southern cuba as a 105xc2xa0mph (169xc2xa0kmh) categoryxc2xa02 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale{34] in post-hurricane-season analysis charley was determined to have struck southern cuba as a 120xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) hurricane; the original estimate was revised based on a report of a 118xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) sustained wind measurement in playa baracoa and meant that charley was a major hurricane at landfall{6] the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 131xc2xa0ft (40xc2xa0m) in playa cajio;{3] on the other hand charley's quick passage caused precipitation amounts to be small with the largest total 587 inches (149xc2xa0mm) occurring in mariel{6]strong wind gusts downed nearly 1500xc2xa0power lines and knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at a power plant in mariel as a result more than half of the electricity customers in havana province were left without power for 12xc2xa0days after the storm and all of pinar del rxc3xado province was without power for over 11xc2xa0days blackouts continued in areas where power returned the power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people including no potable water in the city of havana for four days as a result the cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need similarly there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week however one cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages{10]near its landfall location charley destroyed 290 of the 300xc2xa0houses in the village while over 70000xc2xa0homes in havana were either damaged or destroyed numerous hotels reported damage potentially impacting the important tourism industry in the country agricultural damage was heavy with the hurricane damaging more than 3000 agricultural institutions citrus officials estimated a loss of 15000xc2xa0metric tons of grapefruit on the isle of youth while strong winds ruined 66000xc2xa0metric tons of citrus trees in the havana area charley also destroyed around 57000xc2xa0acres (230xc2xa0kmxc2xb2) of fruit trees in the havana area{10] approximately 95 of the sugar cane bean and banana crops were affected in cuban territory{35] in all charley was directly responsible for four deaths in cuba and was responsible for 923xc2xa0million in property damage primarily from agricultural losses{6]florida{edit]hurricane charley severely affected the state of florida there were nine direct fatalities 20xc2xa0indirect fatalities and numerous injuries attributed to the storm{3] property damage was estimated at 54xc2xa0billion and approximately 285xc2xa0million in agricultural damage{17] however due to charley's speed (it crossed the florida peninsula in approximately seven hours) and small size rainfall along the eyewall was mostly limited to 4xe2x80x936 inches (10xe2x80x9315 centimetres){17]while moving northward to the west of the florida keys charley produced moderate winds of 48xc2xa0mph (77xc2xa0kmh) with gusts to 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) in key west{3] the winds toppled a few trees power lines and unreinforced signs a boat knocked loose by strong waves struck a power transmission line causing widespread power outages from marathon to key west on fort jefferson in the dry tortugas the hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to 6xc2xa0ft (18xc2xa0m) the surge combined with incoming waves caused extensive flooding in the park and damaged numerous docks in spite of this property damage was minimal in the area totaling 160000{12]damage in captiva islandhurricane charley passed directly over captiva island near cayo costa with peak winds of 150xc2xa0mph (240xc2xa0kmh){3] the categoryxc2xa04xc2xa0hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to 65xc2xa0ft (20xc2xa0m) on the island which is lower than expected for a storm of its intensity the decrease in the height of the surge was due to the hurricane's small size and its rapid intensification just prior to landfall furthermore the storm surge combined with the strong pressure gradient produced a xc2xbcxc2xa0mi (450xc2xa0m) inlet on north captiva island{36] known as charley's cut strong waves and storm surge caused severe beach erosion and dune damage at various locations the storm severely damaged five houses lightly damaged many others and downed many trees on gasparilla island at least half of the 300xc2xa0homes on north captiva island were substantially damaged including ten that were destroyed on captiva island the strong winds severely damaged most houses as well as several recreational buildings{37]the city of arcadia in desoto county saw extreme damage in spite of being relatively further inland{38] about 95 of the buildings in the downtown area saw some sort of damage the only shelter in the town had its roof torn open by the wind leaving 3500 evacuees inside unprotected from the onslaught of the storm{39]damage caused to a gas station by hurricane charley in kissimmee floridahardee county saw property damage estimated at 750xc2xa0million along with six injuries but no deaths were reported charley caused blackouts in the entire county as well as damage toxc2xa03600xc2xa0homes and the destruction ofxc2xa01400 a radio tower near sebring was toppled along with numerous trees and power poles along the north and east side of highlands county additionally there were several reports of severely damaged homes in polk county near babson park and avon park in lake wales florida a sand mine lake encroached into state road 60 due to wave action and swallowed a car additionally lake wales saw 23000xc2xa0buildings damaged as well as the destruction of 739xc2xa0structures seven deaths were reported in the county one of them determined to be direct{40]throughout the rest of the islands in sarasota charlotte lee and collier counties strong winds from hurricane charley caused severe damage to hundreds of buildings and trees{37] lee county also endured an 8-foot (24xc2xa0m) storm surge{17] these counties were exposed to charley's eyewall so they saw the most damage due to its small size the area of most intense damage was located within a 10-mi (16-km) band centered on charley's track with additional heavy damage forming an outer band extending 75xc2xa0mi (121xc2xa0km) to each side of the inner swath of damage{41] in charlotte county 80 of buildings were damaged{42]president george w bush aboard marine one surveys hurricane damage at a mobile home park in fort myers floridaon mainland florida charley produced a peak storm surge of 10xe2x80x9313 feet (30xe2x80x9340 metres) at vanderbilt beach near naples along with a much lower surge at its punta gorda landfall{36] the hurricane dropped generally light rainfall across florida with the maximum amount of 988 inches (251xc2xa0mm) occurring in bud slough in sarasota county{4] in punta gorda's airport where the hurricane made landfall wind speeds of up to 90xc2xa0mph (140xc2xa0kmh) were measured alongside gusts of up to 111xc2xa0mph (179xc2xa0kmh) before the instrument was blown apart along with most of the planes and the airport itself{3]{41] the charlotte regional medical center recorded an unofficial peak wind gust of 172xc2xa0mph (277xc2xa0kmh){3] port charlotte's saint joseph's hospital had its roof blown away by charley's strong winds{41] due to the compact nature of the hurricane the storm's radius of maximum sustained winds only extended a short distance from its center in comparison fort myers which is only 25xc2xa0mi (40xc2xa0km) from where charley made landfall experienced sustained winds of only 61xc2xa0mph (98xc2xa0kmh) with gusts of 78xc2xa0mph (126xc2xa0kmh){3] in south florida charley spawned several tornadoes including a long-lived f2 that struck clewiston{43] and five weak tornadoes near the point where the hurricane made landfall{44]aerial image of destroyed homes in punta gordathe most severe damage from hurricane charley occurred in charlotte county in boca grande numerous houses sustained extensive roof damage while thousands of trees and power lines were uprooted or snapped in port charlotte and punta gorda many buildings rvs and mobile homes were completely destroyed while other buildings were uproofed due to the powerful winds{44]charley devastated southwest florida causing 146xc2xa0billion in property damage on the peninsula of florida alone many towns such as punta gorda and port charlotte were leveled by the hurricane trees were downed and trailer parks were obliterated as far as ormond beach{45]charley also caused considerable damage in the central and eastern parts of the state several possible tornadoes occurred with severe thunderstorms during the duration of the storm winds were estimated to be at 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) sustained near and to the north of okeechobee while winds at orlando international airport topped out at 105xc2xa0mph (169xc2xa0kmh) in a gust{46] the storm caused 2xc2xa0million customers to lose electricity in florida{41] in some areas power was not restored for weeks: 136000 residents had no electricity a week after charley's landfall{47] and 22000xc2xa0customers primarily from cooperatives were still waiting for their service to be restored on august 26{48] citizens in daytona beach new smyrna beach and port orange in southeastern volusia county also dealt with storm surge from the st johns river and halifax river and intracoastal waterway as charley passed over before re-emerging into the atlantic ocean further inland seminole county experienced some of the highest winds ever recorded from a hurricane in the area with a gust of 97xc2xa0mph (156xc2xa0kmh) in longwood at 0407 utc on august 14 and 101xc2xa0mph (163xc2xa0kmh) in altamonte springs power was out in these areas for up to 12 days after the storm in some locationsempty railroad hopper cars toppled over as a result of high winds from hurricane charley in fort meadepublic schools in some counties in the path of the hurricane were scheduled to be closed for two weeks{49] in some areas this was necessary because the school buildings were damaged or destroyed: all 59xc2xa0of osceola county's schools were damaged and one-third of charlotte county's were destroyed by charley's impact desoto county schools saw 6xc2xa0million in damage while orange county public schools saw 9xc2xa0million in damage to their educational infrastructure{50]agricultural losses were heavy in florida the second-largest producer of oranges in the world damage to the citrus crop was estimated at 200xc2xa0million and caused a 50 increase in the price of grapefruit juice charley along with the other storms that hit florida during 2004 caused a total agricultural loss of 22xc2xa0billion other crops nurseries buildings and agricultural equipment also suffered{51]rest of united states{edit]main articles: effects of hurricane charley in north carolina and effects of hurricane charley in south carolinahurricane charley just after its

wind gusts were moderate peaking at 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) in north myrtle beach though there were several unofficial records of hurricane-force gusts{3] charley produced moderate rainfall along its path peaking at over 7xc2xa0in (178xc2xa0mm){4] moderate winds knocked down numerous trees{52] flash flooding occurred in charleston county causing drainage problems{53] damage in south carolina

produced minor beach erosion along the coastline winds gusted from 60 to 70xc2xa0mph (97 to 113xc2xa0kmh) causing minor wind damage rainfall amounts in the state were moderate ranging from 4 to 6xc2xa0in (100 to 150xc2xa0mm) but still caused flooding across seven north carolina counties the hurricane spawned five weak tornadoes across the state{54] including an f1 in nags head that damaged twenty structures{55] charley destroyed 40xc2xa0houses and damaged 2231 231 severely including 221 damaged beach homes in sunset beach damage was the greatest in brunswick county where wind gusts peaked at 85xc2xa0mph (137xc2xa0kmh) crop damage was also heavy in brunswick county with 50 of the tobacco crop lost and 30 of the corn and vegetable fields destroyed strong winds downed trees and
