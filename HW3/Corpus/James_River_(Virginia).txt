mountains near iron gate on the border between alleghany and botetourt counties from the confluence of the cowpasture and jackson rivers and flows into the chesapeake bay at hampton roads tidal waters extend west to richmond the capital of virginia at the river's fall line (the head of navigation) larger tributaries draining to the tidal portion include the appomattox river chickahominy river warwick river pagan river and the nansemond riverat its mouth near newport news point the elizabeth river and the nansemond river join the james river to form the harbor area known as hampton roads between the tip of the virginia peninsula near old point comfort and the willoughby spit area of norfolk in south hampton roads a channel leads from hampton roads into the southern portion of the chesapeake bay and out to the atlantic ocean a few miles further east many boats pass through this river to import and export virginia productshistory{edit]the native americans who populated the area east of the fall line in the late 16th and early 17th centuries called the james river the powhatan river named for the chief of the powhatan confederacy which extended over most of the tidewater region of virginia the english colonists named it "james" after king james i of england{4] as they also constructed the first permanent english settlement in the americas in 1607 at jamestown along the banks of the james river about 35 miles (56xc2xa0km) upstream from the chesapeake baythe navigable portion of the river was the major highway of the colony of virginia during its first 15 years facilitating supply ships delivering supplies and more people from england however for the first five years despite many hopes of gold and riches these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors in 1612 businessman john rolfe successfully cultivated a non-native strain of tobacco which proved popular in england soon the river became the primary means of exporting the large hogsheads of this cash crop from an ever-growing number of plantations with wharfs along its banks this development made the proprietary efforts of the virginia company of london successful financially spurring even more development investments and immigration below the falls at richmond many james river plantations had their own wharfs and additional ports andor early railheads were located at warwick bermuda hundred city point claremont scotland and smithfield and during the 17th century the capital of the colony at jamestownnavigation of the james river played an important role in early virginia commerce and the settlement of the interior although growth of the colony was primarily in the tidewater region during the first 75 years the upper reaches of the river above the head of navigation at the fall line were explored by fur trading parties sent by abraham wood during the late 17th centuryalthough ocean-going ships were unable to navigate beyond present-day richmond portage of products and navigation with smaller craft to transport crops other than tobacco was feasible produce from the piedmont and great valley regions traveled down the river to seaports at richmond and manchester through such port towns as lynchburg scottsville columbia and buchananjames river and kanawha canal{edit]the james river was considered as a route for transport of produce from the ohio valley the james river and kanawha canal was built for this purpose to provide a navigable portion of the kanawha river a tributary of the ohio river for the most mountainous section between the two points the james river and kanawha turnpike was built to provide a portage link via wagons and stagecoaches however before the canal could be fully completed in the mid-19th century railroads emerged as a more practical technology and eclipsed canals for economical transportation the chesapeake and ohio railway (co) was completed between richmond and the ohio river at the new city of huntington west virginia by 1873 dooming the canal's economic prospects in the 1880s the richmond and alleghany railroad was laid along the eastern portion of the canal's towpath and became part of the co within 10 years in modern times this rail line is used primarily in transporting west virginia coal to export coal piers at newport newsrecreation{edit]james river at huntington park beach in newport newsthe james river contains numerous parks and other recreational attractions canoeing fishing kayaking hiking and swimming are some of the activities that people enjoy along the river during the summer from the river's start in the blue ridge mountains to richmond numerous rapids and pools offer fishing and whitewater rafting the most intense whitewater stretch is a 2-mile (3xc2xa0km) segment that ends in downtown richmond where the river goes over the fall line this is the only place in the country where extensive class iii (class iv with above average river levels) whitewater conditions exist within sight of skyscrapers the urban river parks provide a great outdoor recreationadventure opportunity for all the people of richmond and the surrounding communities{citation needed] below the fall line east of richmond the river is better suited for water skiing and other large boat recreation here the river is known for its blue catfish reaching average sizes of 20 to 30 pounds (91 to 136xc2xa0kg) with frequent catches exceeding 50 pounds (23xc2xa0kg) in the chesapeake watershed the james river is the last confirmed holdout for the nearly extirpated atlantic sturgeon in may 2007 a survey identified 175 sturgeon remaining in the entire river with 15 specimens exceeding 5 feet (15xc2xa0m){5]dams{edit]due to its potential for generating mechanical power for rotating machinery such as grist mills hydroelectric power and as a water route for trade many dams have been built across the james river since the time of european settlement of the region while most of these dams have been removed or failed several dams still exist along the upper course of the river from the head of the river downstream to richmond are found the following dams as identified by the current us army corps of engineers national inventory of dams:{6]the cushaw hydroelectric project near glasgow and big islandthe bedford hydropower project near big islandthe big island dam near big islandthe coleman falls dam in coleman fallsthe holcomb rock dam near lynchburgthe reusens dam near lynchburgthe scotts mill dam in lynchburgthe bosher dam in richmondthe tallest dam is the reusens dam which also has the greatest hydroelectric nameplate capacity and the greatest reservoir capacity at 1617 feet the longest dam is the cushaw hydroelectric project due to the highly angled path the dam takes across the riverwhile not identified in the national inventory of dams a very low head weir structure is found below bosher dam in richmond on either side of williams island known as the "z-dam" for its zigzag course on the south side of the island the current structure was built in 1932 and serves to direct water into richmond's water treatment facility on the north bank the less than 5 feet tall dam does not serve any power or navigation purpose{7]{8]bridges{edit]acl railroad crossing at the falls in richmondamtrak's northeast regional crosses near lynchburgboulevard bridge in richmondmain
