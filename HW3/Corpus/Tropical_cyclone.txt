center a closed low-level atmospheric circulation strong winds and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain depending on its location and strength a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names including hurricane (xcbx88hxcax8crxc9xaakxc9x99n -kexc9xaan){1]{2]{3] typhoon (taxc9xaaxcbx88fuxcbx90n) tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression and simply cyclone{4] a

counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and blowing clockwise in the southern hemisphere the opposite direction of circulation is due to the coriolis effect tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water they derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation this energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms such as nor'easters and european windstorms which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2000xc2xa0km (62 and 1243xc2xa0mi) in diameterthe strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation as a result they rarely form within 5xc2xb0 of the equator{6] tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from earthxe2x80x99s southwestern quartersphere mainly because the shapes of the african and south american continents permit the benguela and humboldt currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5xcbx9an with excessively cool water these powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the south atlantic and southeast pacific which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the brazil current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres also the african easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea along with the asian monsoon and western pacific warm pool are feature of the northern hemisphere and australiacoastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical cyclone compared to inland regions the primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water and weaken quite rapidly over land coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain high waves (due to winds) storm surges (due to severe pressure changes) and the potential of spawning tornadoes tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large areaxe2x80x94which can be a vast area for the most severe cyclonesxe2x80x94and concentrate the precipitation of the water content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into a much smaller area this continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres (25xc2xa0mi) from the coastline far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one timethough their effects on human populations are often devastating tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions

pressure in the troposphere with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface on earth the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level{7] the environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes thus they are characterized as xe2x80x9cwarm corexe2x80x9d systems{8]wind fieldthe near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a center of circulation while also flowing radially inwards at the outer edge of the storm air may be nearly calm; however due to the earthxe2x80x99s rotation the air has non-zero absolute angular momentum as air flows radially inward it begins to rotate cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere) in order to conserve angular momentum at an inner radius air begins to ascend to the top of the troposphere this radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the eyewall and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently it is known as the radius of maximum winds{9] once aloft air flows away from the storm's center producing a shield of cirrus clouds{10]the previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly axisymmetric: wind speeds are low at the center increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii however the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes such as thunderstorm activity and horizontal flow instabilities in the vertical direction winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere{11]eye and centerplay medianasa animation of hurricane arthur in 2014 showing rain rates and internal structure from gpm satellite dataat the center of a mature tropical cyclone air sinks rather than rises for a sufficiently strong storm air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation thereby creating a clear xe2x80x9ceyexe2x80x9d weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds although the sea may be extremely violent{12] the eye is normally circular in shape and is typically 30xe2x80x9365xc2xa0km (19xe2x80x9340xc2xa0mi) in diameter though eyes as small as 3xc2xa0km (19xc2xa0mi) and as large as 370xc2xa0km (230xc2xa0mi) have been observed{13]{14]the cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the xe2x80x9ceyewallxe2x80x9d the eyewall typically expands outward with height resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect{14] the eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found air rises most rapidly clouds reach to their highest altitude and precipitation is the heaviest the heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land{12]in a weaker storm the eye may be obscured by the central dense overcast which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone{15]the eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall replacement cycles particularly in intense tropical cyclones outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum when the primary eyewall weakens the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily the outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle at which time the storm may return to its original intensity{16]rapid deepeningtyphoon nabi as seen from the international space station on september 3 2005main article: rapid deepeningon occasion tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period{17] in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely high (near or above 30xc2xa0xc2xb0c 86xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface wind shear must be low; when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as wellxe2x80x94for extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently{18]sizesize descriptions of tropical cyclonesrocitypeless than

large{19]there are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size the most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind the radius of 34-knot wind (ie gale force) the radius of outermost closed isobar (roci) and the radius of vanishing wind{20]{21] an additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1xc3x9710xe2x88x925 sxe2x88x921{14]on earth tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes from 100xe2x80x932000 kilometres (62xe2x80x931243xc2xa0mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind they are largest on average in the northwest pacific ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern pacific ocean basin{22] if the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222xc2xa0km (138xc2xa0mi)) then the cyclone is "very small" or a "midget" a radius of 3xe2x80x936 latitude degrees (333xe2x80x93670xc2xa0km (207xe2x80x93416xc2xa0mi)) is considered "average sized" "very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8xc2xa0degrees (888xc2xa0km (552xc2xa0mi)){19] observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (ie maximum wind speed) radius of maximum wind latitude and maximum potential intensity{21]{22]size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm all else equal a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time additionally a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch longer duration and enhanced wave setup{23]the upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere which at low latitudes is 15000xe2x80x9318000 metres (50000xe2x80x9360000xc2xa0ft){24]physics and energeticstropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low levels near the surface rises in thunderstorm clouds and outflows at high levels near the tropopause{25]the three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a "primary circulation" and a "secondary circulation" the primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular the secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the radial and vertical directions the primary circulation is larger in magnitude dominating the surface wind field and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the energetics of the stormsecondary circulation: a carnot heat enginea tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation the energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric carnot heat engine{26] first inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (ie latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation the ocean cools and the air warms) second the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation) third air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause finally air subsides and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content the first and third legs are nearly isothermal while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic this in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation the carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attainscientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to 200xc2xa0exajoules (1018xc2xa0j) per day{27] equivalent to about 1xc2xa0pw (1015xc2xa0watt) this rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20xc2xa0minutes{27]{28]primary circulation: rotating windsthe primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation of angular momentum by the secondary circulation absolute angular momentum on a rotating planet m{displaystyle m} is given bym=12fr2+vr{displaystyle m={frac {1}{2}}fr^{2}+vr}where f{displaystyle f} is the coriolis parameter v{displaystyle v} is the azimuthal (ie rotating) wind speed and r{displaystyle r} is the radius to the axis of rotation the first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical (ie the axis of rotation) the second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator (where f=0{displaystyle f=0} ) tropical cyclones rarely form within 5xc2xb0 of the equator{6]{29]as air flows radially inward at low levels it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum similarly as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone the result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (ie xe2x80x9cwarm-corexe2x80x9d) from hydrostatic balance the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface{11]maximum potential intensitydue to surface friction the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum thus the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and sink (friction) of energy for the system this fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day) there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the wind-induced surface heat exchange (wishe) feedback{26] this feedback is offset when frictional dissipation which increases with the cube of the wind speed becomes sufficiently large this upper bound is called the xe2x80x9cmaximum potential intensityxe2x80x9d vp{displaystyle v_{p}} and is given byvp2=ckcdtsxe2x88x92totoxcex94k{displaystyle v_{p}^{2}={frac

delta k} is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ({jkg]) and ck{displaystyle c_{k}} and cd{displaystyle c_{d}} are the surface exchange coefficients (dimensionless) of

saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and k{displaystyle k} is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surfacethe maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone (ie without a tropical cyclone) and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity and how these regions may evolve in time{31]{32] specifically the maximum potential intensity has three components but its variability in space and time is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air enthalpy difference component xcex94k{displaystyle delta k}derivationa tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface

corresponding to a carnot efficiency of xcfxb5=13{displaystyle epsilon =13} the ratio of the surface exchange coefficients ckcd{displaystyle c_{k}c_{d}} is typically taken to be 1 however observations suggest that the drag coefficient cd{displaystyle c_{d}} varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane{34] additionally ck{displaystyle c_{k}} may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer{35]a characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity vp{displaystyle v_{p}} is 80 metres per second (180xc2xa0mph; 290xc2xa0kmh) however this quantity varies significantly across space and time particularly within the seasonal cycle spanning a range of 0 to 100 metres per second (0 to 224xc2xa0mph; 0 to 360xc2xa0kmh){33] this variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( xcex94k{displaystyle delta k} ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate these processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics) background near-surface wind speed and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating{36] the nature of this modulation is complex particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer) on shorter time-scales variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water{37] however this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on vp{displaystyle v_{p}} is weak in comparisoninteraction with the upper oceanchart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the gulf of mexico as hurricanes katrina and rita passed overthe passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially which can influence subsequent cyclone development this cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters this effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes) cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage all these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days{38]major basins and related warning centersmain articles: tropical cyclone basins and regional specialized meteorological centertropical

of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood{55] while six factors appear to be generally necessary tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the following conditions in most situations water temperatures of at least 265xc2xa0xc2xb0c (797xc2xa0xc2xb0f) are needed down to a depth of at least 50xc2xa0m (160xc2xa0ft);{56] waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms{57] for tropical transitioning cyclones (ie hurricane ophelia (2017)) a water temperature of at least 225xc2xa0xc2xb0c (725xc2xa0xc2xb0f) has been suggested{58]another factor is rapid cooling with height which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone{56] high humidity is needed especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop{56] low amounts of wind shear are needed as high shear is disruptive to the storm's circulation{56] tropical cyclones generally need to form more than 555xc2xa0km (345xc2xa0mi) or five degrees of latitude away from the equator allowing the coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation{56] lastly a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously{56] low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the madden-julian oscillation can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances{59]locationsmost tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near the equator referred to as the intertropical front (itf) the intertropical convergence zone (itcz) or the monsoon trough{60]{61]{62] another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves which contribute to the development of about 85 of intense tropical cyclones in the atlantic ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the eastern pacific{63]{64]{65] the majority forms between 10 and 30xc2xa0degrees of latitude away of the equator{66] and 87 forms no farther away than 20xc2xa0degrees north or south{67]{68] because the coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5xc2xa0degrees of the equator where the effect is weakest{67] however it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as tropical storm vamei and cyclone agni did in 2001 and 2004 respectively{69]{70]movementthe movement of a tropical cyclone (ie its "track") is typically approximated as the sum of two terms: "steering" by the background environmental wind and "beta drift"{71]environmental steeringenvironmental steering is the dominant term conceptually it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions similar to "leaves carried along by a stream"{72] physically the winds or flow field in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place in this way tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow this environmental flow is termed the "steering flow"climatologically tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical ridgexe2x80x94a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans{72] in the tropical north atlantic and northeast pacific oceans the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the african coast toward the caribbean sea north america and ultimately into the central pacific ocean before the waves dampen out{64] these waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region{63] in contrast in the indian ocean and western pacific in both hemispheres tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone and the monsoon trough{73] additionally tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems such as extratropical cyclonesbeta driftin addition to environmental steering a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward a motion known as "beta drift" this motion is due to the superposition of a vortex such as a tropical cyclone onto an environment in which the coriolis force varies with latitude such as on a sphere or beta plane it is induced indirectly by the storm itself the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environmentphysically the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center because air must conserve its angular momentum this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center the combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward this effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flowmultiple storm interactionmain article: fujiwhara effecta third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones when two cyclones approach one another their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems depending on their separation distance and strength the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge when the two vortices are of unequal size the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction and the smaller vortex will orbit around it this phenomenon is called the fujiwhara effect after sakuhei fujiwhara{74]interaction with the mid-latitude westerliessee also: westerliesstorm track of typhoon ioke showing recurvature off the japanese coast in 2006though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone this motion termed "recurvature" commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common{75] an example of tropical cyclone recurvature was typhoon ioke in 2006{76]landfallsee also: tropical cyclogenesis xc2xa7xc2xa0unusual areas of formationthe landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves over a coastline{9] storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land yet not make landfall noaa uses the term "direct hit" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within the radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side) whether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall{9]dissipationfactorstropical storm franklin an example of a strongly sheared tropical cyclone in the north atlantic hurricane basin during 2005a tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways one such way is if it moves over land thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself quickly losing strength{77] most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two or evolve into extratropical cyclones there is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water such as with hurricane ivan if it remains over mountains for even a short time weakening will accelerate{78] many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall{79] this rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides as was the case with hurricane mitch around honduras in october 1998{80] without warm surface water the storm cannot survive{81]a tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below 265xc2xa0xc2xb0c (797xc2xa0xc2xb0f) this will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center and become a remnant low-pressure area these remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity this dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern north pacific{82] weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone{83] in addition its interaction with the main belt of the westerlies by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones this transition can take 1xe2x80x933xc2xa0days{84] even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated it can still have tropical storm force (or occasionally hurricanetyphoon force) winds and drop several inches of rainfall in the pacific ocean and atlantic ocean such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of north america these phenomena can also affect europe where they are known as european windstorms; hurricane iris's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995{85] a cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure becoming a larger area of low pressure this can strengthen the resultant system although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone{83] studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones{86]artificial dissipationin the 1960s and 1970s the united states government attempted to weaken hurricanes through project stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide it was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds{87] the winds of hurricane debbiexe2x80x94a hurricane seeded in project stormfuryxe2x80x94dropped as much as 31 but debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays{88] in an earlier episode in 1947 disaster struck when a hurricane east of jacksonville florida promptly changed its course after being seeded and smashed into savannah georgia{89] because there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10 chance of making landfall within 48xc2xa0hours greatly reducing the number of possible test storms the project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts today it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low{90]other approaches have been suggested over time including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans{91] other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation{92] dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop){91] or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons{93] project cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone{94] these approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical{95]effectsthe aftermath of hurricane katrina in gulfport mississippimain article: effects of tropical cyclonestropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves heavy rain flood and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks{96] tropical cyclones stir up water leaving a cool wake behind them which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones{38] on land strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths{97] the broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone and vertical wind shear at its periphery spawns tornadoes tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall{98]over the past two centuries tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 19xc2xa0million people worldwide large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation{97] tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure leading to power outages bridge destruction and the hampering of reconstruction efforts{97]{99] on average the gulf and east coasts of the united states suffer approximately us 5 billion (1995 us ) in cyclone damage every year the majority (83) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes category 3 or greater however category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year{100]although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions{101] tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions{102] and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling{103] the storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment greatly increasing local property values{104]when hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to withstand some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it because of this some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt{105] in addition hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall the flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over the toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area as well as the environment around them the flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills{106]observation and forecastingobservationmain article: tropical cyclone observationsunset view of hurricane isidore's rainbands photographed at 7000 feet (2100xc2xa0m)"hurricane hunter" - wp-3d orion is used to go into the eye of a hurricane for data collection and measurements purposesintense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon and weather stations being relatively sparse are rarely available on the site of the storm itself in general surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area or if there is a nearby ship real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated for this reason there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall{107]tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals as a storm approaches land it can be observed by land-based doppler weather radar radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes{108]in situ measurements in real-time can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone in the atlantic basin these flights are regularly flown by united states government hurricane hunters{109] the aircraft used are wc-130 hercules and wp-3d orions both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft these aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements the aircraft also launch gps dropsondes inside the cyclone these sondes measure temperature humidity pressure and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface a new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted aerosonde a small drone aircraft was flown through tropical storm ophelia as it passed virginia's eastern shore during the 2005 hurricane season a similar mission was also completed successfully in the western pacific ocean this demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare{110]a general decrease in error trends in tropical cyclone path prediction is evident since the 1970sforecastingsee also: tropical cyclone track forecasting tropical cyclone prediction model and tropical cyclone rainfall forecastingbecause of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system the deep layer mean flow or average wind through the depth of the troposphere is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed if storms are significantly sheared use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude such as at the 70xc2xa0kpa pressure surface (3000 metres or 9800 feet above sea level) will produce better predictions tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory{111] high-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones as well as with a wealth of data from earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades{112] however scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones{113] the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development new tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the southern hemisphere and at least every six hours in the northern hemisphere from regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers{44]{114]{115]{116]{117]classifications

cyclones are classified into three main groups based on intensity: tropical depressions tropical storms and a third group of more intense storms whose name depends on the region for example if a tropical storm in the northwestern pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the beaufort scale it is referred to as a typhoon; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the northeast pacific basin or in the north atlantic it is called a hurricane{9] neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is used in either the southern hemisphere or the indian ocean in these basins storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclonesas indicated in the table below each basin uses a separate system of terminology which can make comparisons between different basins difficult in the pacific ocean hurricanes from the central north pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the northwest pacific becoming typhoons (such as hurricanetyphoon ioke in 2006); on rare occasions the reverse will occur{118] it should also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (ms) over 150 miles per hour (240xc2xa0kmh) are called super typhoons by the joint typhoon warning center{119]tropical depression"tropical depression" redirects here for the filipino reggae band see tropical depression (band) for the ep by elephant micah see tropical depression (ep)a tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined surface circulation with maximum sustained winds of less than 34xc2xa0kn (39xc2xa0mph; 63xc2xa0kmh){43] within the southern hemisphere the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants but not near the centre{43]tropical storm"tropical storm" redirects here for the album see tropical storm (album) a tropical storm is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 34 knots (63xc2xa0kmh) and 64 knots (119xc2xa0kmh) at this point the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop although an eye is not usually present government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term named storm){120] although tropical storms are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage the shear force of winds can blow off shingles and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines roofing and siding more dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding{121]hurricane or typhoonmain articles: atlantic hurricane pacific hurricane and typhoona hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least 34xc2xa0ms (66xc2xa0kn; 76xc2xa0mph; 120xc2xa0kmh){120] a cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation the eye is often visible in satellite images as a small circular cloud-free spot surrounding the eye is the eyewall an area about 16 kilometres (99xc2xa0mi) to 80 kilometres (50xc2xa0mi) wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm's center maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about 95xc2xa0ms

cyclone naming and history of tropical cyclone namingthe practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming{127]{128] the system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form that is readily understood and recognized by the public{127]{128] the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907{127]{128] this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific{127]{128] formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north and south atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian ocean{128]at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings{127] since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described{127] names are assigned in order from predetermined lists with one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65xc2xa0kmh (40xc2xa0mph) depending on which basin it originates{39]{41]{42] however standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the southern hemisphere{42]{43] the names of significant tropical cyclones in the north atlantic ocean

hour (310xc2xa0kmh){144] the highest maximum sustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots (95xc2xa0ms) or 215 miles per hour (345xc2xa0kmh) in hurricane patricia in 2015 which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the western hemisphere{145] typhoon nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots (95xc2xa0ms) or 215 miles per hour (346xc2xa0kmh) but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record{122] likewise a surface-level gust caused by typhoon paka on guam in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots (105xc2xa0ms) or 235 miles per hour (378xc2xa0kmh) had it been confirmed it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the earth's surface but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm{146] the world meteorological organization established barrow island as the location of the highest non-tornado related wind gust at 408xc2xa0kmh (253xc2xa0mph){147] the gust occurred on 10 april 1996 during severe tropical cyclone olivia and is documented in the australian meteorological and oceanographic journal{148] in addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure tip was the largest cyclone on record with tropical storm-force winds 2170 kilometres (1350xc2xa0mi) in diameter the smallest storm on record tropical storm marco formed during october 2008 and made landfall in veracruz marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23xc2xa0mi) in diameter{149]hurricane john is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record lasting 31xc2xa0days in 1994 before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961 however many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations{150] john is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the northern hemisphere on record which had a path of 8250xc2xa0mi (13280xc2xa0km){151] cyclone rewa of the 1993xe2x80x9394 south pacific and australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the southern hemisphere traveling a distance of over 5545xc2xa0mi (8920xc2xa0km) during december 1993 and january 1994{151]changes caused by el nixc3xb1oxe2x80x93southern oscillationsee also: el nixc3xb1oxe2x80x93southern oscillationmost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies{152] when the subtropical ridge position shifts due to el nixc3xb1o so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience much fewer septemberxe2x80x93november tropical cyclone impacts during el nixc3xb1o and neutral years during el nixc3xb1o years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130xc2xb0e which would favor the japanese archipelago{153] during el nixc3xb1o years guam's chance of a tropical cyclone impact is one-third more likely than of the long-term average{154] the tropical atlantic ocean experiences depressed activity due to increased vertical wind shear across the region during el nixc3xb1o years{155] during la nixc3xb1a years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and much greater intensity in the philippines{153]long-term activity trendssee also: atlantic hurricane reanalysisatlantic multidecadal cycle since 1950 using accumulated cyclone energy (ace)atlantic multidecadal oscillation timeseries 1856xe2x80x932013while the number of storms in the atlantic has increased since 1995 there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87xc2xa0xc2xb1xc2xa010 (between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually) however the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins primarily in the southern hemisphere{156] while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near australia (based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the el nixc3xb1o-southern oscillation){157] in spite of that there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing kerry emanuel stated "records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes the energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70 in the past 30xc2xa0years or so corresponding to about a 15 increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60 increase in storm lifetime"{158]atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten most expensive storms in united states history have occurred since 1990 according to the world meteorological organization "recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions"{159] political scientist pielke et al (2008) normalized mainland us hurricane damage from 1900xe2x80x932005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage the 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades the decade 1996xe2x80x932005 was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades with only the decade 1926xe2x80x931935 surpassing its costsoften in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect{160]the number and strength of atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50xe2x80x9370xc2xa0year cycle also known as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation nyberg et al reconstructed atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3xe2x80x935 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40xe2x80x9360xc2xa0years and six other averaging 15xe2x80x9325 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10xe2x80x9320xc2xa0years these periods are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation throughout a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancingdampening the number of major hurricanes by 1xe2x80x932 per year{161]although more common since 1995 few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970xe2x80x9394{162] destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960 including many major new england hurricanes twenty-one atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933 a record only recently exceeded in 2005 which saw 28 storms tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900xe2x80x9325; however many intense storms formed during 1870xe2x80x9399 during the 1887 season 19 tropical storms formed of which a record 4 occurred after november 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however many struck in the early 19th century including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on new york city some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as category 4 in strength{163]these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm hit land in a populated area{160]proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the gulf of mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia{164]{165] few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 3000xe2x80x931400 bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3xe2x80x935 times this millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the azores high{165] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the north atlantic oscillation{166]according to the azores high hypothesis an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the gulf of mexico coast and the atlantic coast during the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in haiti around 3200 14c years bp{167] and a change towards more humid conditions in the great plains during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the mississippi valley through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500xe2x80x931000xc2xa0years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millenniumclimate changemain article: tropical cyclones and climate changethe 2007 ipcc report noted many observed changes in the climate including atmospheric composition global average temperatures ocean conditions and others the report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict in addition the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity{168]pj webster and others published in 2005 an article in science examining the "changes in tropical cyclone number duration and intensity" over the past 35xc2xa0years the period when satellite data has been available their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north atlantic ocean there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones{169]according to 2006 studies by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"{170]studies published since 2008 by kerry emanuel from mit indicate that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity{171] in an article in nature kerry emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness a measure combining hurricane strength duration and frequency "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature reflecting well-documented climate signals including multidecadal oscillations in the north atlantic and north pacific and global warming" emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century"{172]research reported in the september 3 2008 issue of nature found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger in particular over the north atlantic and indian oceans wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of 225xc2xa0kmh (140xc2xa0mph) in 1981 to 251xc2xa0kmh (156xc2xa0mph) in 2006 while the ocean temperature averaged globally over all the regions where tropical cyclones form increased from 282xc2xa0xc2xb0c (828xc2xa0xc2xb0f) to 285xc2xa0xc2xb0c (833xc2xa0xc2xb0f) during this period{173]{174]a 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods storm surge and terrestrial flooding (rivers) and projects an increase due to global warming{175]{176]related cyclone typesgustav on september 9 2002 the first system to be given a name as a subtropical cyclonesee also: cyclone extratropical cyclone and subtropical cyclonein addition to tropical cyclones there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types these kinds of cyclones known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation{177] an extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences which are typical in higher latitudes a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as frequently an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone{178] from space extratropical storms have a characteristic "comma-shaped" cloud pattern{179] extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas{180]a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone they can form in a wide band of latitudes from the equator to 50xc2xb0 although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm{181] from an operational standpoint a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition{182]popular culturemain article: tropical cyclones in popular culturein popular culture tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media including films books television music and electronic games{183] these media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events{183] for example george rippey stewart's storm a best-seller published in 1941 is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to pacific tropical cyclones{128] another example is the hurricane in the perfect storm which describes the sinking of the andrea gail by the 1991 perfect storm{184] hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as the simpsons invasion family guy seinfeld dawson's creek burn notice and csi: miami{183]{185]{186]{187]{188]{189] the 2004 film the day after tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical "hurricane-like" albeit non-tropical arctic storms{190]{191]see alsotropical cyclones portalatlantic hurricane seasonaustralian region tropical cyclone seasoncyclonedisaster
