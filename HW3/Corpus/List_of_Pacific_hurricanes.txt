means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impactscharacteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane season's timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as rainfall

pacific began in the 1960 season that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific; that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year{33] that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year{34]named storms per month{edit]four of the july cyclones during the 2016 seasonbefore 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the

the pacific ocean east of the dateline for more than two weeks continuously hurricanes john and dora spent some time in the west pacific before dissipating john spent eleven days west of the dateline; if that time was included john would have existed for a total of 30xc2xa0days and 18xc2xa0hours a world record while including dora's time in the west pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days{35] one atlantic hurricane hurricane joan crossed into this basin and was renamed miriam{45] giving it a total lifespan of 22xc2xa0days{46] but not all of that was in the pacific 1993's greg

all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity{35]no known tropical cyclone forming in the central north pacific lasted for longer than 14xc2xa0days without crossing into another basin{35] the tropical cyclone forming in the central pacific that spent the most time there was 2014's hurricane ana at 1275xc2xa0days from formation to extratropical transition{47]{48]rankduration

extratropical before doing so{35]{73] in addition an unofficial cyclone formed on october 30 2006 in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an eye-like structure{85] its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude 149xc2xb0w and dissipated at 135xc2xb0w{86] nasa which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91c{85] the system has also been called extratropical{87] this cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either regional specialized meteorological center{88]{89]intensity records{edit]ten most intense{edit]hurricane patricia the most intense pacific
