north atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies 1856-2013the atlantic multidecadal oscillation (amo) is a climate cycle that affects the sea surface temperature (sst) of the north atlantic ocean based on different modes on multidecadal timescales{1] while there is some support for this mode in models and in historical observations controversy exists with regard to its amplitude and in particular the attribution of sea surface temperature change to natural or anthropogenic causes especially in tropical atlantic areas important for hurricane development{2] the atlantic multidecadal oscillation is also connected with shifts in hurricane activity rainfall patterns and intensity and changes in fish populations{3]contents1 definition11 amo index2 mechanisms3 climate impacts worldwide4 relation to atlantic hurricanes5 periodicity and prediction of amo shifts6 references7 further reading8 external linksdefinition{edit]the atlantic multidecadal oscillation (amo) was identified by schlesinger and ramankutty in 1994{4]the amo signal is usually defined from the patterns of sst variability in the north atlantic once any linear trend has been removed this detrending is intended to remove the influence of greenhouse gas-induced global warming from the analysis however if the global warming signal is significantly non-linear in time (ie not just a smooth linear increase) variations in the forced signal will leak into the amo definition consequently correlations with the amo index may mask effects of global warming{5]amo index{edit]several methods have been proposed to remove the global trend and el nixc3xb1o-southern oscillation (enso) influence over the north atlantic sst trenberth and shea assuming that the effect of global forcing over the north atlantic is similar to the global ocean subtracted the global (60xc2xb0n-60xc2xb0s) mean sst from the north atlantic sst to derive a revised amo index{6]ting et al however argue that the forced sst pattern is not globally uniform; they separated the forced and internally generated variability using signal to noise maximizing eof analysis{2]van oldenborgh et al derived an amo index as the sst averaged over the extra-tropical north atlantic (to remove the influence of enso that is greater at tropical latitude) minus the regression on global mean temperature{7]guan and nigam removed the non stationary global trend and pacific natural variability before applying an eof analysis to the residual north atlantic sst{8]the linearly detrended index suggests that the north atlantic sst anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is equally divided between the externally forced component and internally generated variability and that the current peak is similar to middle twentieth century; by contrast the others methodology suggest that a large portion of the north atlantic anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is externally forced{2]frajka-williams et al 2017 pointed out that recent changes in cooling of the subpolar gyre warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics increased the spatial distribution of meridional gradient in sea surface temperatures which is not captured by the amo index{3]mechanisms{edit]see also: atlantic meridional overturning circulation and ocean heat contentbased on the about 150-year instrumental record a quasi-periodicity of about 70 years with a few distinct warmer phases between ca 1930xe2x80x931965 and after 1995 and cool between 1900xe2x80x931930 and 1965xe2x80x931995 has been identified{9] in models amo-like variability is associated with small changes in the north atlantic branch of the thermohaline circulation{10] however historical oceanic observations are not sufficient to associate the derived amo index to present-day circulation anomalies{citation needed] models and observations indicate that changes in atmospheric circulation which induce changes in clouds atmospheric dust and surface heat flux are largely responsible for the tropical portion of the amo{11]{12]the atlantic multidecadal oscillation (amo) is important for how external forcings are linked with north atlantic ssts{13]climate impacts worldwide{edit]the amo is correlated to air temperatures and rainfall over much of the northern hemisphere in particular in the summer climate in north america and europe{14]{15] through changes in atmospheric circulation the amo can also modulate spring snowfall over the alps {16] and glaciers' mass variability{17] rainfall patterns are affected in north eastern brazilian and african sahel it is also associated with changes in the frequency of north american droughts and is reflected in the frequency of severe atlantic hurricane activity{6]recent research suggests that the amo is related to the past occurrence of major droughts in the us midwest and the southwest when the amo is in its warm phase these droughts tend to be more frequent or prolonged two of the most severe droughts of the 20th century occurred during the positive amo between 1925 and 1965: the dust bowl of the 1930s and the 1950s drought florida and the pacific northwest tend to be the oppositexe2x80x94warm amo more rainfall{18]{citation needed]climate models suggest that a warm phase of the amo strengthens the summer rainfall over india and sahel and the north atlantic tropical cyclone activity{19] paleoclimatologic studies have confirmed this patternxe2x80x94increased rainfall in amo warmphase decreased in cold phasexe2x80x94for the sahel over the past 3000 years{20]relation to atlantic hurricanes{edit]see also: tropical cyclones and climate changenorth atlantic tropical cyclone activity according to the accumulated cyclone energy index 1950xe2x80x932015 for a global ace graph visit this linka 2008 study correlated the atlantic multidecadal mode (amm) with hurdat data (1851xe2x80x932007) and noted a positive linear trend for minor hurricanes (category 1 and 2) but removed when the authors adjusted their model for undercounted storms and stated "if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming it is currently obscured by the 60 year quasi-periodic cycle"{21] with full consideration of meteorological science the number of tropical storms that can mature into severe hurricanes is much greater during warm phases of the amo than during cool phases at least twice as many; the amo is reflected in the frequency of severe atlantic hurricanes{18]{unreliable source] based on the typical duration of negative and positive phases of the amo the current warm regime is expected to persist at least until 2015 and possibly as late as 2035 enfield et al assume a peak around 2020{22]since 1995 there have been nine atlantic hurricane seasons considered "extremely active" by accumulated cyclone energy - 1995 1996 1998 1999 2003 2004 2005 2010 and 2017{citation needed]periodicity and prediction of amo shifts{edit]there are only about 130xe2x80x93150 years of data based on instrument data which are too few samples for conventional statistical approaches with the aid of multi-century proxy reconstruction a longer period of 424 years was used by enfield and cidxe2x80x93serrano as an illustration of an approach as described in their paper called "the probabilistic projection of climate risk"{23] their histogram of zero crossing intervals from a set of five re-sampled and smoothed version of gray et al (2004) index together with the maximum likelihood estimate gamma distribution fit to the histogram showed that the largest frequency of regime interval was around 10xe2x80x9320 year the cumulative probability for all intervals 20 years or less was about 70there is no demonstrated predictability for when the amo will switch in any deterministic sense computer models such as those that predict el nixc3xb1o are far from being able to do this enfield and colleagues have calculated the probability that a change in the amo will occur within a given future time frame assuming that historical variability persists probabilistic projections of this kind may prove to be useful for long-term planning in climate sensitive applications such as water managementassuming that the amo continues with a quasi-cycle of roughly 70 years the peak of the current warm phase would be expected in c 2020{24] or based on a 50xe2x80x9390 year quasi-cycle between 2000 and 2040 (after peaks in c 1880 and c 1950){22]{relevant? xe2x80x93 discuss]a 2017 study predicts a continued cooling shift beginning 2014 and the authors note "unlike the last cold period in the atlantic the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the atlantic is not uniformly cool but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the subpolar gyre warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics the tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in ssts which are not represented by the amo index value but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess"{3]references{edit]^ gerard d mccarthy; ivan d haigh; joxc3xabl jm hirschi; jeremy p grist  david a smeed (27 may 2015) "ocean impact on decadal atlantic climate variability revealed by
