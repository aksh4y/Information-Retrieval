islands bahamas florida eastern united states eastern canada greenland western europepart of the 2007 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane noel was the fourteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season noel formed on october 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the north-central caribbean it strengthened to winds of 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) before making landfall on western haiti and the north coast of eastern cuba it turned northward and on november 1 it attained hurricane status the hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the bahamas and on november 2 it became an extratropical cyclone (the canadian hurricane centre classified noel as a post-tropical storm until 2200 utc november 4 when it determined that it had lost all tropical characteristics)the storm caused at least 163 direct deaths along its path primarily in hispaniola due to flooding and mudslides it was the deadliest north atlantic hurricane of the 2007 season after its transition to post-tropical noel became a very strong low pressure system causing flooding and wind damage over maine and eastern canada with heavy rainfall occurring across atlantic canada and snowfall over some areas of eastern quebec and labrador noel's remnants subsequently combined with cyclone tilo a powerful european windstorm which later struck western europe and contibuted to the north sea flood of 2007 on the night of 8xe2x80x939 novembercontents1 meteorological history2 preparations21 caribbean and bahamas22 united states and canada3

external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave exited the coast of africa on october 16 it tracked westward initially without organization and by october 22 was interacting with a trough while approaching the lesser antilles this caused a low pressure area to develop on octoberxc2xa023 about 175xc2xa0mi (282xc2xa0km) east-northeast of the northern lesser antilles the system continued westward with disorganized convection and was unable to develop further due to strong wind shear{1] despite the shear convection increased as barometric pressures dropped in association with the organizing system{2] turning west-southwestward the low passed over the united states virgin islands on octoberxc2xa025 and just southeast of puerto rico the next day decreasing wind shear on octoberxc2xa027 allowed the thunderstorms to increase over the center late on octoberxc2xa027 after further organization the system developed into tropical depression sixteen at 0000xc2xa0utc on octoberxc2xa028 about 215xc2xa0mi (346xc2xa0km) south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti{1] initially the national hurricane center (nhc) forecast the depression to track west-northwestward brushing southwestern haiti before moving ashore along south-central cuba{3]upon becoming a tropical cyclone the wave was moving to the west-northwest under the steering currents of a high pressure area over the western atlantic ocean{3] six hours after formation the center became difficult to locate{4] though subsequently the depression became much better organized; a large area of convection developed over the center with several rainbands to its south{5] based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm noel at 1815xc2xa0utc on october 28 while located about 150 miles (240xc2xa0km) south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti{6] after the center re-developed beneath the thunderstorms the storm quickly strengthened to winds of 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh){7] and for several hours the cyclone was drifting to the south of hispaniola noel began to lose organization as a nearby upper-level low increased wind shear{8] with the circulation becoming ill-defined as it further interacted with the mountainous terrain of haiti{9] the storm crossed western haiti as a disorganized tropical storm on october 29{10] and subsequently began moving parallel to the northeastern coast of cuba while moving around the southwestern periphery of a weakening ridge{11] on october 30 tropical storm noel made landfall near gibara cuba with winds of about 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh){12]{13]the center of noel remained well-organized as it tracked through eastern cuba though its sustained winds quickly diminished to minimal tropical storm force{14] early on october 31 it began drifting to the north-northwest in response to the approach of a short-wave trough from the west and the eastward shift of the mid-level ridge{15] a large area of strong convective rainbands persisted to its east though due to increased upper-level wind shear there was little convection near the center{16] shortly after 1200xc2xa0utc on october 31 noel emerged off the north coast of cuba{17] and subsequently the cyclone became better organized as the circulation became better associated with the convection{18] while located just off the north coast of cuba the motion of noel was nearly stationary though forecasters indicated it could have executed a small cyclonic loop{19] on october 31 the canadian hurricane centre began tracking the storm{20]hurricane noel undergoing extratropical transition on november 2convection increased early on november 1 though initially the center remained to the southwest of the large area of thunderstorms{21] at 1800xc2xa0utc that day the storm passed over the bahamian island of new providence near the city of nassau{22] later that day the center tracked beneath the convection{23] and noel accelerated northeastward in the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching trough; as it did so the center became elongated and distorted{24] the cyclone maintained a large round area of deep convection with well-defined outflow and an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded noel to hurricane status early on november 2 about 180 miles (290xc2xa0km) north-northeast of nassau bahamas{25] its convection began to wane as it moved through progressively cooler waters and as it lost tropical characteristics its wind field expanded{26] by late on november 2 the inner core had substantially diminished and the thermodynamical structure of the cyclone had become asymmetrical and frontal; as it began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the national hurricane center issued the final advisory on hurricane noel{27]early on november 3 the extratropical cyclone attained winds of 85xc2xa0mph (137xc2xa0kmh) and it gradually turned to the north-northeast{28] as the center of noel approached nova scotia its large circulation produced strong winds across all of atlantic canada and new england{29] and on november 4 it tracked across nova scotia and new brunswick{30] at 6 pm ast (2200 utc) november 4 as the storm was over labrador the canadian hurricane center declared that noel has lost all tropical characteristics and changed its designation from post-tropical to extratropical {31] the extratropical low continued to the northeast and made landfall over southwest greenland on the afternoon of november 5 bringing tropical storm force winds to the area the center dissipated over greenland later that night while its lowest barometric pressure as a tropical system was 980 mb on november 4 while located near labrador it registered a minimum pressure of 966 mb{32]noel's remnants subsequently turned east and crossed the atlantic ocean combining with powerful european windstorm cyclone tilo over the norwegian sea several days laterpreparations{edit]caribbean and bahamas{edit]tropical storm noel nearing hispaniola on october 28the san juan national weather service issued widespread flood and flash flood warnings and watches across puerto rico due to unsettled conditions officials advised residents to stay out of harms way and off the roadways{33] a flash flood warning was issued for the entirety of the united states virgin islands{34]upon being classified as a tropical cyclone the government of haiti issued a tropical storm warning for the southwestern peninsula from its border with the dominican republic westward to port-au-prince{35] by the time noel made landfall on haiti a tropical storm warning was either recommended or put in place for the southern coast of hispaniola from barahona dominican republic to port-au-prince haiti in haiti health care centers were advised to activate any emergency plans and medicine stocks were pre-positioned if needed residents in flood-prone areas were evacuated{36] in the departments of sud-est sud grand'anse nippes ouest centre and artibonie a red alert was issued while an orange alert was issued for nord-est nord and nord-ouest{37] in the dominican republic 14500xc2xa0people sought protection in shelters{38] about 1000 inmates were evacuated from a prison north of the country's capital city{39] the national emergency commission authorized the opening of a number of shelters and the dominican red cross activated search and rescue teams the coordination centre set up a "crisis room" assigning workers to 24-hour shifts{40]a hurricane watch was issued for southeastern cuba; a tropical storm warning was in effect for the southeastern bahamas including the turks and caicos islands and a tropical storm watch was put in place for the central bahamas{41] a tropical storm warning was also issued for the northwestern bahamas{13] there most government offices were closed during the passage of the storm{42] on the island of andros residents took extra care in securing their boats{43] as the storm tracked further to the northwest a tropical storm warning was put in place for the cuban provinces of guantxc3xa1namo holguxc3xadn las tunas ciego de xc3x81vila and camagxc3xbcey{13]{44] the cuban institute of meteorology advised caution to residents due to previous heavy rainfall leaving grounds saturated{45] several schools were closed during the storm's onslaught{46] in camagxc3xbcey thousands of cattle were moved to higher ground and roughly 3000 students working to harvest coffee crops were forced to return home a united states naval base in guantanamo bay stacked sandbags to protect structures in areas vulnerable to flooding namely those in low-lying terrain{47]united states and canada{edit]late on october 31 the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch for southeastern florida as tropical storm force winds were expected to come close to the coastline{19] coastal flood warnings high surf advisories and high wind warnings were posted for the coastline of florida north carolina and south carolina as noel churned offshore in the atlantic similar advisories were placed into effect from virginia beach virginia to ocean city maryland a coastal flood watch was issued for parts of new york including long island{48]{49] as the extratropical storm progressed north wind advisories were posted along the coast of new england{48] and a winter storm watch was issued for northern maine{50] the cape cod and islands division of the red cross opened a number of shelters on nantucket and along coastal massachusetts stores on cape cod were closed; some of them boarded up windows{51] and the us coast guard completed preparations and warned sailors of the storm{52]prior to the arrival of noel into atlantic canada heavy rain and strong wind warnings were put in place for many locations in southeastern canada the canadian hurricane center issued hurricane-force wind warnings for waters to the southwest of the maritimes and gale warnings for waters elsewhere off of southeastern canada the halifax and montreal storm prediction centers of the meteorological service of canada issued high winds and heavy rain warning for all the areas of the maritimes newfoundland labrador and eastern quebec as well as heavy snow warnings for certain regions{28] air canada canceled 13 of their flights in and out of halifax throughout nova scotia 500 red cross volunteers were put on standby{53]impact{edit]deaths by areaareadeathsbahamas1cuba1dominican republic129haiti90jamaica1canada1{54]total223lesser antilles and

unofficially reaching over 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) on saint croix{34] and saint thomas{55]the precursor disturbance also dropped heavy rainfall across puerto rico for several days leaving grounds saturated and causing surface runoff{33] precipitation peaked at 1723 inches (438xc2xa0mm) at carite lake{56] flash flooding was reported in carolina and a mudslide occurred in utuado flooding occurred along several rivers including the rxc3xado de la plata with a reading of 89 feet (27xc2xa0m) above flood stage at toa baja reported late on october 27{33] in response to high water levels officials opened dam gates along the rxc3xado de la plata and the rxc3xado carraxc3xadzo{57] there were no official reports of fatalities{1]dominican republic{edit]in the dominican republic the highest rainfall amount reported was 2165 inches (550xc2xa0mm) at padre las casas{58] people in the path of the flooding escaped to roof and tree tops;{45] more than 50000xc2xa0people left their homes additionally about 1000xc2xa0prisoners were evacuated due to flooding for about two hours the entire island was without power two days later one-third of the population was still without electricity{45] the heavy rainfall caused extreme flooding throughout the island which caused mudslides as well it is reported that buildings were swept down the sides of mountains{42] the flooding damaged over 24500 homes{59] of which 6000 were completely destroyed{1] many rivers topped their banks causing flash flooding in valleys which killed 10 people in the town of piedra blanca{60] many roads and bridges were destroyed isolating some villages from outside civilization;{61] at least 21xc2xa0bridges in the country were washed away or collapsed{62] by just days after the storm 1522

displaced by the storm{83] and 104 were injued{80]jamaica cuba and the bahamas{edit]tropical storm noel over the bahamas on november 1heavy rainfall fell across portions of jamaica; the rains triggered a mudslide that caused a house to collapse killing one person{76] the eastern end of the island was hit particularly hard{84] several communities were isolated and roads and bridges were impassable in some areas{85] the rainfall caused at least 20xc2xa0mudslides across the island;{62] one of them caused a large pile-up that persisted for hours{84]in cuba the storm dropped about 6 inches (150xc2xa0mm) of rainfall in six hours in the city of baracoa which overflowed reservoirs in the region the highest 24xc2xa0hour total noted was at mangos de baraguxc3xa1 where 364xc2xa0mm (143xc2xa0in) fell between the mornings of october 29 and october 30{86] strong winds and rough waves were reported along the northern coastline{76] the storm caused severe flooding and mudslides which damaged over 21000xc2xa0homes in the province of granma alone{46]{87] and destroyed about 120xc2xa0homes in camagxc3xbcey{88] flooding isolated a few areas{42] and destroyed more than 39xc2xa0millionxc2xa0lb (18xc2xa0millionxc2xa0kg) of crops in ciego de xc3x81vila province{44] the rainfall contributed to precipitation totals being 300 of the normal rainfall in guantxc3xa1namo province which caused a dam in the province to overflow{62] in the province of santiago about 400xc2xa0km (250xc2xa0mi) of roads were damaged at least 98000 people throughout the country evacuated from the flooding; of which nearly 20000 did so to escape the cauto river which topped its banks and 40000 were in the province of granma many stayed in shelters of cuba's 239 rivers at least 137 overflowed{89] one fatality was reported in cuba; total damage is estimated at 500xc2xa0million (2007xc2xa0usd){1]tropical storm noel dropped heavy rainfall across portions of the bahamas{76] reaching

flooding was reported especially on abaco island{91] forcing the evacuation of over 700xc2xa0people long island was hit the worst where flood waters reportedly reached 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) deep{92] residents of the island deemed the damage "devastating" reporting that flood waters were the highest in 60 years{93] in some locations houses were under several feet of water while roads throughout

island of exuma abandoned a stalled truck and was subsequently swept away by flood waters into a nearby pond{98] when prime minister hubert ingraham visited hard-hit areas to assess the damage he stated that it would be possible for public works to "be able to get some pumps in to pump some of the water out" however he also noted that "in some areas that will be very difficult because you have ponds on both sides of the road"{95]united states{edit]a surfer in waves from hurricane noel along the florida coasthurricane noel made its closest approach to florida on november 2{99] the interaction of noel and a ridge to its north produced strong gusty winds and high waves along the east coast of the state{15] throughout palm beach broward and miami-dade counties 5000 customers lost power{100] beach erosion was significant amounting to about 4xc2xa0million (2007xc2xa0usd) in damage{101] near west palm beach a 20xc2xa0ft (61xc2xa0m) sand dune was eroded to its foundation{102] in other areas large portions of beach were washed away prompting concerns about properties and structures along the shore{103] rainfall was light with local rainfall amounts up to 214 inches (54xc2xa0mm) as noel's rain bands moved in from the atlantic{104]rainfall summary for noel over florida and new englandas an extratropical cyclone noel interacted with high pressure building in from the northwest forming a tight pressure gradient that produced moderate winds along the outer banks of north carolina primarily on november 2 at cedar island sustained winds of 43xc2xa0mph (69xc2xa0kmh) were reported along the coast from cape lookout northward gusts peaked at around 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh){105] the storm produced strong waves flooding north carolina highway 12 with up to 5xc2xa0ft (15xc2xa0m) of water and sand on november 3{106] about 6000xc2xa0people lost power after winds knocked down a power line eight oceanfront properties were damaged{107] and damage in north carolina totaled 72000 (2007xc2xa0usd){106] as noel was tracking northward parallel to the us east coast high winds affected several states{108] beach erosion was reported in new jersey in some cases eroding a 10xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) vertical drop{109] on long island strong winds knocked down trees and power lines{110]on november 3 the western side of the storm hit eastern new england particularly coastal massachusetts rhode island and maine with hurricane-force wind gusts massachusetts reported the highest wind gust of 89xc2xa0mph (143xc2xa0kmh) with sustained winds topping out at 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) throughout cape cod trees and tree limbs were downed{111] rainfall peaked at 503xc2xa0in (128xc2xa0mm) at cutler rainwise maine while other reports ranged from 2 in (50xc2xa0mm) to 4 in (100xc2xa0mm) across the region{112] in northern maine temperatures were cold enough to support 6xc2xa0in (150xc2xa0mm) of snowfall{113] strong surf caused flooding along the coast with nantucket and martha's vineyard suffering the most;{114] several beachfront houses were severely damaged a few roads were closed mainly due to flooding and downed trees and tree limbs old north wharf in nantucket was damaged beyond repair while numerous small boats were washed ashore{115] power outages were widespread; about 80000 customers in massachusetts mostly on cape cod and 9000 in maine lost electric power{113] despite the effects no fatalities or significant property damage were reported{116]atlantic canada and quebec{edit]rain and snow falls in canadathe storm continued on into atlantic canada with full force in the latter part of november 3 and early on november 4 many flights were cancelled out of several airports and around 150000xc2xa0people in new brunswick and nova scotia lost power for several days due to high winds and "salt fog" disabling the power grid flooding was also reported due to the heavy rainfall{117] in prince edward island 10000xc2xa0people lost electricity newfoundland was relatively unaffected although ferries between it and nova scotia were canceled for the entire weekend and winds peaked at 180xc2xa0kmh (110xc2xa0mph) in wreckhouse{118]{119] over 70xc2xa0mm (28xc2xa0in) of rainfall was received in some areas and waves of over 12 metres (39 feet) were reported in the atlantic off the coast of nova scotia several coastal roads were washed out with boulders thrown far on shore by the pounding surf one fish farm in nova scotia took 1000000 in damage alone losing almost all of its catchin eastern quebec up to 130xc2xa0mm (51xc2xa0in) of rain fell in gaspxc3xa9sie anticosti and eastern cxc3xb4te-nord causing flooding in several areas{120] in the bas-saint-laurent sept-xc3x8eles and baie-comeau regions it was 20xc2xa0cm (8xc2xa0in) of snow that fell causing a bus accident with 10 injuries near saint-simon{120] severe rains flooded the water treatment facility in percxc3xa9 quebec leaving the city under a boil-water advisory;{121] the city was also cut from the rest of the province as the heavy rains made a short section of quebec route 132 unusable in quebec just under 19000 hydro-quxc3xa9bec customers lost power and activity was affected at several cxc3xb4te-nord plants including plants in the aluminum sector{122] a major transmission line in the minganie region was damaged by the heavy wet snow and locally freezing rain causing blackouts and school closures{123] one fatality related to the storm was reported in canada when a boat capsized{54]western europe{edit]cyclone tilo on 8 novemberafter crossing atlantic canada noel's remnants turned east and accelerated across the atlantic ocean before combining with powerful european windstorm cyclone tilo over the norwegian sea several days later subsequently on 8xe2x80x939 november the storm surge from the combined system led to the north sea flood of 2007 leading to flooding in coastal belgium denmark germany the netherlands norway and the united kingdomaftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesthe government of the dominican republic distributed emergency supplies to 145000xc2xa0families following the storm including

and the world bank on november 1{62] storm flooding led to an outbreak of leptospirosis in the dominican republic in the weeks following the passage of noel causing 25xc2xa0deaths and infecting 193xc2xa0others{124] the government of haiti allocated about 15xc2xa0million (usd) for those affected by the storm{45]due to the extensive damage and number of deaths from noel the name was officially retired on may 13 2008 by the world meteorological organization during its annual meeting in orlando florida and will not be used again for any future north atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by
