see properties of water for other uses see water (disambiguation)water in two states: liquid (including the clouds which are examples of aerosols) and solid (ice) a third invisible gaseous state is implied by the presence by the cloudswater is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of earth's streams lakes and oceans and the fluids of most living organisms its chemical formula is h2o meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds strictly speaking water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor) it also occurs in nature as snow glaciers ice packs and icebergs clouds fog dew aquifers and atmospheric humiditywater covers 71 of the earth's surface{1] it is vital for all known forms of life on earth 965 of the planet's crust water is found in seas and oceans 17 in groundwater 17 in glaciers and the ice caps of antarctica and greenland a small fraction in other large water bodies 0001 in the air as vapor clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air) and precipitation{2]{3] only 25 of this water is freshwater and 988 of that water is in ice (excepting ice in clouds) and groundwater less than 03 of all freshwater is in rivers lakes and the atmosphere and an even smaller amount of the earth's freshwater (0003) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products{2] a greater quantity of water is found in the earth's interior{4]water on earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration (evapotranspiration) condensation precipitation and runoff usually reaching the sea evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated mineralssafe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 25 billion lack access to adequate sanitation{5] however some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability{6] a report issued in november 2009 suggests that by 2030 in some developing regions of the world water demand will exceed supply by 50{7]water plays an important role in the world economy approximately 70 of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture{8] fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas rivers lakes and canals large quantities of water ice and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes and in cooking and washing water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment such as swimming pleasure boating boat racing surfing sport fishing and divingcontents1 etymology2

articles: properties of water water (data page) and water modelwater (h2o) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid nearly colorless with a hint of blue this simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the "universal solvent" for its ability to dissolve many substances{10]{11] this allows it to be the "solvent of life"{12] it is the only common substance to exist as a solid liquid and gas in normal terrestrial conditions{13]statessnowflakes by wilson bentley 1902liquid water showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the dropswater is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life specifically at a standard pressure of 1 atm water is a liquid between 0 xc2xb0c (32 xc2xb0f) and 100xc2xa0xc2xb0c (212xc2xa0xc2xb0f) increasing the pressure slightly lowers the melting point which is about xe2x88x925xc2xa0xc2xb0c at 600 atm and xe2x88x9222xc2xa0xc2xb0c at 2100 atm this effect is relevant for example to ice skating to the buried lakes of antarctica and to the movement of glaciers (at pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures)increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the boiling point that is about 374xc2xa0xc2xb0c at 220 atm this effect is important in among other things deep-sea hydrothermal vents and geysers pressure cooking and steam engine design at the top of mount everest where the atmospheric pressure is about 034 atm water boils at 68xc2xa0xc2xb0c (154xc2xa0xc2xb0f)at very low pressures (below about 0006 atm) water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimationxe2x80x94a phenomenon exploited in the freeze drying of food at very high pressures (above 221 atm) the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable a state called supercritical steamwater also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes the maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1xc2xa0atm) is 1000xc2xa0kgm3 (6243xc2xa0lbcuxc2xa0ft); that occurs at 398xc2xa0xc2xb0c (3916xc2xa0xc2xb0f){14] the density of ice is 917xc2xa0kgm3 (5725xc2xa0lbcuxc2xa0ft){15]{16] thus water expands 9 in volume as it freezes which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid waterthe details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that water's unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states{14]{17]{18]{19]taste and odorpure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths{20] and frogs are known to be able to smell it{21] however water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid{22]color and appearancethe apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids or by reflection of the sky than by water itselflight in the visible electromagnetic spectrum can traverse a couple meters of pure water (or ice) without significant absorption so that it looks transparent and colorless{23] thus aquatic plants algae and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep because sunlight can reach them water vapour is essentially invisible as a gasthrough a thickness of 10 meters or more however the intrinsic color of water (or ice) is visibly turquoise (greenish blue) as its absorption spectrum has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light (1227 mxe2x88x921 at 418xc2xa0nm) the color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness (practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1000 meters of depth) infrared and ultraviolet light on the other hand is strongly absorbed by waterthe refraction index of liquid water (1333 at 20xc2xa0xc2xb0c) is much higher than that of air (10) similar to those of alkanes and ethanol but lower than those of glycerol (1473) benzene (1501) carbon disulfide (1627) and common types of glass (14 to 16) the refraction index of ice (131) is lower than that of liquid waterpolarity and hydrogen bondingsee also: chemical bonding of h2omodel of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of watercapillary action of water compared to mercuryimpact from a water drop causes an upward "rebound" jet surrounded by circular capillary wavessince the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms it is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive water is a good polar solvent that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol most acids dissolve in water to yield the corresponding anions many substances in living organisms such as proteins dna and polysaccharides are dissolved in water water also dissolves many gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxidexe2x80x94the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages sparkling wines and beerson the other hand many organic substances (such as fats and oils and alkanes) are hydrophobic that is insoluble in water many inorganic substances are insoluble too including most metal oxides sulfides and silicatesbecause of its polarity a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules these bonds are the cause of water's high surface tension{24] and capillary forces the capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity this property is relied upon by all vascular plants such as trees{25]the hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide (h2s) they also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 42 jgk) heat of fusion (about 333 jg) heat of vaporization (2257 jg) and thermal conductivity (between 0561 and 0679 wmk) these properties make water more effective at moderating earth's climate by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphereelectrical conductivity and electrolysispure water has a low electrical conductivity which increases with the dissolution of a small amount of ionic material such as common saltliquid water can be split into the elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through itxe2x80x94a process called electrolysis the decomposition requires more energy input than the heat released by the inverse process (2858 kjmol or 159 mjkg){26]mechanical propertiesliquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 44 to

volume{28]the viscosity of water is about 10xe2x88x923 paxc2xb7s or 001 poise at 20xc2xa0xc2xb0c and the speed of sound in liquid water ranges between 1400 and 1540xc2xa0ms depending on temperature sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation especially at low frequencies (roughly 003 dbkm for 1 khz) a property that is exploited by cetaceans and humans for communication and environment sensing (sonar){29]reactivityelements which are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium sodium calcium potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water forming hydroxides and

contains 61 of all fresh water on earth is visible at the bottom condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds contributing to the earth's albedohydrology is the study of the movement distribution

inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of ecohydrologythe collective mass of water found on under and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1338000000xc2xa0km3 (321000000xc2xa0mi3){2]liquid water is found in bodies of water such as an ocean sea lake river stream canal pond or puddle the majority of water on earth is sea water water is also present in the atmosphere in solid liquid and vapor states it also exists as groundwater in aquiferswater is important in many geological processes groundwater is present in most rocks and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones on the surface of the earth water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes water and to a lesser but still significant extent ice are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks which make up the geologic record of earth historywater cyclemain article: water cyclewater cyclethe water cycle (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the hydrosphere between the atmosphere soil water surface water groundwater and plantswater moves perpetually through each of these regions in the water cycle consisting of following transfer processes:evaporation from oceans and other water bodies into the air and transpiration from land plants and animals into airprecipitation from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or oceanrunoff from the land usually reaching the seamost water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea about 47xc2xa0tt per year over land evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72xc2xa0tt per year precipitation at a rate of 119 tt per year over land has several forms: most commonly rain snow and hail with some contribution from fog and dew{30] dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase{31] condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbowswater runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers a mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce through erosion runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers a flood occurs when an area of land usually low-lying is covered with water it is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea a drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitationfresh water storagethe bay of fundy at high tide (left) and low tide (right)main article: water resourcessome runoff water is trapped for periods of time for example in lakes at high altitude during winter and in the far north and south snow collects in ice caps snow pack and glaciers water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers this groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells this water storage is important since clean fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life in many parts of the world it is in short supplysea water and tidesmain articles: seawater and tidessea water contains about 35 sodium chloride on average plus smaller amounts of other substances the physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects it freezes at a lower temperature (about xe2x88x9219xc2xa0xc2xb0c) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing the salinity of water in major seas varies from about 07 in the baltic sea to 40 in the red sea (the dead sea known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30xe2x80x9340 is really a salt lake)tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the moon and the sun acting on the oceans tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams the changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth coupled with the effects of earth rotation and the local bathymetry the strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide the intertidal zone is an important ecological product of ocean tideseffects on lifean oasis is an isolated water source with vegetation in a desertoverview of photosynthesis and respiration water (at right) together with carbon dioxide (co2) form oxygen and organic compounds (at left) which can be respired to water and (co2)from a biological standpoint water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life it carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication all known forms of life depend on water water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism in anabolism water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (eg starches triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information) in catabolism water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (eg glucose fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes) without water these particular metabolic processes could not existwater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen hydrogen is combined with co2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen all living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and co2 in the process (cellular respiration)water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function an acid a hydrogen ion (h+ that is a proton) donor can be neutralized by a base a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (ohxe2x88x92) to form water water is considered to be neutral with a ph (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7 acids have ph values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7aquatic life formsfurther information: hydrobiology marine life and aquatic plantsome of the biodiversity of a coral reefsome marine diatoms xe2x80x93 a key phytoplankton groupearth surface waters are filled with life the earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water and there are many types of marine mammals such as dolphins and whales some kinds of animals such as amphibians spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chainaquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive and they do so in various ways fish have gills instead of lungs although some species of fish such as the lungfish have both marine mammals such as dolphins whales otters and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see insect and mollusc siphons) and gills (carcinus) however as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in watereffects on human civilizationwater fountaincivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; mesopotamia the so-called cradle of civilization was situated between the major rivers tigris and euphrates; the ancient society of the egyptians depended entirely upon the nile rome was also founded on the banks of the italian river tiber large metropolises like rotterdam london montreal paris new york city buenos aires shanghai tokyo chicago and hong kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade islands with safe water ports like singapore have flourished for the same reason in places such as north africa and the middle east where water is more scarce access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human developmenthealth and pollutionan environmental science program xe2x80x93 a student from iowa state university sampling waterwater fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation or by a range of other methodswater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water and is sometimes called safe water or "safe for bathing" chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water and 1xe2x80x932 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water) water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet lightin the usa non-potable forms of wastewater generated by humans may be referred to as greywater which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again and blackwater which generally contains sewage and other forms of waste which require further treatment in order to be made reusable greywater composes 50xe2x80x9380 of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment (sinks showers and kitchen runoff but not toilets which generate blackwater) these terms may have different meanings in other countries and culturesthis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places and its availability is a major social and economic concern currently about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and sanitation during the 2003 g8 evian summit{32] even if this difficult goal is met it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water the world health organization estimates that safe water could prevent 14 million child deaths from diarrhea each year{33]water however is not a finite resource (meaning the availability of water is limited) but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation{34] in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption therefore it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1 of our drinking water supply{citation needed] which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years){citation needed] that is a non-renewable resource and it is rather the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce{clarification needed] rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption){further explanation needed] since the manufacturing process{clarification needed] uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water{clarification needed]in the developing world 90 of all wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams{35] some 50 countries with roughly a third of the world's population also suffer from medium or high water stress and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles{36] the strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes but it also degrades groundwater resourceshuman usesfurther information: water supplyagricultureplay mediawater distribution in subsurface drip irrigationirrigation of field cropsthe most important use of water in agriculture is for irrigation which is a key component to produce enough food irrigation takes up to 90 of water withdrawn in some developing countries{37] and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (in the united states 30 of freshwater usage is for irrigation){38]fifty years ago the common perception was that water was an infinite resource at the time there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet people were not as wealthy as today consumed fewer calories and ate less meat so less water was needed to produce their food they required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers today the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense giving rise to the concept of peak water{39] this is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising and there is increasing competition for water from industry urbanisation and biofuel crops in future even more water will be needed to produce food because the earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050{40]an assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the international water management institute in sri lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population{41] it assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity it found that a fifth of the world's people more than 12 billion live in areas of physical water scarcity where there is not enough water to meet all demands a further 16 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water the report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world to avoid a global water crisis farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently{42]as a scientific standardon 7 april 1795 the gram was defined in france to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter and at the temperature of melting ice"{43] for practical purposes though a metallic reference standard was required one thousand times more massive the kilogram work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water in spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x80x94a highly reproducible temperaturexe2x80x94the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water density which was measured at the time as 4xc2xa0xc2xb0c (39xc2xa0xc2xb0f){44]the kelvin temperature scale of the si system is based on the triple point of water defined as exactly 27316xc2xa0k or 001xc2xa0xc2xb0c the scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the celsius temperature scale which was originally defined according to the boiling point (set to 100xc2xa0xc2xb0c) and melting point (set to 0xc2xa0xc2xb0c) of waternatural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16 but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 (deuterium) the amount of deuterium oxides or heavy water is very small but it still affects the properties of water water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater therefore standard water is defined in the vienna standard mean ocean water specificationfor drinkingmain article: drinking watera young girl drinking bottled waterwater availability: fraction of population using improved water sources by countrythe human body contains from 55 to 78 water depending on body size{45] to function properly the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity temperature humidity and other factors most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water it is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration{46] medical literature favors a lower consumption typically 1 liter of water for an average male excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather{47]for those who have healthy kidneys it is rather difficult to drink too much water but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little people can drink far more water than necessary while exercising however putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration) which can be fatal{48]{49] the popular claim that "a person should consume eight glasses of water per day" seems to have no real basis in science{50] studies have shown that extra water intake especially up to 500xc2xa0ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss{51]{52]{53]{54]{55]{56] adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation{57]hazard symbol for non-potable wateran original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the food and nutrition board of the united states national research council read: "an ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods"{58] the latest dietary reference intake report by the united states national research council in general recommended based on the median total water intake from us survey data (including food sources): 37 liters for men and 27 liters of water total for women noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19 of total water intake in the survey{59]specifically pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated the institute of medicine (us) recommends that on average men consume 30 liters and women 22 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 24 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups) since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing{60] also noted is that normally about 20 of water intake comes from food while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (caffeinated included) water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces through sweating and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath with physical exertion and heat exposure water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as wellhumans require water with few impurities common impurities include metal salts and oxides including copper iron calcium and lead{61] andor harmful bacteria such as vibrio some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes{62]the single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is lake baikal in siberia{63]washingthe propensity of water to form solutions and emulsions is useful in various washing processes many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal body hygienetransportationmain article: ship transportthe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economychemical useswater is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst in inorganic reactions water is a common solvent dissolving many ionic compounds as well as other polar compounds such as ammonia and compounds closely related to water in organic reactions it is not usually used as a reaction solvent because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric (acidic and basic) and nucleophilic nevertheless these properties are sometimes desirable also acceleration of diels-alder reactions by water has been observed supercritical water has recently been a topic of research oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficientlyheat exchangewater and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange due to its availability and high heat capacity both for cooling and heating cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea it's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization a disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam in almost all thermal power stations water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler steam turbine and condenser) and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower) in the united states cooling power plants is the largest use of water{38]in the nuclear power industry water can also be used as a neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors water is both a coolant and a moderator this provides something of a passive safety measure as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down however other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate coolingfire extinctionwater is used for fighting wildfireswater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid the evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire it is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquiduse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a steam explosion which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces and of a hydrogen explosion when substances which react with water such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal charcoal or coke graphite decompose the water producing water gasthe power of such explosions was seen in the chernobyl disaster although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system a steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam a hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot zirconiumrecreationmain article: water sport (recreation)grand anse beach st george's grenada west indieshumans use water for many recreational purposes as well as for exercising and for sports some of these include swimming waterskiing boating surfing and diving in addition some sports like ice hockey and ice skating are played on ice lakesides beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming and fountains and other water features are popular decorations some keep fish and other life in aquariums or ponds for show fun and companionship humans also use water for snow sports ie skiing sledding snowmobiling or snowboarding which require the water to be frozenwater industrya water-carrier in india 1882 in many places where running water is not available water has to be transported by peoplea manual water pump in chinawater purification facilityreverse osmosis (ro) desalination plant in barcelona spainthe water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment) to households and industry water supply facilities include water wells cisterns for rainwater harvesting water supply networks and water purification facilities water tanks water towers water pipes including old aqueducts atmospheric water generators are in developmentdrinking water is often collected at springs extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground or pumped from lakes and rivers building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow other water sources include rainwater collection water may require purification for human consumption this may involve removal of undissolved substances dissolved substances and harmful microbes popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes distillation does all three functions more advanced techniques exist such as reverse osmosis desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climatesthe distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems tanker delivery or as bottled water governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no chargereducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option in some cities such as hong kong sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resourcespolluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water it becomes a waste of the resource regardless of benefits to the polluter like other types of pollution this does not enter standard accounting of market costs being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account thus other people pay the price of water pollution while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population victims of this pollution pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradablemunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques (see surface runoffmitigation and treatment)industrial applicationswater is used in power generation hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator hydroelectricity is a low-cost non-polluting renewable energy source the energy is supplied by the motion of water typically a dam is constructed on a river creating an artificial lake behind it water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generatorsthree gorges dam is the largest hydro-electric power stationpressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters also very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting it works very well is relatively safe and is not harmful to the environment it is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating or prevent saw blades from overheatingwater is also used in many industrial processes and machines such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger in addition to its use as a chemical solvent discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution) industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and dischargefood processingwater can be used to cook foods such as noodlesboiling steaming and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state steam water is also used for dishwashing water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science it is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products{citation needed]solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water the boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes as well as air pressure which is in turn is affected by altitude water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations one mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 051xc2xa0xc2xb0c (0918xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 102xc2xa0xc2xb0c (1836xc2xa0xc2xb0f); similarly increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point{64]solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food{65] water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water{64] solutes in water lower water activityxe2x80x94this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity{65] not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food but also the preservation and shelf life of foodwater hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system it can dramatically affect the quality of a product as well as playing a role in sanitation water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100xc2xa0mgl (uk){66] or less than 60xc2xa0mgl (usa){67]according to a report published by the water footprint organization in 2010 a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production{68]medical usesterile water for injectionwater for injection is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines{69]distribution in naturein the universeband 5 alma receiver is an instrument specifically designed to detect water in the universe{70]much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of star formation the formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust when this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas the water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas{71]on 22 july 2011 a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing "140 trillion times more water than all of earth's oceans combined" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from earth according to the researchers the "discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence"{72]{73]water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy the milky way{74] water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies too because its components hydrogen and oxygen are among the most abundant elements in the universe based on models of the formation and evolution of the solar system and that of other star systems most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredientswater vaporwater is present as vapor in:atmosphere of the sun: in detectable trace amounts{75]atmosphere of mercury: 34 and large amounts of water in mercury's

present in small amounts on mars scientists believe liquid water is present in the saturnian moons of enceladus as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30xe2x80x9340 kilometres below enceladus' south polar surface{95]{96] and titan as a subsurface layer possibly mixed with ammonia{97] jupiter's moon europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean{98] liquid water may also exist on jupiter's moon ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock{99]water icewater is present as ice on:south polar ice cap of mars during martian south summer 2000mars: under the regolith and at the polesearth-moon system: mainly as ice sheets on earth and in lunar craters and volcanic rocks{100] nasa reported the detection of water molecules by nasa's moon

poles{103]cerestethysexotic formswater and other volatiles probably comprise much of the internal structures of uranus and neptune and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of ionic water in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions and deeper still as superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice{104]water and habitable zonefurther information: water distribution on earththe existence of liquid water and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms on earth are vital to the existence of life on earth as we know it the earth is located in the habitable zone of the solar system; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the sun (about 5 or about 8 million kilometers) the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist{105]{106]earth's gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer (greenhouse effect) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature if earth were smaller a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on mars)the surface temperature of earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (insolation) indicating that a dynamic process governs earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo this proposal is known as the gaia hypothesisthe state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure which is determined by the planet's gravity if a planet is sufficiently massive the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures because of the high pressure caused by gravity as it was observed on exoplanets gliese 436 b{107] and gj 1214 b{108]law politics and crisismain articles: water law water right and water

a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts it causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity16 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990{109] the proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 in 1970{110] to 71 in 1990 79 in 2000 and 84 in 2004 this trend is projected to continue{5] to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water is one of the millennium development goals this goal is projected to be reacheda 2006 united nations report stated that "there is enough water for everyone" but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption{111] in addition global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery such as the paris declaration on aid effectiveness have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act{112]the authors of the 2007 comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts the mekong river is one example; a review by the international water management institute of policies in six countries that rely on the mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken they also discovered that cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be{113]the un world water development report (wwdr 2003) from the world water assessment program indicates that in the next 20 years the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30 40 of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene more than 22 million people died in 2000 from waterborne diseases (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought in 2004 the uk charity wateraid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of sewage disposal; see toiletorganizations concerned with water protection include the international water association (iwa) wateraid water 1st and the american water resources association

christianity hinduism islam judaism the rastafari movement shinto taoism and wicca immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central sacrament of christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions including islam (ghusl) judaism (mikvah) and sikhism (amrit sanskar) in addition a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including islam and judaism in islam the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (wudu) unless water is unavailable (see tayammum) in shinto water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (eg in the ritual of misogi)in christianity holy water is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of baptism the blessing of persons places and objects or as a means of repelling evil{114]{115]philosophythe ancient greek philosopher empedocles held that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire earth and air and was regarded as the ylem or basic substance of the universe thales who was portrayed by aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer theorized that the earth which is denser than water emerged from the water thales a monist believed further that all things are made from water plato believed the shape of water is an icosahedron which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth{116]in the theory of the four bodily humors water was associated with phlegm as being cold and moist the classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional chinese philosophy along with earth fire wood and metalwater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular asian philosophy james legge's 1891 translation of the dao de jing states "the highest excellence is like (that of) water the excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things and in its occupying without striving (to the contrary) the low place which all men dislike hence (its way) is near to (that of) the tao" and "there is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of itxe2x80x94for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed"{117] guanzi in "shui di" xe6xb0xb4xe5x9cxb0
