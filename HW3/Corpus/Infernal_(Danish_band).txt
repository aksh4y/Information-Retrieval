(1997xe2x80x932003){edit]infernal started out as a three-piece band in 1997 lina paw and the third being sxc3xb8ren haahr but sxc3xb8ren left the group in 2000 initially they were known for their unconventional style of singing as well as their experimental blend of different genres of music in recent years they have turned towards more songwriting and their sound have gone from a subgenre club-sound to dance-oriented pop-sound aimed at the charts an example of their early musical experiments is their track "kalinka" which is based on the russian drobushki folk melody from 1998 to 2004 the band released four albums in their native denmark three studio albums one of them being a re-issue and one remixlive compilation album all of them spawned top 10 hits in denmark for example "sunrise" "muzaik" "kiss the sky" "kalinka" and "you receive me" the latter being the theme song for a danish season of the tv show big brotherinternational breakthrough (2004xe2x80x932007){edit]in

control" it was a cover of a 1984 song by italian pop singer raf which was also covered by laura branigan that same year the infernal version stalled at 18 in the uk charts and 14 in ireland the
