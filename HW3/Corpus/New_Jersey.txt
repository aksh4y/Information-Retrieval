location at the center of the northeast megalopolis between boston and new york city to the northeast and philadelphia baltimore and washington dc to the southwest fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century in the first decades of the 21st century this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of new jersey's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state{25]{26] with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since

new jersey bordered north africa the pressure of the collision between north america and africa gave rise to the appalachian mountains around 18000 years ago the ice age resulted in glaciers that reached new jersey as the glaciers retreated they left behind lake passaic as well as many rivers swamps and gorges{28]new jersey was originally settled by native americans with the lenni-lenape being dominant at the time of contact scheyichbi is the lenape name for the land that is now new jersey{29] the lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the delaware river the lower hudson river and western long island sound the lenape society was divided into matrilinear clans that were based upon common female ancestors these clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign: turtle turkey and wolf they first encountered the dutch in the early 17th century and their primary relationship with the europeans was through fur tradecolonial eramain article: colonial history of new jerseythe relative location of the new netherland and new sweden settlements in eastern north americathe dutch became the first europeans to lay claim to lands in new jersey the dutch colony of new netherland consisted of parts of modern middle atlantic states although the european principle of land ownership was not recognized by the lenape dutch west india company policy required its colonists to purchase the land that they settled the first to do so was michiel pauw who established a patronship called pavonia in 1630 along the north river which eventually became the bergen peter minuit's purchase of lands along the delaware river established the colony of new sweden the entire region became a territory of england on june 24 1664 after an english fleet under the command of colonel richard nicolls sailed into what is today new york harbor and took control of fort amsterdam annexing the entire provinceduring the english civil war the channel island of jersey remained loyal to the british crown and gave sanctuary to the king it was from the royal square in st helier that charles ii of england was proclaimed king in 1649 following the execution of his father charles i the north american lands were divided by charles ii who gave his brother the duke of york (later king james ii) the region between new england and maryland as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony) james then granted the land between the hudson river and the delaware river (the land that would become new jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the english civil war: sir george carteret and lord berkeley of stratton{30] the area was named the province of new jerseysince the state's inception new jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity new england congregationalists settled alongside scots presbyterians and dutch reformed migrants while the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of 100 acres (40xc2xa0ha) a few rich proprietors owned vast estates english quakers and anglicans owned large landholdings unlike plymouth colony jamestown and other colonies new jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from europe new jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era and commercial farming developed sporadically some townships such as burlington on the delaware river and perth amboy emerged as important ports for shipping to new york city and philadelphia the colony's fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers and new jersey's population had increased to 120000 by 1775settlement for the first 10 years of english rule took place along hackensack river and arthur kill xe2x80x93 settlers came primarily from new york and new england on march 18 1673 berkeley sold his half of the colony to quakers in england who settled the delaware valley region as a quaker colony (william penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time) new jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces east and west jersey for 28 years between 1674 and 1702 at times part of the province of new york or dominion of new englandin 1702 the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor rather than a proprietary one edward hyde lord cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler taking bribes and speculating on land in 1708 he was recalled to england new jersey was then ruled by the governors of new york but this infuriated the settlers of new jersey who accused those governors of favoritism to new york judge lewis morris led the case for a separate governor and was appointed governor by king george ii in 1738{31]revolutionary war eramain article: new jersey in the american revolutionnew jersey was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution the new jersey constitution of 1776 was passed july 2 1776 just two days before the

general cornwallis's charges at the second battle of trenton by evading cornwallis's army washington made a surprise attack on princeton and successfully defeated the british forces there on january 3 1777 emanuel leutze's painting of washington crossing the delaware became an icon of the revolutionamerican forces under washington met the forces under general henry clinton at the battle of monmouth in an indecisive engagement in june 1778 washington attempted to take the british column by surprise; when the british army attempted to flank the americans the americans retreated in disorder the ranks were later reorganized and withstood the british chargesin the summer of 1783 the continental congress met in nassau hall at princeton university making princeton the nation's capital for four months it was there that the continental congress learned of the signing of the treaty of paris (1783) which ended the waron december 18 1787 new jersey became the third state to ratify the united states constitution which was overwhelmingly popular in new jersey as it prevented new york and pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from europe on november 20 1789 the state became the first in the newly formed union to ratify the bill of rightsthe 1776 new jersey state constitution gave the vote to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth this included women and blacks but not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands both sides in several elections claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of "petticoat electors" whether entitled to vote or not; on the other hand both parties passed voting rights acts in 1807 the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution{34]19th centurymain article: new jersey in the

creation of mercer county) immediately followed this provision was retained in the 1947 constitution but was overturned by the supreme court of the united states in 1962 by the decision baker v carr while the governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him or to the people and it gave him a three-year term but he could not succeed himselfnew jersey was one of the few union states (the others being delaware and kentucky) to select a candidate other than abraham lincoln twice in national elections and sided with stephen douglas (1860) and george b mcclellan (1864) during their campaigns mcclellan a native philadelphian had new jersey ties and formally resided in new jersey at the time; he later

ones; most recently union county in 1857 new jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called "freeholders" governing each county as part of its own board of chosen freeholders the number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum and must consist of three five seven or nine membersdepending on the county the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the board of chosen freeholders or split into separate branches of government in 16 counties members of the board of chosen freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis with each freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments in the other 5 counties (atlantic bergen essex hudson and mercer) there is a directly elected county executive who performs the executive functions while the board of chosen freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role in counties without an executive a county administrator (or county manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functionsmunicipalitiesnew jersey currently has 565 municipalities; the number was 566 before princeton township and

largely driven by reform-minded goals a series of six modern forms of government was implemented this began with the walsh act enacted in 1911 by the new jersey legislature which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis this was followed by the 1923 municipal manager law which offered a non-partisan council provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council and introduced a council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairsthe faulkner act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981 offers four basic plans: mayor-council council-manager small municipality and mayor-council-administrator the act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters most large municipalities and a majority of new jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with faulkner act charters municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a special charter with the approval of the new jersey legislature{citation needed]while municipalities retain their names derived from types of government they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public for example though there
