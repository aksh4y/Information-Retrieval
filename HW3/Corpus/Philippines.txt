western pacific ocean it consists of about 7641 islands{17] that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: luzon visayas and mindanao the capital city of the philippines is manila and the most populous city is quezon city both part of metro manila{18] bounded by the south china sea on the west the philippine sea on the east and the celebes sea on the southwest the philippines shares maritime borders with taiwan to the north vietnam to the west palau to the east and malaysia and indonesia to the souththe philippines' location on the pacific ring of fire and close to the equator makes the philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world's greatest biodiversity the philippines has an area of 300000 square kilometers (115831xc2xa0sqxc2xa0mi){19] and a population of approximately 103 million{20] it is the eighth-most populated country in asia and the 12th most populated country in the world as of 2013{update] approximately 10 million additional filipinos lived overseas{21] comprising one of the world's largest diasporas multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands in prehistoric times negritos were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants they were followed by successive waves of austronesian peoples{22] exchanges with chinese malay indian and islamic nations occurred then various competing maritime states were established under the rule of datus rajahs sultans or lakansthe arrival of ferdinand magellan in homonhon eastern samar in 1521 marked the beginning of hispanic colonization in 1543 spanish explorer ruy lxc3xb3pez de villalobos named the archipelago las islas filipinas in honor of philip ii of spain with the arrival of miguel lxc3xb3pez de legazpi from mexico city in 1565 the first hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established{23] the philippines became part of the spanish empire for more than 300 years this resulted in catholicism becoming the dominant religion during this time manila became the western hub of the trans-pacific trade connecting asia with acapulco in the americas using manila galleons{24]as the 19thxc2xa0century gave way to the 20th there followed in quick succession the philippine revolution which spawned the short-lived first philippine republic followed by the bloody philippinexe2x80x93american war of conquest by us military force{25] aside from the period of japanese occupation the united states retained sovereignty over the islands until after world war ii when the philippines was recognized as an independent nation since then the philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution{26]it is a founding member of the united nations world trade organization association of southeast asian nations the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum and the east asia summit it also hosts the headquarters of the asian development bank{27] the philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country{28] which has an economy transitioning from being one

eventually the name las islas filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago before that became commonplace other names such as islas del poniente (islands of the west) and magellan's name for the islands san lxc3xa1zaro were also used by the spanish to refer to the islands{30]{31]{32]{33]{34]the official name of the philippines has changed several times in the course of its history during the philippine revolution the malolos congress proclaimed the establishment of the repxc3xbablica filipina or the philippine republic from the period of the spanishxe2x80x93american war (1898) and the philippinexe2x80x93american war (1899xe2x80x931902) until the commonwealth period (1935xe2x80x9346) american colonial authorities referred to the country as the philippine islands a translation of the spanish name{25] from the 1898 treaty of paris the name philippines began to appear and it has since become the country's common name since the end of world war ii the official name of the country has been the republic of the philippines{35]historymain article: history of the philippinesprehistoryfurther information: prehistory of the philippinesthe tabon caves are the site of one of the oldest human remains known in the philippines the tabon manthe metatarsal of the callao man reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date{36] this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan carbon-dated to around 26500 years ago{37]{38] negritos were also among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated{39]there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos f landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally wilhelm solheim's island origin theory{40] postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48000 to 5000xc2xa0bc rather than by wide-scale migration the austronesian expansion theory explains that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000xc2xa0bc displacing earlier arrivals{41]the most widely accepted theory based on linguistic and archeological evidence is the "out-of-taiwan" model which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture{42] began migrating to the philippines around 4000xc2xa0bc displacing earlier arrivals{41]{43] during the neolithic period a "jade culture" is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000xc2xa0bc{44]{45]the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies{46] by 1000xc2xa0bc the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups: hunter-gatherer tribes warrior societies highland plutocracies and port principalities{47]precolonial epochfurther information: history of the philippines (900xe2x80x931521) religion in pre-colonial philippines and cultural achievements of pre-colonial philippinesa boxer codex image illustrating the ancient kadatuan or tumao (noble class)the current demarcation between the prehistory and the early history of the philippines is 21 april 900 which is the equivalent on the proleptic gregorian calendar for the date indicated on the laguna copperplate inscriptionxe2x80x94the earliest known surviving written record to come from the philippines{48] this date came in the middle of what anthropologists refer to as the philippines' "emergent phase" (1stxe2x80x9314th centuries ce) which was characterized by newly emerging socio-cultural patterns the initial development of large coastal settlements greater social stratification and specialization and the beginnings of local and international trade{49] by the 1300s a number of the large coastal settlements had become progressive trading centers and became the focal point of societal changes ushering complex lifeways which characterized what f landa jocano called the "barangic phase" of early philippine history beginning from the 14th century through the arrival of spanish colonizers and the beginning of the philippines' colonial period{49]the discovery of iron at around the 1st century ad created significant social and economic changes which allowed settlements to grow larger and develop new social patterns characterized by social stratification and specialization{49]some of these polities particularly the coastal settlements at or near the mouths of large rivers{50] eventually developed substantial trade contacts with the early trading powers of southeast asia most importantly the indianized kingdoms of malaysia and java the various dynasties of china{50] thailand{51] and later the muslim sultanate of brunei{52] they also traded with vietnam{51] japan{53] and other austronesian islands{54]based on archeological findings trade with china is believed to have begun in the tang dynasty but grew more extensive during the song dynasty{52] by the 2nd millennium ce some (but not all) philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the tributary system enforced by the chinese imperial court{52] these "tributary states" nominally acknowledged the sinocentric system which saw china and the imperial court as the cultural center of the world among the early philippine polities this arrangement fulfilled the requirements for trade with china but did not actually translate into political or military control{52]{50]the ifugaoigorot people utilized terrace farming in the steep mountainous regions of northern philippines over 2000 years agoregarding the relations of early philippine polities with the various state-level polities of indonesia and malaysia legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early philippine polities with the srivijaya empire but there is not much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship{49] considerable evidence exists on the other hand for extensive trade with the majapahit empire{55]the exact scope and mechanisms of indian cultural influences on early philippine polities are still the subject of some debate among southeast asian historiographers{49]{56] but the current scholarly consensus is that there was probably little or no direct trade between india and the philippines{49]{56] and indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices{55] filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries through early philippine polities' relations with the hindu majapahit empire{49] the philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries (others include afghanistan and southern vietnam) just at the outer edge of what is considered the "greater indian cultural zone"{56]the early polities of the philippine archipelago were typically characterized by a three-tier social structure{49]{50] although different cultures had different terms to describe them this three-tier structure invariably consisted of an apex nobility class a class of "freemen" and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen called "alipin" or "oripun"{49]{50] among the members of the nobility class were leaders who held the political office of "datu" which was responsible for leading autonomous social groups called "barangay" or "dulohan"{49] whenever these barangays banded together either to form a larger settlement{49] or a geographically looser alliance group{50] the more senior or respected among them would be recognized as a "paramount datu" variedly called a lakan sultan rajah or simply a more senior datu{52]{49]{57]early historic coastal politiesthe laguna copperplate inscription c 900 the oldest known historical record found in the philippines discovered at lumban lagunathe earliest historical record of these kingdoms is the laguna copperplate inscription which indirectly refers to the tagalog settlement of tondo (cxe2x80x89before 900xe2x80x931589) and two to three other settlements believed to be located somewhere near tondo as well as a settlement near mt diwata in mindanao and the temple complex of medang in java{48] although the precise political relationships between these polities is unclear in the text of the inscription the artifact is usually accepted as evidence of intra- and inter-regional political linkages as early as 900 ce{48]{52]{50] by the arrival of the earliest european ethnographers during the 1500s tondo was led by the paramount ruler called a "lakan"{52]{50] it had grown into a major trading hub sharing a monopoly with the rajahnate of maynila over the trade of ming dynasty{58] products throughout the archipelago{52] this trade was significant enough that the yongle emperor appointed a chinese governor named ko ch'a-lao to oversee it{59]{60]the next historical record referred a location in the philippines is volume 186 of official history of the song dynasty which describes the "country" of ma-i (cxe2x80x89before 971 xe2x80x93 after 1339) song dynasty traders visited ma-i annually and their accounts described ma-i's geography trade products and the trade behaviors of its rulers{61] because the descriptions of mai's location in these accounts are not clear there is some dispute about mai's possible location with some scholars believing it was located in bay laguna{62] and others believing it was on the island of mindoro{38]the butuan ivory seal (cxe2x80x891002) was recovered in the 1970s in butuanthe official history of the song dynasty next refers to the rajahnate of butuan (cxe2x80x89before 1001xe2x80x931756) in northeastern mindanao which is the first polity from the philippine archipelago recorded as having sent a tribute mission to the chinese empire xe2x80x93 on march 17 1001 ce butuan attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja{54] who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and it also had commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilizationthe kedatuan of madja-as (cxe2x80x891200xe2x80x931569) was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah called makatunao and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas its founding datu puti had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero marikudo{63]{verification needed] madja-as was founded on panay island (named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra) afterwards the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy{64]the rajahnate of cebu{65] (cxe2x80x891200xe2x80x931565) was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay a monarch with partial tamil descent this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping within the archipelago{66] both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu were allied to each other and they also maintained contact and had trade routes with kutai a hindu country{67] in south borneo established by indian traders{68]the earliest legendary date mentioning the rajahnate of maynila (cxe2x80x891258xe2x80x931571) on the island of luzon across the pasig river from tondo has to do with the naval victory of the bruneian rajah ahmad over the majapahit rajah avirjirkaya who ruled a prior pre-muslim settlement in the same location{52] chinese records of this period also mention a polity called "luzon" this is believed to be a reference to maynila since portuguese and spanish accounts from the 1520s explicitly state that "luxc3xa7on" and "maynila" were "one and the same"{52] although some historians argue that since none of these observers actually visited maynila "luxc3xa7on" may simply have referred to all the tagalog and kapampangan polities that rose up on the shores of manila bay{69] either way from the early 1500s to as late as the 1560s this seafaring people was referred to in portuguese malacca as luxc3xa7xc3xb5es and they participated in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar malacca and east timor{70]{71]{72] where they were employed as traders and mercenaries{73]{74]{75]in northern luzon the wangdom of pangasinan (cxe2x80x891406xe2x80x931576) sent emissaries to china in 1406xe2x80x931411{76]map showing the extent of the sultanate of sulu in 1822the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago in 1380 karim ul' makdum and shari'ful hashem syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu's rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter{77]{78] at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao{79]islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 this was accomplished because the sultanate of brunei subjugated tondo by defeating rajah gambang in battle and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah salalila to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the rajahnate of maynila{80]{81]{82]{83] sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei's influence in both luzon and mindanao{84] the muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the visayans{85] participating in the muslim raids the sultanate of ternate consequently destroyed the kedatuan of dapitan in bohol{86] the rajahnates of butuan and cebu also endured slave raids from and waged wars against the sultanate of maguindanao{87]the rivalries between the datus rajahs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated{88] due to consistent natural disasters{89] and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized{90]colonial eraspanish rulefurther information: history of the philippines (1521xe2x80x931898)a sketch of a manila galleon used during the manila-acapulco tradein 1521 portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan's expedition arrived in the philippines claimed the islands for spain and was then killed at the battle of mactan{91] colonization began when spanish explorer miguel lxc3xb3pez de legazpi arrived from mexico in 1565 and formed the first hispanic settlements in cebu after relocating to panay island and consolidating a coalition of native visayan allies hispanic soldiers and latin-american recruits the spaniards then invaded islamic manila therein they put down the tondo conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to guam and guerrero{92] under spanish rule they established manila as the capital of the spanish east indies (1571){93]they also defeated the chinese warlord limahong{94]{95] to counteract the islamization of the philippines the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei{96]{97] and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore (in response to ternatean slaving and piracy against spain's allies: bohol and butuan){98] the spanish considered their war with the muslims in southeast asia an extension of the reconquista a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the spanish homeland which was invaded by the muslims of the umayyad caliphate the spanish expeditions into the philippines were also part of a larger ibero-islamic world conflict{99] that included a rivalry with the ottoman caliphate which had a center of operations at its nearby vassal the sultanate of aceh{100] consequently fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the newly christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the kingdom of tungning{101] however the planned invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas{102]spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago from 1565 to 1821 the philippines was governed as a territory of the mexico-based viceroyalty of new spain and then was administered directly from madrid after the mexican war of independence the manila galleons the largest wooden ships ever built were constructed in bicol and cavite{103] the manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from manila and acapulco{104] the galleons sailed once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries{105] the manila galleons brought with them goods{106] settlers{107] and military reinforcements destined for the philippines from latin america{108]the landing of the spanish expedition to sulu by antonio brugadatrade introduced foodstuffs such as maize tomatoes potatoes chili peppers chocolate and pineapples from mexico and peru within the philippines the marquisate of buglas was established and the rule of it was awarded to sebastian elcano and his crew the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world as well as his descendants new towns were also created{95] and catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to christianity{109] they also founded schools a university hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style{110] to defend their settlements the spaniards constructed and manned a network of military fortresses (called "presidios") across the archipelago{111] the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863{112] as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially{113]{114]during its rule spain quelled various indigenous revolts there were also several external military challenges from chinese and japanese pirates the dutch the english the portuguese and the muslims of southeast asia those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from japan to indonesia british forces occupied manila from 1762 to 1764 in an extension of the fighting of the seven years' war spanish rule was restored following the 1763 treaty of paris{90]{115]{116] the spanishxe2x80x93moro conflict lasted for several hundred years in the

mixed ancestry (mestizos) became wealthy and an influx of latin american immigrants{118] opened up government positions traditionally held by spaniards born in the iberian peninsula (peninsulares) the ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 cavite mutiny that was a precursor to the philippine revolution{90]{119]{120]{121]revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priestsxe2x80x94mariano gxc3xb3mez josxc3xa9 burgos and jacinto zamora (collectively known as
