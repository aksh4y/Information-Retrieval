(2001 usd)areas affectedbermuda atlantic canadapart of the 2001 atlantic hurricane seasonhurricane karen was a hurricane of non-tropical origin that formed in october of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season it developed out of the interaction between a cold front and an upper level trough on october 10 located to the south of bermuda and quickly strengthened as an extratropical storm the storm passed near bermuda on october 12 producing hurricane-force winds on the island it then organized becoming a subtropical cyclone on the 12th and a tropical cyclone on the 13th karen strengthened to reach 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) winds as a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale and after weakening over cooler waters it made landfall on nova scotia as a tropical storm it quickly became extratropicalon bermuda winds from the precursor extratropical storm produced moderate damage primarily to power lines and marine interests over 23 of the island's power subscribers were left without power during the worst of the storm and several boats sank or ran aground from the high winds damage on bermuda totaled to over 14xc2xa0million (2001xc2xa0usd; 17xc2xa0million

referencesmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea cold front stalled a couple hundred miles southeast of bermuda on october 10 during that day a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the united states due to several factors including upward motion and strong diffluencexe2x80x94the rate at which a fluid movesxe2x80x94the area became baroclinically unstable this caused the interaction between the trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345xc2xa0miles (555xc2xa0km) southeast of bermuda on october 11 the low moved quickly northward then northwestward strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere late on october 11 the system slowed and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation the extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on october 11 including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone based on its organization the system developed into subtropical storm one early on october 12 while located about 35xc2xa0miles (55xc2xa0km) south of bermuda{1]while passing to the south of bermuda the subtropical storm maintained winds of 70xc2xa0mph (110xc2xa0kmh) with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) after becoming dissociated from the westerlies the system turned northward and began to develop convection over the center in addition the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened on october 13 based on an advanced microwave sounding unit observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system the national hurricane center designated the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name karen at this point karen was located 200xc2xa0miles (320xc2xa0km) north of bermuda{1] karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the gulf stream{2] and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on october 13{1] convection continued to develop and organized into a ring around the eye as karen reached its peak intensity of 80xc2xa0mph (130xc2xa0kmh) on october 14 while located about 400xc2xa0miles (640xc2xa0km) south of halifax nova scotia{1]{3]tropical storm karen shortly after landfall in nova scotia on october 15karen quickly weakened as it moved over cooler waters{3] and late on october 14 it degenerated back into a tropical storm as it accelerated northward{4] convection gradually decreased{5] and karen made landfall on southwestern nova scotia with winds of 45xc2xa0mph (70xc2xa0kmh) on october 15{1] karen retained its tropical characteristics during and after making landfall based on a research flight out of halifax intended to study the early stages of extratropical transition the flight reported arced bands and a warm-core system transitioning into a more typical mid-latitude system{6] under the influence of a mid-latitude system the storm turned sharply to the northeast and after losing the remaining of its convection it became extratropical shortly after landfall continuing northward the remnant low quickly weakened and dissipated as it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the gulf of saint lawrence{1]preparations{edit]on october 10 as the precursor extratropical storm was forming the bermuda weather service issued a gale and later a storm warning for the island expecting winds of 50 to 60xc2xa0mph (60 to 95xc2xa0kmh) several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm many residents believed they were insufficiently warned though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings on october 12 as the storm was passing to the south of the island officials closed all schools and government offices many private businesses closed as well{7]at the time of karen's landfall gale warnings were issued for coastal waters while inland wind warnings were in effect for cape breton in addition heavy rainfall warnings were issued for large portions of nova scotia including halifax southeastern new brunswick fundy national park and prince edward island{6]impact{edit]bermuda{edit]subtropical storm karen passing near bermuda on october 12while passing to the south of the island the tight pressure gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island including sustained winds of hurricane status at fort george gusts on the island officially peaked at 100xc2xa0mph (161xc2xa0kmh) at devonshire a cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118xc2xa0mph (190xc2xa0kmh) though it could have been caused by a downdraft{1] the storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3xc2xa0inches (76xc2xa0mm){8] resulting in minor flooding of streets{1] because the storm developed quickly wave-induced beach erosion was minor{7]the strong winds left considerable tree and powerline damage at the worst of the storm 23000 of the island's 30000xc2xa0power subscribers were without electricity{1] damage to power lines totaled to 385000 (2001xc2xa0usd 468700 2008xc2xa0usd){9] the strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation three cruise ships weathered the storm at saint george harbour where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line leaving a ship drifting in the harbor one crew member was minorly injured over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings resulting in them running aground or sinking{1] in all 87xc2xa0boats were affected to some degree with marine damage totaling to about 665000 (2001xc2xa0usd 809600 2008xc2xa0usd) the winds also caused minor damage to 175xc2xa0properties on the island primarily to houses damage to houses amounted to about 425000 (2001xc2xa0usd 517400 2008xc2xa0usd){10] overall damage was moderate totaling to about 14xc2xa0million (2001xc2xa0usd 17xc2xa0million 2008xc2xa0usd) no fatalities were reported though a few storm-related injuries occurred{7]canada{edit]tropical storm karen produced light to moderate winds across atlantic canada peaking at 47xc2xa0mph (76xc2xa0kmh) with a gust of 64xc2xa0mph (103xc2xa0kmh) in cape george in antigonish county nova scotia along with a 26xc2xa0mph (42xc2xa0kmh) report in charlottetown prince edward island{1] rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 18xc2xa0inches (46xc2xa0mm) in yarmouth nova scotia and 14xc2xa0inches (35xc2xa0mm) in saint john new brunswick most of which fell in a short amount of time skewed to the left side of the transitioning storm{6] the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of nova scotia and new brunswick due to the fast-moving nature of the storm though most areas reported only around half an inch of rain{1] a buoy in halifax harbour reported wave heights of up to 167xc2xa0feet (51xc2xa0m) causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean damage in canada was minor due to the storm limited to an uprooted tree in new glasgow nova scotia and several other trees with damaged branches{6] there were no injuries or fatalities in canada{1]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalother storms of the same namelist of
