it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone though the organization of the convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone forecasters had predicted the depression would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65xc2xa0mph (105xc2xa0kmh){6] however the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into tropical storm juan by early septemberxc2xa025{1] juan moved northwestward at around 10xc2xa0mph (16xc2xa0kmh) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east{7] on septemberxc2xa026 an eye feature developed and very deep convection increased around the circulation{8] the cloud pattern continued to consolidate and juan attained hurricane status later on septemberxc2xa026 while located 165xc2xa0mi (270xc2xa0km) southeast of bermuda{1] the hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear allowing for additional strengthening; by septemberxc2xa027 juan had attained a peak intensity of 105xc2xa0mph (165xc2xa0kmh) while located 635xc2xa0mi (1020xc2xa0km) south of halifax nova scotia at this peak strength the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast{9]hurricane juan making landfall in nova scotia on september 29hurricane juan remained at peak intensity for over 24xc2xa0hours after moving northwestward for an extended period of time it turned and accelerated to the north{1] the eye became less distinct on septemberxc2xa028 and the hurricane weakened slightly due to its fast forward motion juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between shad bay and prospect (near halifax) on septemberxc2xa029 with winds of 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh){1]{10] it weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern canadian maritimes and crossing the nova scotia peninsula as a hurricane juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over prince edward island by early septemberxc2xa029 later that afternoon the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern gulf of saint lawrence{1]preparations{edit]the first advisories were issued by the canadian hurricane centre on septemberxc2xa026 although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for wind and rain across atlantic canada{11] as juan approached on septemberxc2xa027 warning broadcasts on local media in atlantic canada were changed accordingly the public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster after the chc bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges as well as power outages{12]on the morning of septemberxc2xa028 reports indicated that juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal categoryxc2xa01 hurricane{13] weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall by 6 pm adt (2100 utc) additional warnings had been issued since juan was expected to make landfall as a strong categoryxc2xa01 or weak categoryxc2xa02 hurricane{14] most businesses in the areas affected were closed on sundays which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute{15] although no large-scale evacuations were made local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of september 28 in all several hundred people were affected by these evacuations utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit preparing for large-scale power outages{16]impact{edit]nova scotia{edit]debris on the streets of halifax following the hurricanehurricane juan's maximum sustained wind speed at landfall in nova scotia was measured at 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh){1] the urban concentration surrounding halifax harbour bore the brunt of the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh){17] wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of halifax harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65xc2xa0ft (20xc2xa0m) significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour particularly in the bedford basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action storm surges of 5 to 7xc2xa0feet (15 to 2xc2xa0m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in halifax harbour{18] rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm there were no rainfall reports greater than 2xc2xa0inches (52xc2xa0mm){19]juan caused widespread structural and vegetation damage across the region particularly in and around the halifax regional municipality extensive damage to trees was reported which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines many homes and businesses suffered property damage particularly roof damage on structures and some weaker structures were destroyed{2] hrm estimated that 31 of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27 of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim{20] in downtown halifax erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from halifax harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers the victoria general hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences{21] billboards and signs were also destroyed and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris{2] the city's cherished point pleasant park and public gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for monthsdamage to the halifax public gardens after hurricane juanjuan set an all-time maximum wind gust speed record at the halifax stanfield international airport; during the peak of the storm a gust reached 143xc2xa0kmh a record which still stands to this day another high windspeed occurred at the mcnabs island autostation which recorded a 2-minute sustained wind of 151xc2xa0kmh with gusts to 176xc2xa0kmh hurricane-force gusts extended as far east as beaver island where gusts reached 132xc2xa0kmh the hurricane was strong enough to destroy the anemometers at shannon hill chebucto head and sambro island even though the sambro island instrument had survived a 193xc2xa0kmh storm some years earlier{22]the hurricane caused severe damage to shipping in halifax harbour a visiting recreational schooner named larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the maritime museum of the atlantic and a harbour tour ketch mar was driven ashore in eastern passage on the opposite side of halifax harbour another harbour tour vessel the tern schooner silva broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the cable wharf on the halifax waterfront dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the bedford basin and northwest arm dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the south end container terminal wharves on the halifax and dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the bedford basin near millview coastal flooding was also reported around halifax harbour as a result of the storm surge{18] although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to juan's fast forward movement{2]less severe property damage was recorded west of the storm's track into st margarets bay and mahone bay in addition to halifax regional municipality's urban core the town of truro and all of rural colchester county as well as the western part of pictou county experienced property damage and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path including a replica of the hector in pictou harbour{2] the severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of halifax and dartmouth of halifax regional municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that juan was likely a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane; however the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion many of the deciduous trees in central nova scotia still had leaves which magnified the effects of wind damage{23] overall the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions{2]juan claimed six lives (two directly) in nova scotia both of the direct deaths were due to fallen trees; one was a halifax paramedic and the other was a motorist in enfield{24] three of the four indirect deaths were as a result of a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut and the fourth was in relief work after the storm{2]rest of atlantic canada{edit]rainfall from hurricane juanwhen the storm tracked across nova scotia and into the northumberland strait it was still a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane weakening to a tropical storm as it emerged into the gulf of saint lawrence wind gusts of 86xc2xa0mph (139xc2xa0kmh) were reported in charlottetown{3] and 67xc2xa0mph (107xc2xa0kmh) in the iles de la madeleine in the gulf of saint lawrence{1]damage was also reported in prince edward island as a result of the storm particularly around charlottetown where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core extensive tree damage was also reported across the island as well as structural damage to weaker buildings such as barns and silos{2] the hurricane left portions of the island without power{25] the narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in new brunswick or western prince edward island{26] voting in the pei general election on septemberxc2xa029 was also disrupted though more than 80 of voters made it to polling stations{27]two deaths were reported in the gulf of saint lawrence off the remote anticosti island in quebec they were fishermen from new brunswick operating near anticosti island{2]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane nameshalifax waterfront after hurricane juanin the hours following the storm a state of emergency was declared in halifax regional municipality and parts of neighbouring east hants municipal district and colchester county the government of nova scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 canadian forces personnel to assist local authorities in hrm with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration{28] many utility workers especially those employed by nova scotia power and the dozens of crews from maritime electric and nb power who responded under mutual assistance agreements worked for almost threexc2xa0weeks without any considerable amount of rest{2] many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring the extensive damagethe devastated point pleasant park remained closed for cleanup after the storm before re-opening in june 2004 nine months after the storm hit with a damaged shoreline and almost 85 of its trees removed a revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005{29]the government of nova scotia pledged 10xc2xa0million (2003 cad) in relief money after the hurricane hit and private contributions were also made quickly after the storm hit{30] prince edward island also pledged 200000 (2003 cad) immediately after the hurricane hit{31] and the federal government also announced their own package{32] the mayor of toronto at the time mel lastman also contributed 50000 (2003 cad) to replace damaged trees in prince edward island{33]hurricane juan alerted residents governments utilities and emergency management agencies throughout atlantic canada to improve preparations for devastating events such as hurricanes especially with climatological data pointing to possible increased frequency of major ocean storms and extratropical cyclones in addition to juan three other stormsxc2xa0xe2x80x94 fabian isabel and katexc2xa0xe2x80x94 had a significant effect on land or offshore in canada during the 2003 atlantic hurricane season{34]preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when hurricane ophelia was forecast to brush near nova scotia in early september 2005{35] hurricane juan has also resulted in several changes to the meteorological service of canada's canadian hurricane centre which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in dartmouth nova scotia to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage chc's hurricane warning system has also been improved; traditionally chc did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings which were often not heeded by local residents beginning in the 2004 atlantic hurricane season chc began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting canada{36] canada issued its first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of hurricane kyle and in 2009 issued its second hurricane watch in anticipation of hurricane billhurricane juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck nova scotia and prince edward island a few months later in february 2004 which quickly became known as white juan because the paralyzing effects of the massive snowfall evoked the recent hurricaneretirement{edit]because of its effects in canada the name juan was retired in april 2004 and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane environment canada noted that its request for retirement was "in consideration of the lost and damaged lives the impact to economy and the widespread destruction of trees throughout two provinces"{37] it was the first time that the meteorological service of canada had specifically requested a hurricane name be retired{38] the name was replaced by joaquin for the 2009 season but since it was not used during that year it was used in the 2015 season although it was later retiredsee also{edit]tropical cyclones portallist of atlantic hurricanesother storms of the same namelist of retired atlantic hurricane nameshurricane arthur (2014)timeline of the 2003 atlantic hurricane seasonlist of storms in the 2003 atlantic hurricane seasonreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k lixion avila (2004-05-12) "hurricane juan tropical cyclone report" (pdf) national hurricane center retrieved may 22 2015xc2xa0^ a b c d e f g h i j chris fogarty (2003) "hurricane juan storm summary" (pdf) canadian hurricane centre environment canada retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ a b peter bowyer (2003) "hurricane juan 2003 storm summary" environment canada retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ lixion avila (2003-09-17) "september 17 tropical weather outlook" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ lixion avila (2003-09-23) "september 23 tropical weather outlook" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ lixion avila (2003-09-25) "tropical depression fifteen discussion fifteen" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ lixion avila (2003-09-25) "tropical storm juan discussion two" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ stacy stewart (2003-09-26) "tropical storm juan discussion four" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ lixion avila (2003-09-27) "hurricane juan discussion ten" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ richard pasch (2003-09-28) "hurricane juan discussion fourteen" national hurricane center retrieved 2011-02-21xc2xa0^ parkes (2003) "canadian hurricane centre information statement 1200 utc september 26" environment canada retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ parkes (2003) "canadian hurricane centre information statement 1800 utc september 27" environment canada retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ parkes (2003) "canadian hurricane centre information statement 0600 utc september 28" environment canada archived from the original on 2012-01-11 retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ parkes (2003) "canadian hurricane centre information statement 1800 utc september 28" environment canada archived from the original on 2012-01-11 retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ richer shawna (2003) "building collapses as juan ravages nova scotia" the globe and mail archived from the original on 2007-09-29 retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ associated press (2003-09-29) "hurricane juan bears down on nova scotia" the boston globe retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ peter bowyer (2003) "classifying hurricane juan" environment canada retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ a b peter bowyer (2003) "the storm surge and waves at halifax with hurricane juan" environment canada retrieved 2006-11-20xc2xa0^ "rainfall amounts from hurricane juan" environment canada 2003 retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ "climate smart: be cool reduce global warming pollution and climate risks" halifax regional municipality 2003 archived from the original on 2013-12-26 retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ associated press (2003-09-30) "juan hits canada's eastern coast" usa today retrieved 2006-12-23xc2xa0^ archived^ murray brewster (2004) "why did juan hit so hard?"
