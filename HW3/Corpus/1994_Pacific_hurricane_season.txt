pacific hurricane season was the final season of the eastern north pacific's most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981 the season officially started on may 15 1994 in the eastern pacific and on june 1 1994 in the central pacific and lasted until november 30 1994 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the first tropical cyclone formed on june 18 while the last system dissipated on october 26{1] this season twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanesof note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms hurricanes emilia gilma john and olivia all reached a pressure below 930xc2xa0millibars longevity-wise no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john which lasted 31 days elsewhere hurricane rosa caused four casualties in mexico as the basin's lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane and later was responsible for flooding in texascontents1

cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline all but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes in the eastern pacific region (140xc2xb0w to north america) nineteen tropical depressions formed of which seventeen became tropical storms nine further intensifying into hurricanes and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of categoryxc2xa03 intensity or higher on the saffir simpson scale{1] these numbers are slightly above the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes{2]in the central pacific hurricane center's area of responsibility (140xc2xb0w to the international date line) three depressions two tropical storms and one hurricane formed overall there were eleven tropical cyclones eight tropical storms five hurricanes and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the central pacific region{3] these numbers are well above the long-term average of four tropical cyclones two hurricanes one tropical storm and two depressions{4] the exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an el nixc3xb1o ongoing at the time{5]the only named storm to make landfall this year was hurricane rosa{1] which killed four people in western mexico{6] and forced over 400 to be evacuated{7] other notable storms include hurricane olivia a high-end category 4 system{1] the three categoryxc2xa05 hurricanes emilia gilma and john both john and hurricane li existed in two of the three basins (east and west) of the pacific ocean{8]this season marked the end of the northeastern pacific's most recent active period which began in 1982{9] and includes the five most active pacific hurricane seasons{1]{9] beginning in 1995 multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity{10] since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal;{11] the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997 where a strong el nino event was observed{9]the 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached categoryxc2xa05 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{8] setting a record later tied in 2002{1] hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history{12] eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central pacific a record shared with the 1992 season until the 2015 season broke the record{5] finally of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific three of them occurred this season{3]the season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e on june 18 and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26{1] no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in november{1] the total length of the season from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last was 130 days{13]accumulated cyclone

windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours summing the results and dividing that total by 104 as a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm tropical depressions are not included in these tables for all storms ace is given to three significant figures the ace in the east pacific proper (140xc2xb0w to north america) is given; the ace in the central pacific (the international date line to 140xc2xb0w) is given in brackets the table includes the ace for li and john only during those storm's time east of the dateline their ace west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1994 typhoon seasonthe national hurricane center uses ace to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal near-normal and below-normal it defines below-normal as having an ace less than 95104xc2xa0kt2 kt2; it defines above normal as having an ace above 150104xc2xa0kt2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average: tropical storms (15) hurricanes (9) or major hurricanes (4); it defines near-normal as having an ace between 100104xc2xa0kt2 and 150104xc2xa0kt2 or an ace above 150104xc2xa0kt2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average: tropical storms (15) hurricanes (9) or major hurricanes (4){2]this season has a total of seventeen tropical storms nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes the
