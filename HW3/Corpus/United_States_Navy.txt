history of the united states navyorigins{edit]it follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honorable and gloriousxe2x80x94xe2x80x89george washington{18]the navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders{19] in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the world's preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775 the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships; this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the us navy{20] the continental navy achieved mixed results; it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels{21] and at one point was reduced to two in active service{22] in august 1785 after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy{23]{24]in 1972 the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to celebrate its birthday on 13 october to honor the establishment of the continental navy in 1775{25]{20]from re-establishment to the civil war{edit]uss constellation vs l'insurgente during the quasi-warthe united states was without a navy for nearly a decade a state of affairs that exposed us maritime merchant ships to a series of attacks by the barbary pirates the sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the us navy's first warships in 1797 was the us revenue cutter service (usrcs) the primary predecessor of the us coast guard although the usrcs conducted operations against the pirates their depredations far outstripped its abilities and congress passed the naval act of 1794 that established a permanent standing navy on 27 march 1794{26] the naval act ordered the construction and manning of six frigates and by october 1797{21] the first three were brought into service: ussxc2xa0united states ussxc2xa0constellation and ussxc2xa0constitution due to his strong posture on having a strong standing navy during this period john adams is "often called the father of the american navy"{27] in 1798xe2x80x9399 the navy was involved in an undeclared quasi-war with france{28] from 1801 to 1805 in the first barbary war the us navy defended us ships from the barbary pirates blockaded the barbary ports and executed attacks against the barbary' fleetsthe us navy saw substantial action in the war of 1812 where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the us navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops{29] after the war the us navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending squadrons to the caribbean the mediterranean where it participated in the second barbary war that ended piracy in the region south america africa and the pacific{21] from 1819 to the outbreak of the civil war the africa squadron operated to suppress the slave trade seizing 36 slave ships although its contribution was smaller than that of the much larger british royal navy{citation needed]uss constitution vs hms guerriere during the war of 1812during the mexicanxe2x80x93american war the us navy blockaded mexican ports capturing or burning the mexican fleet in the gulf of california and capturing all major cities in baja california peninsula in 1846xe2x80x931848 the navy successfully used the pacific squadron under commodore robert stockton and its marines and blue-jackets to facilitate the capture of california with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the california battalion the navy conducted the us military's first large-scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12000 army troops with their equipment in one day at veracruz mexico when larger guns were needed to bombard veracruz navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city this successful landing and capture of veracruz opened the way for the capture of mexico city and the end of the war{29] the us navy established itself as a player in united states foreign policy through the actions of commodore matthew perry in japan which resulted in the convention of kanagawa in 1854{citation needed]naval power played a significant role during the american civil war in which the union had a distinct advantage over the confederacy on the seas{29] a union blockade on all major ports shut down exports and the coastal trade but blockade runners (mostly owned and operated by british companies) provided a thin lifeline the brown-water navy's control of the river systems made internal travel difficult for confederates and easy for the union the war saw ironclad warships in combat for the first time at the battle of hampton roads in 1862 which pitted ussxc2xa0monitor against cssxc2xa0virginia{30] for two decades after the war however the us navy's fleet was neglected and became technologically obsolete{citation needed]20th

modernization program beginning in the 1880s when the first steel hulled warships stimulated the american steel industry and "the new steel navy" was born{31] this rapid expansion of the us navy and its easy victory over the spanish navy in 1898 brought a new respect for american technical quality rapid building of at first pre-dreadnoughts then dreadnoughts brought the us in line with the navies of countries such as britain and germany in 1907 most of the navy's battleships with several support vessels dubbed the great white fleet were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world ordered by president theodore roosevelt it was a mission designed to demonstrate the navy's capability to extend to the global theater{21] by 1911 the us had begun building the super-dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with britain{32]columbia personification of the united states wearing a warship bearing the words "world power" as her "easter bonnet" on the cover of puck 6 april 1901world war i and interwar years{edit]the us navy saw little action during world war i it concentrated on mine laying operations against german u-boats hesitation by the senior command meant that naval forces were not contributed until late 1917 battleship division nine was dispatched to britain and served as the sixth battle squadron of the british grand fleet its presence allowed the british to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels destroyers and us naval air force units contributed to the anti-submarine operations the strength of the united states navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the naval act of 1916{citation needed]naval construction especially of battleships was limited by the washington naval conference of 1921xe2x80x9322 the aircraft carriers ussxc2xa0saratogaxc2xa0(cv-3) and ussxc2xa0lexingtonxc2xa0(cv-2) were built on the hulls of partially built battle cruisers that had been canceled by the treaty

the us navy possessed a carrier fleet of 165000 tonnes displacement although this figure was nominally recorded as 135000 tonnes to comply with treaty limitations franklin roosevelt the number two official in the navy department during world war i appreciated the navy and gave it strong support in return senior leaders were eager for innovation and experimented with new technologies such as magnetic torpedoes and developed a strategy called war plan orange for victory in the pacific in a hypothetical war with japan that would eventually become reality{33]world war ii{edit]main article: united states navy in world war iithe battleship ussxc2xa0idaho shells okinawa on 1 april 1945the us navy grew into a formidable force in the years prior to world war ii with battleship production being restarted in 1937 commencing with ussxc2xa0north carolinaxc2xa0(bb-55) though ultimately unsuccessful japan attempted to neutralize this strategic threat with the surprise attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 following american entry into the war the us navy grew tremendously as the united states was faced with a two-front war on the seas it achieved notable acclaim in the pacific theater where it was instrumental to the allies' successful "island hopping" campaign{22] the us navy participated in many significant battles including the battle of the coral sea the battle of midway the solomon islands campaign the battle of the philippine sea the battle of leyte gulf and the battle of okinawa by war's end in 1945 the us navy had added hundreds of new ships including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships and had over 70 of the world's total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1000 tons or greater{34]{35] at its peak the us navy was operating 6768 ships on v-j day in august 1945{36]doctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war the us navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of great britain and germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons{37] the development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the japanese against the us at pearl harbor however shifted us thinking the pearl harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of us navy battleships this placed much of the burden of retaliating against the japanese on the small number of aircraft carriers{38]cold war{edit]ussxc2xa0george washingtonxc2xa0(ssbn-598) a ballistic missile submarinethe potential for armed conflict with the soviet union during the cold war pushed the us navy to continue its technological advancement by developing new weapons systems ships and aircraft us naval strategy changed to that of forward deployment in support of us allies with an emphasis on carrier battle groups{39]the navy was a major participant in the vietnam war blockaded cuba during the cuban missile crisis and through the use of ballistic missile submarines became an important aspect of the united states' nuclear strategic deterrence policy the us navy conducted various combat operations in the persian gulf against iran in 1987 and 1988 most notably operation praying mantis the navy was extensively involved in operation urgent fury operation desert shield operation desert storm operation deliberate force operation allied force operation desert fox and operation southern watch{citation needed]the us navy has also been involved in search and rescuesearch and salvage operations sometimes in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with us coast guard ships two examples are the 1966 palomares b-52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs and task force 71 of the seventh fleet operation in search for korean air lines flight 007 shot down by the soviets on 1 september 1983{citation needed]21st century{edit]when a crisis confronts the nation the first question often asked by policymakers is: 'what naval forces are available and how fast can they be on station?'xe2x80x94xe2x80x89admiral carlisle a h trost{40]the us navy continues to be a major support to us interests in the 21st century since the end of the cold war it has shifted its focus from preparations for large-scale war with the soviet union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts{41] the navy participated in operation enduring freedom operation iraqi freedom and is a major participant in the ongoing war on terror largely in this capacity development continues on new ships and weapons including the gerald r ford-class aircraft carrier and the littoral combat ship because of its size weapons technology and ability to project force far from us shores the current us navy remains a potent asset for the united states moreover it is the principal means through which the us maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations{42]in 2007 the us navy joined with the us marine corps and us coast guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called a cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war the strategy was presented by the chief of naval operations the commandant of the marine corps and commandant of the coast guard at the international sea power symposium in newport ri on 17 october 2007{43] the strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crisesxe2x80x94man-made or naturalxe2x80x94can adversely impact the us economy and quality of life this new strategy charts a course for the navy coast guard and marine corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the us{citation needed]in 2010 chief of naval operations admiral gary roughead noted that demands on the navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future the us navy must rely even more on international partnerships{44]in its 2013 budget request the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the ssbn replacement{45] by the next year the usn found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the bipartisan budget act of 2013 and cno jonathan greenert said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements{46] the british first sea lord george zambellas said that {47] the usn had switched from "outcome-led to resource-led" planning{48]one significant change in us policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the pivot to east asia in response this secretary of the navy ray mabus has stated that 60 percent of the total us fleet will be deployed to the pacific by the year 2020{49] the navy's most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan published in 2016 calls for a future fleet of 350 ships in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environment{47]us navy officers aboard the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln (cvn-72) monitor defense systems during early 2010s maritime security operations exercisesthe uss america amphibious

us navy falls under the administration of the department of the navy under civilian leadership of the secretary of the navy (secnav) the most senior naval officer is the chief of naval operations (cno) a four-star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the secretary of the navy at the same time the chief of naval operations is one of the joint chiefs of staff which is the second-highest deliberatory body of the armed forces after the united states national security council although it only plays an advisory role to the president and does not nominally form part of the chain of command the secretary of the navy and chief of naval operations are responsible for organizing recruiting training and equipping the navy so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified combat command commanders{citation needed]operating forces{edit]main article: list of units of the united states navythere are nine components in the operating forces of the us navy: the united states fleet forces command (formerly united states atlantic fleet) united states pacific fleet united states naval forces central command united states naval forces europe naval network warfare command navy reserve united states naval special warfare command operational test and evaluation force and military sealift command fleet forces command controls a number of unique

atlantic fleet) pacific fleet naval forces europe-africa and naval forces central command whose commander also doubles as commander fifth fleet; the first three commands being led by four-star admirals the united states first fleet existed after the second world war from 1947 but it was redesignated the third fleet in early 1973 in early 2008 the navy reactivated the united states fourth

marine corps came under the department of the navy{52] historically the navy has had a unique relationship with the usmc partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations together the navy and marine corps form the department of the navy and report to the secretary of the navy however the marine corps is a distinct separate service branch{53] with its own uniformed service chief xe2x80x93 the commandant of the marine corps a four-star general{citation needed]the marine corps depends on the navy for medical support (dentists doctors nurses medical technicians known as corpsmen) and religious support (chaplains) thus navy officers and enlisted sailors fulfill these roles when attached to marine corps units deployed to an operational environment they generally wear marine camouflage uniforms but otherwise they wear navy dress uniforms unless they opt to conform to marine corps grooming standards{citation needed]in the operational environment as an expeditionary force specializing in amphibious operations marines often embark on navy ships to conduct operations from beyond territorial waters marine units deploying as part of a marine air-ground task force (magtf) operate under the command of the existing marine chain of command although marine units routinely operate from amphibious assault ships the relationship has evolved over the years much as the commander of the carrier air groupwing (cag) does not work for the carrier commanding officer but coordinates with the ship's co and staff some marine aviation squadrons usually fixed-wing assigned to carrier air wings train and operate alongside navy squadrons; they fly similar missions and often fly sorties together under the cognizance of the cag aviation is where the navy and marines share the most common ground since aircrews are guided in their use of aircraft by standard procedures outlined in series of publications known as natops manuals{citation needed]united states coast guard{edit]a

peacetime role with the department of homeland security fulfills its law enforcement and rescue role in the maritime environment it provides law enforcement detachments (ledets) to navy vessels where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during naval boarding and interdiction missions in times of war the coast guard operates as a service in the navy{54] at other times coast guard port security units are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets the coast guard also jointly staffs the navy's naval coastal warfare groups and squadrons (the latter of which were known as harbor defense commands until late-2004) which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas{citation needed]personnel{edit]main article: personnel of the united

more than eighty percent are enlisted sailors and around fifteen percent are commissioned officers; the rest are midshipmen of the united states naval academy and midshipmen of the naval reserve officer training corps at over 180 universities around the country and officer candidates at the navy's officer candidate school{2]enlisted sailors complete basic military training at boot camp and then are sent to complete training for their individual careers{55]sailors prove they have mastered skills and deserve responsibilities by completing personnel qualification standards (pqs) tasks and examinations among the most important is the "warfare qualification" which denotes a journeyman level of capability in surface warfare aviation warfare information dominance warfare naval aircrew

of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the united states navy this led to the development of the anspy-1 phased array radar and the standard missile with the aegis combat system coordinating the two ticonderoga-class cruisers were the first to be equipped with aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role later developments of vertical launch systems and the tomahawk missile gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle

the case of destroyers frigates are named after us navy marine corps and coast guard heroes as of autumn 2015 the us navy has retired its most recent class of frigates and expects that by 2020 the littoral combat ships (lcs) will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet the lcs is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone (close to shore) it was "envisioned to be a networked agile stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals" they have the capabilities of a small assault transport including a flight deck and hangar for housing two helicopters a stern ramp for operating small boats and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-onroll-off port facility the ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles including anti-submarine warfare mine countermeasures anti-surface warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance homeland defense maritime intercept special operations and logistics all by swapping mission-specific modules as needed the lcs program is still relatively new as of 2015 with only a

submarines so vital to a modern blue-water navy the us navy operates three types: ballistic missile submarines guided missile submarines and attack submarines us navy (nuclear) ballistic missile submarines carry the stealthiest leg of the us strategic triad (the other legs are the land-based us strategic missile force and the air-based us strategic bomber force) these submarines have only one mission: to carry and if called upon to launch the trident nuclear missile the primary missions of attack and guided missile submarines in the us navy are peacetime engagement surveillance and intelligence special operations precision strikes and control of the seas{86] to these attack submarines also add the battlegroup operations mission attack and guided missile submarines have several tactical missions including sinking ships and other subs launching cruise missiles gathering intelligence and assisting in special operations{citation needed]as with other classes of naval vessels most us submarines (or "boats") are named according to specific conventions the boats of the current us ballistic missile submarine class ohio-class are named after us states as the four current us

attack on pearl harbor the battle of the coral sea and the battle of midway that aircraft carriers and the planes that they carried had replaced the battleship as the greatest weapon on the seas leading navy aircraft in world war ii included the grumman f4f wildcat the grumman f6f hellcat the chance vought f4u corsair the douglas sbd dauntless and the grumman tbf avenger navy aircraft also played a significant role in conflicts during the following cold war years with the f-4 phantom ii and the f-14 tomcat becoming military icons of the era the navy's current primary fighter and attack airplanes are the multi-mission fa-18cd hornet and its newer cousin the fa-18ef super hornet the f-35 lightning ii is presently under development and was scheduled to replace the c and d versions of the hornet beginning in 2012{88] initial operational capability of the f-35c is now expected to be february 2019{89] the navy is also looking to eventually replace its fa-18ef super hornets with the

offensive role missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision because they are unmanned weapons missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots land strikes are the domain of the bgm-109 tomahawk which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities for anti-ship strikes the navy's dedicated missile is the harpoon missile to defend against enemy missile attack the navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the aegis combat system medium-long range defense is provided by the standard missile 2 which has been deployed since the 1980s the standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti-aircraft weapon and is undergoing development for use in theater ballistic missile defense short range defense against missiles is provided by the phalanx ciws and the more recently developed rim-162 evolved sea sparrow missile in addition to missiles the navy employs mark 46 and mark 50 torpedoes and various types of naval mines{citation needed]aviation ordnancemen loading gbu-12 bombs in 2005naval fixed-wing aircraft employ much of the same
