of china development and design falls under the auspices of the china academy of launch vehicle technology in english the rockets are abbreviated as lm- for export and cz- within china as "chang zheng" means "long march" in chinese pinyin the rockets are named after the long march of chinese communist historycontents1 history2 payloads3 propellants4 variants41 long march 842 long march 943

launcheschina launched its first satellite known as dong fang hong 1 (lit "the east is red 1") into earth orbit on its long march space rocket on april 24 1970 becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability early launches had an inconsistent record focusing on launching of chinese satellitesstarting in 1990 the long march rocket entered the international market however several setbacks occurred during the early 1990s on january 26 1995 a long march 2e rocket veered off course two seconds after take-off from xichang space center and exploded killing at least six on the ground{citation needed] on february 14 1996 a similar failure occurred during the launch of intelsat 708: the rocket veered severely off course immediately after clearing the launch tower and crashed into a village{1]following the disaster foreign media were sequestered in a bunker for five hours while some have alleged the chinese military attempted to 'clean up' the damage{citation needed] officials later blamed the failure on an "unexpected gust of wind"{2] xinhua news agency initially reported 6 deaths and 57 injuries{3]in the aftermath of the explosion us satellite makers shared information that allowed the chinese to determine that the problem was in the welds{4] this sharing of information was later deemed illegal by the united states and us satellite maker loral space and communications was fined 14 million by the us government{5]for thirteen years starting in august 1996 75 consecutive successful launches were conducted including multiple milestones:on october 15 2003 the long march 2f rocket successfully launched the shenzhou 5 spacecraftorbiter carrying china's first astronaut into space; china thus became the third nation to send a person in space independently after the soviet unionrussia and the united stateson october 12 2005 long march 2f launched the shenzhou 6 with two astronautson june 1 2007 long march rockets completed their 100th launch overallon october 24 2007 the long march 3a successfully launched (18:05 gmt+8) the "chang'e 1" lunar orbiting spacecraft from the xichang satellite launch centeron september 25 2008 a long march 2f launched shenzhou 7 china's first three-man mission and first eva missionthe string of successful launches ended on august 31 2009 when the launch of palapa-d partially failed due to a third stage malfunction{6]on the june 11 2013 a long march 2f launched from the jiuquan satellite launch center putting three astronauts into orbit for the shenzhou 10 mission{7]as of march 2016{update] there have been 225 long march missions{8]payloads{edit]the long march is china's primary expendable launch system family the shenzhou spacecraft and chang'e lunar orbiters are also launched on the long march rocket the maximum payload for leo is 12000 kilograms (cz-3b) the maximum payload for gto is 5500xc2xa0kg (cz-3be) the next generation rocketxc2xa0xe2x80x93 long march 5 variants will offer more payload in the futurepropellants{edit]long march 1's 1st and 2nd stage uses nitric acid and udmh propellants and its upper stage uses a spin-stabilized solid rocket enginelong march 2 long march 3 long march 4 the main stages and associated liquid rocket boosters use dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizing agent and udmh as the fuel the upper stages (third stage) of long march 3 rockets use yf-73 and yf-75 engines using liquid hydrogen (lh2) as the fuel and liquid oxygen (lox) as the oxidizerthe new generation of long march rocket family long march 5 and its derivations long march 6 long march 7 will use lox and kerosene as core stage and liquid booster propellant with lox and lh2 in upper stagesvariants{edit]timeline of long march rocket familiesthe long

or changzheng 9 chinese: xe9x95xbfxe5xbex81xe4xb9x9dxe5x8fxb7) is a chinese super-heavy carrier rocket that is currently in study it is planned for a maximum payload capacity of at least 140000xc2xa0kg{19] to leo or at least 50000xc2xa0kg to lunar transfer orbit{20] its first flight is expected in 2025 in preparation for a lunar landing sometime in the 2030s it has been stated that around 70 of the hardware and components needed for a test flight are currently undergoing testing with the first engine test to occur by the end of 2018 the proposed design would be a three-staged rocket with the initial core having a diameter of 10 meters and use a cluster of four engines multiple variants on the rocket have been proposed cz-9 being the largest with four liquid-fuel boosters with the aforementioned leo payload capacity of 140000xc2xa0kg cz-9a having just two boosters and a leo payload capacity of 100000xc2xa0kg and finally cz-9b having just the core stage and a leo payload capacity of 50000xc2xa0kg{16] if produced it would be classified as a super heavy-lift launch vehicle along with the american saturn v and unsuccessful soviet n1; and the space launch system and falcon heavy currently under development in the united stateslong march 11{edit]the long march 11 is a solid-fuel rocket that applies china's largest solid-fuel rocket engine and was designed to meet the need to rapidly launch satellites in case of emergencies or disasters its first launch on 25 september 2015 was reported to be successful and launched 4 micro satellites into sun-synchronous orbits{21]{22]origins{edit]the long march 1 rocket is derived from earlier chinese 2-stage irbm df-4 or dong feng 4 missile and long march 2 long march 3 long march 4 rocket families are derivatives of the chinese 2-stage icbms df-5 or dong feng 5 missile however like its counterparts in both the united states and in russia the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge the main goal of a space rocket is to maximize payload while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a first strike this divergence has become clear in the next generation of long march rockets which use cryogenic propellants in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles which are mobile and solid fuelledthe next generation of long march rocket long march 5 rocket family will be a brand new design while long march 6 and long march 7 can be seen as derivations because they use the liquid rocket booster design of long march 5 to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicleslaunch sites{edit]there are four launch centers in china they are:jiuquan satellite launch centertaiyuan satellite launch centerwenchang satellite launch centerxichang satellite launch centermost of the commercial satellite launches of long march vehicles have been from xichang satellite launch center located in xichang sichuan province wenchang satellite launch center in hainan province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches long march launches also take place from the more military oriented jiuquan satellite launch center in gansu province from which the manned shenzhou spacecraft also launches taiyuan satellite launch center is located in shanxi province and focuses on the launches of sun-synchronous orbit satellitescommercial launch services{edit]china markets launch services under the china great wall industry corporation{23] its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the united states stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help china's military in the face of this thales alenia space built the chinasat-6b satellite with no components from the united states whatsoever this allowed it to be launched on a chinese launch vehicle without violating us itar restrictions{24] the launch on a long march 3b rocket was successfully conducted on july 5 2007 a chinese long march 2d launched venezuela's vrss-1 (venezuelan remote sensing satellite 1) "francisco de miranda" on september 29 2012see also{edit]spaceflight portalchina
