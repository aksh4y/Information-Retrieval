third-strongest november atlantic hurricane on record it was the sixteenth tropical storm eighth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season a late season hurricane it set several records for its intensity and formation paloma was the third most powerful november hurricane on record in the atlantic basin behind only a 1932 hurricane and 1999's lenny it also marked the first time that at least one major hurricane formed in every month of the hurricane season from july to november with only june not having a major hurricane this seasonpaloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern coast of nicaragua and northern coast of honduras on november 5 the disturbance had slowly developed into a tropical depression while hugging the coastline the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on november 6 then a hurricane later that day the next day paloma intensified into a category 2 hurricane then soon a category 3 early on november 8 paloma continued to intensify and reached category 4 intensity and then weakened rapidly into a category 2 before making landfall in santa cruz del sur cuba paloma weakened into a tropical storm on november 9 while moving over cuba where it stalled out it dissipated later that evening hurricane paloma caused heavy damage in both the cayman islands and cuba damages in the caymans amounted to 1544xc2xa0million (usd) and damage in cuba totaled to 300xc2xa0million and 100000 in damage to jamaica for a total of 4545 million with one fatalitycontents1 meteorological history2

linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalein early novemberxc2xa02008 an area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern caribbean sea{1] by novemberxc2xa02 a surface trough manifested itself spurring the development of scattered convectionxc2xa0xe2x80x94 shower and thunderstorm activityxc2xa0xe2x80x94 across the region{2] a tropical wave approaching from the east interacted with this trough two days later and enhanced convective organization{3] steadily consolidating the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa05 while located 130xc2xa0mi (215xc2xa0km) southeast of the nicaraguahonduras border situated along the southwestern edge of a ridge the depressed initially generally to the north-northwest before turning north-northeast within 12xc2xa0hours of formation favorable environmental conditions including low wind shear allowed for steady intensification following cyclogenesis{1] the hwrf and gfdl forecast models depicted rapid development of the depression into a major hurricane within five days before striking cuba{4] the former of which indicated a peak intensity of 131xc2xa0mph (211xc2xa0kmh) and 921xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2720xc2xa0inhg){5] the system acquired gale-force winds early on novemberxc2xa06 at which time it was assigned the name paloma{1] aided by good upper-level outflow deep convection blossomed over the storm's circulation{5] further development of banding features and eye resulted in paloma rapidly intensifying into a hurricane by 00:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa07{1]{6]{7]infrared satellite image of hurricane paloma at 10:08xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa08 shortly before peak intensitythe initial phase of rapid intensification temporarily abated on novemberxc2xa07 though slow strengthening continued once its eye became defined on visible satellite imagery that evening rapid strengthening ensued once more{1]{8] a localized area of high ocean heat content bolstered this phase{9] aided by increasing divergence from an approaching upper-level trough paloma's outflow greatly enhanced overnight{1] the aforementioned trough imparted a slightly more northeasterly track on the hurricane{10] around 09:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa08 the hurricane skirted little cayman as a categoryxc2xa03{11] rapid intensification continued through the first half of the day with paloma reaching categoryxc2xa04 on the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale around 10:30xc2xa0utc{12] the first such november system since hurricane michelle in 2001{1] around this time the storm's center passed over cayman brac and little cayman shortly thereafter{13] an unofficial anemometer on cayman brac at an elevation of 240xc2xa0ft (73xc2xa0m) measured sustained winds of 151xc2xa0mph (243xc2xa0kmh) based on data from reconnaissance aircraft which found flight-level winds 163xc2xa0mph (262xc2xa0kmh) paloma peaked with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 145xc2xa0mph (230xc2xa0kmh) at 12:00xe2x80x9318:00xc2xa0utc along with a minimum barometric pressure of 944xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2788xc2xa0inhg){1] this ranked the system as the third-strongest november hurricane on record only behind the 1932 santa cruz del sur hurricane and hurricane lenny in 1999{14] additionally this marked the first time that major hurricanes developed in five separate months during a single year with bertha gustav ike and omar reaching this strength in july august september and october respectively at its peak paloma displayed a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection estimated at xe2x88x9270 to xe2x88x9280xc2xa0xc2xb0c (xe2x88x9294 to xe2x88x92112xc2xa0xc2xb0f){9]late on novemberxc2xa08 environmental conditions abruptly became hostile as the hurricane approached cuba interaction with land hastened paloma's weakening with convection diminishing significantly the northern eyewall moved ashore around 23:00xc2xa0utc while the center itself made landfall at 01:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa09 near santa cruz del sur upon moving ashore paloma was estimated to have had winds of 100xc2xa0mph (155xc2xa0kmh) making it a categoryxc2xa02{1] within hours of moving ashore the center decoupled from the remaining convection and its forward speed slowed significantly{15] the system subsequently degraded to a tropical depression by 18:00xc2xa0utc just 24xc2xa0hours after being a categoryxc2xa04 with no convection redeveloping as the system drifted northward over cuba paloma degenerated into a remnant low six hours later the low then briefly moved over the atlantic ocean before doubling back to the southwest in response to a building ridge farther north the system crossed cuba again and re-emerged over the caribbean sea by novemberxc2xa012 changing direction this time to the west and later northwest after crossing western cuba early on novemberxc2xa013 the remnants of paloma entered the gulf of mexico accelerating northward the low became decreasingly organized and ultimately dissipated early the next day about 70xc2xa0mi (110xc2xa0km) south-southwest of apalachicola florida{1] later on novemberxc2xa014 the system moved inland over the florida panhandle where a sudden burst of convective development akin to that of supercell thunderstorms over the great plains took place thereafter energy from paloma may have contributed to a deadly tornado outbreak in the carolinas on novemberxc2xa015{16]preparations{edit]cayman islands{edit]infrared satellite image of hurricane paloma at 11:09xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa07 as it approached the cayman islandsat 15:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa06 the government of the cayman islands issued a hurricane watch for all of the territory's islands this was superseded six hours later by a hurricane warning the warning was eventually discontinued early on novemberxc2xa09 once paloma cleared the islands{1] on novemberxc2xa07 the red cross opened a shelter for possible evacuees while stocks of emergency supplies were checked{17] schools businesses and government offices closed for novemberxc2xa08{18] shelters opened on grand cayman closed their doors by mid-afternoon in advance of paloma's arrival to "ensure that persons get off the roads"{19] at least 40xc2xa0people sought refuge in these shelters prior to the storm's arrival{20] the seamanxe2x80x99s center a government office building was utilized as an unofficial shelter during the storm and housed at least 100xc2xa0people{13] the cayman islands government requested all hotels to move guests on ground and first floors to higher rooms as a precautionary measure water service was turned off during the evening on novemberxc2xa08 the british ship rfa wave ruler was sent to little cayman and cayman brac for humanitarian assistance on the order of governor stuart jack{20]cuba{edit]the nhc's forecast track of hurricane paloma and associated watcheswarnings at 15:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa08anticipating hurricane conditions to impact portions of eastern cuba the nation's government issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of camagxc3xbcey ciego de xc3x81vila granma las tunas and sancti spxc3xadritus at 12:00xc2xa0utc on novemberxc2xa07 six hours later this was upgraded to a hurricane warning except and by the novemberxc2xa08 warnings covered the entirety of eastern cuba these advisories were discontinued following paloma's rapid dissipation over land on novemberxc2xa09{1]fearing a "potentially catastrophic" storm with a storm surge of 20 to 25xc2xa0ft (61 to 76xc2xa0m) officials in cuba scrambled to evacuate nearly half a million people in southern areas of the country{21] coincidentally paloma threatened the same area where a devastating hurricane in 1932 killed more than 3000xc2xa0people almost exactly 76xc2xa0years prior{22] plans were put in place to evacuate 345000 in holguxc3xadn 324000 in granma 250000xc2xa0people in las tunas and 200000 in camagxc3xbcey{21]{23]{24] an estimated 3000xc2xa0tourists in ciego de avila were brought to shelters{21] ultimately an approximate 12xc2xa0million people 107 of cuba's entire population were relocated in advance of the storm's arrival of these people 220000xc2xa0sought refuge in 1448xc2xa0shelters while the rest stayed with relatives a total of 927xc2xa0food processing centers and 72xc2xa0soup kitchens opened to feed evacuees roughly 237000xc2xa0animals were moved to safer areas{25] holguxc3xadn province was devastated by hurricane ike in september with many residents still homeless at the time of paloma's approach{26] all domestic flights except those around the isle of youth{22] former president fidel castro urged people to remain positive in the face of yet another hurricane that year{27] he also issued a written statement to the united states rejecting any aid citing anger toward the ongoing embargo of cuba before a formal offer was even made{28] the non-profit organization operation usa provided emergency aid to cuba{29]elsewhere{edit]following the classification of tropical depression seventeen late on novemberxc2xa05 a tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas between puerto cabezas nicaragua and limon honduras this later expired on novemberxc2xa06 as paloma moved away from the region{1] owing to the threat of heavy rains in honduras a red alert was issued for colxc3xb3n gracias a dios northern olancho and the bay islands{30]although paloma was not forecast to directly impact jamaica officials opened 15 priority shelters in st james and all agencies were placed under high-alert on novemberxc2xa08{31] a flash flood warning was in place from novemberxc2xa06xe2x80x939 for the entire island{32]early on novemberxc2xa08 a tropical storm watch and later tropical storm warning was issued for the central bahamas{1] including cat island exuma long island rum cay san salvador crooked island acklins and ragged island accordingly the national emergency operations centre was partially activated{33] the warning was allowed to expire the following day as paloma rapidly weakened over cuba{1] and the national emergency operations centre issued an all clear on novemberxc2xa010{34]impact{edit]honduras and nicaragua{edit]see also: october 2008 central america floodsthroughout much of october central america was plagued by a series of heavy rain events which resulted in widespread damage and loss of life{35] the outer bands of then tropical storm paloma exacerbated the situation in parts of honduras and nicaragua{36] estimates from the tropical rainfall measuring mission satellites indicated that paloma dropped upwards of 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) of rain along coastal areas{37] the overall impacts of flooding since october in honduras left at least 60xc2xa0people dead and more than 300000 in need of assistance{38]cayman islands{edit]a destroyed home on cayman bracpassing directly over the small islands cayman brac and little cayman with a collective population of 2695 hurricane paloma wrought tremendous damage grand cayman escaped almost entirely unscathed throughout the cayman islands paloma was responsible for 1544xc2xa0million in losses of which 1245xc2xa0million was incurred from damage this equates to roughly 74xc2xa0percent of the territory's gross domestic product (gdp) while the overall impact to the islands was offset by a lack of damage on grand cayman the localized losses on cayman brac and little cayman were tremendous discounting the economy of grand cayman the equivalent gdp losses on the two smaller islands was likely similar to that of hurricane ivan in 2004 which left damage equal to 183xc2xa0percent of the territory's gdp the overall per capita impact there reached 57925 despite the severity of damage no loss of life or injuries took place{13]destructive winds and torrential rains battered both cayman brac and little cayman with an unofficial elevated observation station reporting maximum sustained winds of 151xc2xa0mph (243xc2xa0kmh) during the height of the storm grand cayman saw lesser winds with a peak sustained observation of 60xc2xa0mph (97xc2xa0kmh) at owen roberts international airport precipitation on cayman brac amounted to 1777xc2xa0in (451xc2xa0mm) and 605xc2xa0in (154xc2xa0mm) on grand cayman a significant storm surge also impacted the islands reaching 8xc2xa0ft (24xc2xa0m) on cayman brac and 4xc2xa0ft (12xc2xa0m) on little cayman{1]destructive winds were the primary cause of damage across cayman brac and little cayman where nearly all homes were affected cayman brac sustained the most severe impact with 71xc2xa0homes destroyed and 912xc2xa0damaged although all home on little cayman were affected none experienced major damage bodden town was the only district on grand cayman reporting damage with 11xc2xa0homes affected major damage took place at cayman brac's seaport the port's warehouse and office building were destroyed while anchors and moorings were shifted out of position the island's fire station and faith hospital had major roof damage with the latter resulting in significant water damage to equipment the roof of the seamanxe2x80x99s center later determined to have been inadequately built collapsed during the storm and nearly injured people sheltering within it all schools on cayman brac suffered moderate to major damage while the primary school on little cayman experienced minor damage{13]the electrical grid sustained major damage with all residents on cayman brac and little cayman losing service roughly 400xc2xa0power poles fell during the storm telecommunications experienced similar damage with landline services disrupted for two to three weeks six of the ten affected digicel sites went down effects on the water supply was negligible with only a few pipes damaged by uprooted trees major crop damage took place on grand cayman primarily to bananas plantains and peppers due to high winds{13]jamaica{edit]flooding was reported in parts of jamaica as a result of the outer bands of paloma one person drowned in clarendon parish while crossing a flooded river{39]{40] severe flooding also destroyed crops in 100 farms causing over 100000 in damages{41] in st catherine several inches of rain caused flooding in bog walk gorge which inundated several homes and stranded at least 15 people numerous vehicles were washed away in the floods{42]cuba{edit]radar loop of hurricane paloma from peak intensity to landfall in cubahurricane paloma was the final tropical cyclone to impact cuba during the destructive 2008xc2xa0season preceded by fay gustav hanna and ike paloma compounded damage sustained by the nation the 2008 season is regarded as the most destructive in cuban history primarily due to the effects of gustav and ike{43] total damage from hurricanes that year amounted to 94xc2xa0billion{44]cuban utility officials say paloma's effect on the power grid was not as bad as the destruction caused by gustav and ike earlier in the season{45] paloma did however knock down power and telephone lines as well as a major communications tower the hurricane brought with it a 14-foot (4 meter) storm surge which moved the coastline inland by almost a mile (about 15xc2xa0km) in santa cruz del sur doing extensive damage{46]in santa cruz del sur where paloma came ashore 435 homes were torn to shreds the sea swept more than a mile inland the wind and waves left wooden houses in splinters topped with seaweed two of the two-story concrete walls of a factory crumbled into piles of rubble smashing 57 wooden fishing boats stored inside for safekeeping{47] an estimated 328 hectares of crops were destroyed by the storm most of which were in the process of recovery following hurricane ike a total of 8000 homes in santa cruz were damaged and another 670 in camaguey and las tunas about 7000 farmers and 4700 residences were isolated by floodwaters{48] overall damages in cuba totaled to 300 million{44]florida{edit]infrared satellite image of the remnant of paloma over the florida panhandleafter tracking through the gulf of mexico the remnants of paloma reached the florida panhandle on novemberxc2xa014{1] shortly before crossing the coastline convection suddenly and explosively developed contributing to a swath of heavy rains the highest amount was recorded in bloxham at 925 inches (235xc2xa0mm) which contributed to flash flooding unofficial radar observations indicated rainfall totals up to 14 inches (360xc2xa0mm) the torrential rains marked the highest rainfall for novemberxc2xa014 in the state of florida{16] flood waters south of tallahassee reached 2 feet (061xc2xa0m) in places stranding vehicles one person was trapped by flood waters but was rescued without injury{49]aftermath{edit]see also: list of retired atlantic hurricane namesowing to the hurricane's destructive effects in the cayman islands and cuba the world meteorological organization retired the name paloma in the spring of 2009 and replaced it with paulette the name will never again be used for another atlantic hurricane{50]cayman islands{edit]local groups in the cayman islands set up funds following hurricane paloma by marchxc2xa03 2009 one group raised 120000 in relief funds and received another 20000 in donations{51] following the storm the british red cross released xc2xa315000 (us23500) in emergency funds the government of the cayman islands and the adventist disaster response agency distributed basic relief items such as tarpaulins hygiene items and buckets to victims of the storm{52]the overall impacts from hurricane paloma were reflected in the territory's gdp by a 09xc2xa0percent decrease worth 33xc2xa0million in the expected growth for 2008 total revenue fell by 116xc2xa0million while expenditures rose by 282xc2xa0million{nb 1] strain on the economy prompted inflation to rise slightly above 52xc2xa0percent for the year as well{13]between novemberxc2xa018 and decemberxc2xa013 675xc2xa0tons of debris was collected which covered an area of 21xc2xa0acres by 12xc2xa0ft (37xc2xa0m) tall{13]cuba{edit]already severely impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike the european commission through its humanitarian aid department was already providing xe2x82xac2 million (us27xc2xa0million) in relief aid{52] by novemberxc2xa021 about 6000 volunteers from the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies were in cuba assisting in cleanup efforts and helping victims in shelters the organization also allocated us88xc2xa0million in relief funds for 60000 people affected by paloma{54]see also{edit]tropical cyclones
