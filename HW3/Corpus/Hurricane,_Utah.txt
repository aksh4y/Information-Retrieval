hurricane canal was the lifeblood of the hurricane valley built over a period of 11 years (1893xe2x80x931904) mostly by pick and shovel the canal stands as a testament to pioneer ingenuity and determination since 1985 the canal has lain empty in 2000 special interest groups came together to preserve the canal receiving grants and volunteering time to construct a trail to stand as a tribute to the sweat and toil early settlers put forth to make the canal a reality a monument at the trailhead recounts the canal story in brief much of the trail which only covers a small section of the canal is the actual west bank of the canal which xe2x80x9ccanal ridersxe2x80x9d rode every day when the canal was in operation to ensure there were no leaks or other problems since the bank was somewhat unstable two of the trailxe2x80x99s unique aspects are walking in the canal itself xe2x80x93 on a steel flume across a wash and through a tunnel immediately thereafter the trail provides excellent views of the towns of hurricane and la verkin throughout the trail ends before reaching the virgin river gorge approximately five miles from the canalxe2x80x99s former headwatersstate route
