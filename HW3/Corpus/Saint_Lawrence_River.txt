drain into the saint lawrencethe saint lawrence river is in a seismically active zone where fault reactivation is believed to occur along late proterozoic to early paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of iapetus ocean the faults in the area are rift related and are called the saint lawrence rift systemaccording to the united states geological survey the saint lawrence valley is a physiographic province of the larger appalachian division containing the champlain and northern physiographic section{7] however in canada where most of the valley is it is instead considered part of a distinct saint lawrence lowlands physiographic division and not part of the appalachian division at all{8]history{edit]map of 1543 showing cartier's discoveriesbasque settlements and sites dating from the 16th and 17th centuriesthough the norse explored the gulf of saint lawrence in the 11th century and were followed by fifteenth and early sixteenth century european mariners such as john cabot the brothers gaspar miguel corte-real and alonso sanchez the first european explorer known to have sailed up the saint lawrence river itself was jacques cartier at that time the land along the river was inhabited by the st lawrence iroquoians; at the time of cartier's second voyage in 1535 because cartier arrived in the estuary on saint lawrence's feast day he named it the gulf of saint lawrence{9] the saint lawrence river is partly within the us and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving european place-name{10]the earliest regular europeans in the area were the basques who came to the st lawrence gulf and river in pursuit of whales from the early 16th century the basque whalers and fishermen traded with indigenous americans and set up settlements leaving vestiges all over the coast of eastern canada and deep into the saint lawrence river basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the armada invencible's disaster (1588) when the spanish basque whaling fleet was confiscated by king philip ii of spain and largely destroyed initially the whaling galleons from labourd were not affected by the spanish defeatuntil the early 17th century the french used the name rivixc3xa8re du canada to designate the saint lawrence upstream to montreal and the ottawa river after montreal the saint lawrence river served as the main route for european exploration of the north american interior first pioneered by french explorer samuel de champlaincontrol of the river was crucial to british strategy to capture new france in the seven years' war having captured louisbourg in 1758 the british sailed up to quebec the following year thanks to charts drawn up by james cook british troops were ferried via the saint lawrence to attack the city from the west which they successfully did at the battle of the plains of abraham the river was used again by the british to defeat the french siege of quebec under the chevalier de lxc3xa9vis in 1760because of the virtually impassable lachine rapids the saint lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as montreal opened in 1825 the lachine canal was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids an extensive system of canals and locks known as the saint lawrence seaway was officially opened on 26 june 1959 by elizabeth ii (representing canada) and president dwight d eisenhower (representing the united states) the seaway now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to lake superiorduring the second world war the battle of the st lawrence involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower saint lawrence river and the entire gulf of saint lawrence strait of belle isle and cabot strait from may to october 1942 september 1943 and again in october and november 1944 during this time german u-boats sank several merchant marine ships and three canadian warshipsin the late 1970s the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called "save the river") originally responding to planned development by the united states army corps of engineers the campaign was organized among others by abbie hoffman{citation needed]resident
