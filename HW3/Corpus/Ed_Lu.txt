deflection the foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope sentinel to be launched in 2017xe2x80x932018 the sentinel's infrared telescope once parked in an orbit similar to that of venus will help identify asteroids and other near-earth objects (neos) that pose a risk of collision with earth{1]magic trick in space{edit]while on the iss lu teamed up with magician james randi (founder of jref) to perform a card trick in outer space randi asked lu to (without looking) select a card from the middle of a brand new freshly shuffled deck of cards turn it around and reinsert the card into the deck the opposite direction then place the deck of cards back into its box then take them out again and fan the cards to the camera this same procedure was being done by randi back on earth at the jref headquarters in front of witnesses from the miami herald both randi and lu successfully selected the same card the seven of diamonds the remaining cards were jettisoned for weight reasons before returning to earth but lu smuggled the card home the two cards complete with autographs are framed for public view at the jref offices in fort lauderdale fl randi asks lu "what are the odds that we would both choose the same card?" lu answers "knowing you and your tricky ways the odds were one in one because it's a trick!"{9]after

officer{11]on june 28 2012 lu with apollo 9 astronaut rusty schweickart and g scott hubbard astronautics professor at stanford university announced plans to build and operate the first privately-funded deep space mission called sentinel their non-profit b612 foundation will launch an infrared space telescope in orbit around the sun where from a distance as great as 270000000 kilometers (170000000xc2xa0mi) from earth where it would detect and track asteroids and other near-earth objects posing threats to the planetceo and co-founder of the b612 foundation (18 july
