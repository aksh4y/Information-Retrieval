by the time position fixes could be taken nancy was nearly a super typhoon moving gradually westward nancy explosively deepened and reached wind speeds equivalent to a categoryxc2xa05 (saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane scale) on september 9{1] it would maintain that intensity for the next several daysshortly after reaching peak intensity nancy approached the ryxc5xabkyxc5xab islands and began turning it passed near okinawa and over haze the ridge steering nancy broke down and the typhoon turned sharply and headed towards japan nancy made landfall as a strong typhoon on september 16 as it passed directly over muroto zaki nancy made a second landfall on honshxc5xab near osaka the typhoon rapidly traveled up the length of the island as it continued accelerating eventually reaching a forward speed of 65xc2xa0mph (100xc2xa0kmh 55xc2xa0knots){2] the typhoon quickly crossed over hokkaidxc5x8d before entering the sea of okhotsk as a tropical storm nancy went extratropical on september 17 the extratropical system eventually crossed over kamchatka and entered the open ocean{3]impact{edit]although no monetary value of all damage is known damage was "phenomenal"{2] in all areas where nancy hit there were at least 173 deaths and 19 people unaccounted forguam{edit]on guam over half of all crops were destroyed by heavy winds and rain a total of 40000 (1961 usd) worth of damage was done to roads on the island most of the damage was on the southern end of the island no deaths were reported on guam{2]japan{edit]in japan 172 people were killed 18 were missing and 3184 people were injured these totals made nancy the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit japan at the time timely warnings and adequate preparations were probably responsible for the relatively low death toll the damage was "small" relative to other typhoons that impacted densely populated areas of japan{2]hundreds of thousands of people had their lives disrupted super typhoon nancy destroyed 11539 houses damaged 32604 homes and flooded 280078 others although the exact number may never be known the stars and stripes reported in late september that over 1056 ships and fishing vessels were sunk or blown ashore and many more were damaged{2]floodwaters washed away 566 bridges and caused 1146 landslides roads were destroyed at a total of 2053 locations{2] damages in osaka amounted to 500xc2xa0million (1961xc2xa0usd){4]on okinawa low-lying areas experienced heavy flooding which did significant damage to agriculture and structures{2] on amami-o-shima one person was missing and another was badly injured a ship was sunk extensive flooding of crops and houses left 152 people homeless{2]due to nancy's damage and death toll the japan meteorological agency named nancy the "second muroto typhoon" nancy is one of only eight typhoons to receive special names in japanrecords{edit]a reconnaissance aircraft flying into the typhoon near its peak intensity on september 12 determined nancy's one-minute sustained winds to be 185xc2xa0knots (215xc2xa0mph; 345xc2xa0kmh) if these values are reliable they would be the highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone{5] however it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive thus nancy's winds may actually be lower than its official best-track value{5] in 2016 reanalysis of hurricane patricia noted that the storm had 215xc2xa0mph (345xc2xa0kmh) sustained winds which ties nancy and is the highest sustained winds in the western hemisphere{6]although the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale (sshws) didn't exist at the time nancy would have been a categoryxc2xa05 equivalent for a total of five and a half days (or 132 hours) assuming the windspeed data is reliable this is a record for the northern hemisphere and more than a day longer than the next-highest system 1962's typhoon karen{7]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portal1934 muroto typhoonother storms of the same nametyphoon neoguri (2014)hurricane irmareferences{edit]^ unisys tracking data accessed march 7 2006^ a b c d e f g h jtwc nancy report accessed march 7 2006^ digital typhoon: typhoon list view accessed march 7 2006^ david longshore encyclopedia of hurricanes typhoons and cyclones pg 233^ a b noaa tropical cyclone faq subject e1 archived 2010-12-06 at the wayback machine accessed march 7 2006^ feltgen dennis (february 4 2016) "tropical cyclone report for 2015xe2x80x99s hurricane patricia released" (pdf) (press release) national hurricane center retrieved february 4 2016xc2xa0^ noaa tropical cyclone faq subject e8 archived 2010-05-27 at the wayback machine accessed march 7 2006external links{edit]wikimedia commons has media related to typhoon nancy (1961)jma general information of typhoon nancy (6118) from digital typhoonjtwc report of typhoon nancystorm path of typhoon nancy retrieved from ""categories: 1961 pacific typhoon seasontyphoons in guamtyphoons in japan1961 in japantyphoonshidden categories: webarchive template wayback linksarticles containing japanese-language text navigation menupersonal toolsnot logged intalkcontributionscreate accountlog in namespacesarticletalkvariantsviewsreadeditview historymoresearch navigationmain pagecontentsfeatured contentcurrent eventsrandom articledonate to wikipediawikipedia store interactionhelpabout wikipediacommunity portalrecent changescontact page toolswhat links hererelated changesupload filespecial pagespermanent linkpage informationwikidata itemcite this page printexportcreate a bookdownload as pdfprintable version in other projectswikimedia commons languagesxd9x81xd8xa7xd8xb1xd8xb3xdbx8cxedx95x9cxeaxb5xadxecx96xb4xe6x97xa5xe6x9cxacxe8xaax9eportuguxc3xaassimple englishsvenskatixe1xbaxbfng vixe1xbbx87txe4xb8xadxe6x96x87 edit links  this page was last edited on 12 october 2017 at 11:40text is available under the creative commons attribution-sharealike license;additional terms may apply  by using this site you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy wikipediaxc2xae is a registered trademark of the wikimedia foundation inc a non-profit organizationprivacy policyabout wikipediadisclaimerscontact wikipediadeveloperscookie statementmobile view  '
