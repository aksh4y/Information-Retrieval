roy hargrove chris botti and viktor krauss{4] a departure from the jazzy groove-based urban sound of benxc3xa9t's previous work the album features an adult contemporary radio format style with sweeping strings layered vocals and nimble acoustic guitars{7] according to rashod d ollison of the washington post "hurricane is lush in spots the overall sound more in the adult contemporary vein more christopher cross less r kelly"{7]reception{edit]allmusic writer stephen thomas erlewine gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and commented that "the quiet storm is well performed but dull yet the prince-styled numbers are engaging melodic and nimble strong showcases for benet's mellow skills"{1] mojo gave the album three out of five stars and called it "a very palatable collection of self-penned confessional songs"{2] laura checkoway of vibe called it "an uneven mix of simplistic sentimentality" stating "reflective and repentant at times hurricane is more likely to sing you to sleep than knock you off your feet"{3] the washington post commented favorably on the album's themes of "healing and redemption" and stated "the spiritual tone often brings out the best in {eric benet]'s supple tenor on 'in the end' and other tracks"{4]track listing{edit]notitlewriter(s)producer(s)length1"be myself again"eric benxc3xa9t hod david andrew wyatteric benxc3xa9t hod
