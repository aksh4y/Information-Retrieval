industrialization and rail transportation baltimore shifted to a service-oriented economy with johns hopkins hospital (founded 1889) and johns hopkins university (founded 1876) now the city's top two employers{14]with hundreds of identified districts baltimore has been dubbed a "city of neighborhoods" famous residents have included writers edgar allan poe edith hamilton frederick douglass and hl

any other us city{17]the historical records of the government of baltimore are located at the baltimore city archivesetymology{edit]the city is named after cecil calvert second lord baltimore{19] (1605xe2x80x931675){20] of the irish house of lords and founding proprietor of the province of maryland{21]{22] baltimore manor was the name of the estate in county longford on which the calvert family lived in ireland{22]{23] baltimore is an anglicization of the irish name baile an txc3xad mhxc3xb3ir meaning "town of the big house"{22]before european settlement{edit]the baltimore area had been inhabited by native americans since at least the 10th millennium bc when paleo-indians first settled in the region one paleo-indian site and several archaic period and woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in baltimore including four from the late woodland period{24] during the late woodland period the archaeological culture that is called the "potomac creek complex" resided in the area from baltimore to the rappahannock river in virginia{25]in the early 1600s the immediate baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated if at all by native americans the baltimore county area northward was used as hunting grounds by the susquehannocks living in the lower susquehanna river valley who "controlled all of the upper tributaries of the chesapeake" but "refrained from much contact with powhatan in the potomac region"{26] pressured by the susquehannocks the piscataway tribe of algonquians stayed well south of the baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the potomac river in what is now charles county and southern prince george's county south of the fall line{27]{28]{29]colonial period{edit]european colonization of maryland began with the arrival of an english ship at st clement's island in the potomac river europeans began to settle the area further north beginning to populate the area of baltimore county{30] with its original county seat known today as "old baltimore" located on bush river within the present-day aberdeen proving ground{31]{32]{33] the colonists engaged in sporadic warfare with the susquhanna natives whose numbers dwindled from casualties and smallpox{30] in 1661 david jones claimed the area known today as jonestown on the east bank of the jones falls stream{34]the colonial general assembly of maryland created the port of baltimore at old whetstone point (now locust point) in 1706 for the tobacco trade the town of baltimore on the west side of the jones falls was founded and laid out on july 30 1729; with jonestown and fells point preexisting to the east the three settlements covering 60 acres became a commercial hub and in 1768 became the county seat{35]baltimore town in 1752 (at "the basin")baltimore grew swiftly in the 18th century as a granary for sugar-producing colonies in the caribbean the profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food{36] baltimore established its public market system in 1763{37] lexington market founded in 1782 continues to be known as one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in the united states today{38] lexington market was also known to be a place for slave trading which occurred all over the downtown area and was advertised in the baltimore sun{39] baltimore had the first post office system in the united states (inaugurated in 1774){40] and the first water company chartered in the united states (baltimore water company 1792){41]{42]baltimore played a key part in events leading to and including the american revolution city leaders such as jonathan plowman jr moved the city to join the resistance to british taxes and merchants signed agreements to not trade with britain{43] the second continental congress met in the henry fite house from december 1776 to february 1777 effectively making the city the capital of the united states during this period{44]antebellum period{edit]the town of baltimore jonestown and fells point were incorporated as the city of baltimore in 1796xe2x80x931797 the city remained a part of surrounding baltimore county and continued to serve as its county seat from 1768xe2x80x931851 after which it became an independent city{45]bombardment of fort mchenry by the british engraved by john bower {46]the battle of baltimore against the british in 1814 inspired the composition of the usa's national anthem "the star-spangled banner" and the construction of the battle monument which became the city's official emblem a distinctive local culture started to take shape and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed baltimore acquired its moniker "the monumental city" after an 1827 visit to baltimore by president john quincy adams at an evening function adams gave the following toast: "baltimore: the monumental cityxe2x80x94may the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant"{47]{48]the battle monument is the official emblem of the city of baltimorebaltimore pioneered the use of gas lighting in 1816 and its population grew rapidly in the following decades with concomitant development of culture and infrastructure the construction of the federally funded national road (which later became part of us route 40) and the private baltimore and ohio railroad (b  o) made baltimore a major shipping and manufacturing center by linking the city with major markets in the midwest by 1820 its population had reached 60000 and its economy had shifted from its base in tobacco plantations to sawmilling shipbuilding and textile production these industries benefited from war but successfully shifted into infrastructure development during peacetime{49]baltimore suffered one of the worst riots of the antebellum south in 1835 when bad investments led to the baltimore bank riot{50] soon after the city created the world's first dental college the baltimore college of dental surgery in 1840 and shared in the world's first telegraph line between baltimore and washington dc in 1844sixth regiment fighting railroad strikers july 20 1877{51]civil war and after{edit]maryland a slave state with abundant popular support for secession in some areas remained part of the union during the american civil war due in part to the union's strategic occupation of the city in 1861{52]{53] baltimore saw the first casualties of the war on april 19 1861 when union soldiers en route from the president street station to camden yards clashed with a secessionist mob in the pratt street riotin the midst of the long depression which followed the panic of 1873 the baltimore  ohio railroad company attempted to lower its workers' wages leading to strikes and riots in the city and beyond strikers clashed with the national guard leaving 10 dead and 25 wounded{54]20th century through 1968{edit]the great baltimore fire of 1904 looking west from pratt and gay streetson february 7 1904 the great baltimore fire destroyed over 1500 buildings in 30 hours leaving more than 70 blocks of the downtown area burned to the ground damages were estimated at 150xc2xa0millionxe2x80x94in 1904 dollars{55] as the city rebuilt during the next two years lessons learned from the fire led to improvements in firefighting equipment standards{56]the city grew in area by annexing new suburbs from the surrounding counties through 1918 when the city acquired portions of baltimore county and anne arundel county{57] a state constitutional amendment approved in 1948 required a special vote of the citizens in any proposed annexation area effectively preventing any future expansion of the city's boundaries{58] streetcars enabled the development of distant neighborhoods areas such as edmonson village whose residents could easily commute to work downtown{59]driven by migration from the deep south and by white suburbanization the relative size of the city's black population grew from 238 in 1950 to 464 in 1970{60] encouraged by real estate blockbusting techniques recently settled white areas rapidly became all-black neighborhoods in a rapid process which was nearly total by 1970{61]1968 and after{edit]the baltimore riot of 1968 coinciding with riots in other cities followed the assassination of martin luther king jr on april 4 1968 public order was not restored until april 12 1968 the baltimore riot cost the city an estimated 10xc2xa0million (us 69 million in 2017) a total of 11000 maryland national guard and federal troops were ordered into the city{62] lasting effects of the riot can be seen on the streets of north avenue howard street gay street and pennsylvania avenue where long stretches of the streets remain barren{63] the city experienced challenges again in 1974 when teachers municipal workers and police officers conducted strikes{64]following the death of freddie gray in april 2015 the city experienced major protests and international media attention as well as a clash between local youth and police which resulted in a state of emergency declaration and curfew{65]baltimore has suffered from a high homicide rate for several decades peaking in 1993 and again in 2015{66]{67] these deaths have taken a severe toll especially on the local black community{68]development and promotion{edit]by the beginning of the 1970s baltimore's downtown area known as the inner harbor had been neglected and was occupied by a collection of abandoned warehouses the nickname "charm city" came from a 1975 meeting of advertisers seeking to improve the city's reputation{69]{70] efforts to redevelop the area started with the construction of the maryland science center which opened in 1976 the baltimore world trade center (1977) and the baltimore convention center (1979) harborplace an urban retail and restaurant complex opened on the waterfront in 1980 followed by the national aquarium maryland's largest tourist destination and the baltimore museum of industry in 1981 during the epidemic of hivaids in the united states baltimore city health department official robert mehl persuaded the city's mayor to form a committee to address food problems; the baltimore-based charity moveable feast grew out of this initiative in 1990{71]{72]{73] by 2010 the organization's region of service had expanded from merely baltimore to include all of the eastern shore of maryland{74] in 1992 the baltimore orioles baseball team moved from memorial stadium to oriole park at camden yards located downtown near the harbor pope john paul ii held an open-air mass at camden yards during his papal visit to the united states in october 1995 three years later the baltimore ravens football team moved into mt bank stadium next to camden yards{75]baltimore has seen the reopening of the hippodrome theatre in 2004{76] the opening of the reginald f lewis museum of maryland african american history  culture in 2005 and the establishment of the national slavic museum in 2012 on april 12 2012 johns hopkins held a dedication ceremony to mark the completion of one of the united states' largest medical complexesxc2xa0xe2x80x93 the johns hopkins hospital in baltimorexc2xa0xe2x80x93 which features the sheikh zayed cardiovascular and

bin zayed al nahyan first president of the united arab emirates and michael bloomberg{77]{78]on september 19 2016 the baltimore city council approved a 660 million bond deal for the 55 billion port covington redevelopment project championed by under armour founder kevin plank and his real estate company sagamore development port covington surpassed the harbor point development as the largest tax-increment financing deal in baltimore's history and among the largest urban redevelopment projects in the country{79] the waterfront development that includes the new headquarters for under armour as well as shops housing offices and manufacturing spaces is projected to create 26500 permanent jobs with a 43 billion annual economic impact{80] goldman sachs invested 233 million into the redevelopment project{81]geography{edit]baltimore is in north-central maryland on the patapsco river close to where it empties into the chesapeake bay the city is also located on the fall line between the piedmont plateau and the atlantic coastal plain which divides baltimore into "lower city" and "upper city" the city's elevation ranges from sea level at the harbor to 480 feet (150xc2xa0m) in the

mid-1790s developers began building entire neighborhoods of the british-style rowhouses which became the dominant house type of the city early in the 19th century{86]formstone facings now a common

358xc2xa0xc2xb0f (21xc2xa0xc2xb0c){123] though temperatures reach 50xc2xa0xc2xb0f (10xc2xa0xc2xb0c) rather often and drop below 20xc2xa0xc2xb0f (xe2x88x927xc2xa0xc2xb0c) when arctic air masses affect the area{123]the average seasonal snowfall is 201 inches (51xc2xa0cm){124] but it varies greatly depending on the winter with some seasons seeing minimal snow while others see several major nor'easters {a] due to lessened urban heat island (uhi) as compared to the city proper and distance from the moderating chesapeake bay the outlying and inland parts of the baltimore metro area are usually cooler especially at night than the city proper and the coastal towns thus in the northern and western suburbs winter snowfall is more significant and some areas average more than 30xc2xa0in (76xc2xa0cm) of snow per winter{126] it is by no means uncommon for the rain-snow line to set up in the metro area{127] freezing rain and sleet occurs a few times each winter in the area as warm air overrides cold air at the low to mid-levels of the atmosphere when the wind blows from the east the cold air gets dammed against the mountains to the west and the result is freezing rain or sleetspring and autumn are warm with spring being the wettest season in terms of the number of precipitation days summers are hot and humid with a daily average in july of 807xc2xa0xc2xb0f (271xc2xa0xc2xb0c){123] and the combination of heat and humidity leads to rather frequent thunderstorms a southeasterly bay breeze off the chesapeake often occurs on summer afternoons when hot air rises over inland areas; prevailing winds from the southwest interacting with this breeze as well as the city proper's uhi can seriously exacerbate air quality{128]{129] in late summer and early

outline of the city's border and denote the distance to destinations much like bicycle routes in the rest of the state the roads carrying bicycle routes are also labelled with either bike lanes sharrows or share the road signs many of these routes pass through the downtown area the network of bicycle lanes in the city continues to expand with over 140 miles added between 2006 and 2014{253] alongside bike lanes baltimore has also built bike boulevards starting with guilford avenue in 2012baltimore currently has three major trail systems within the city the gwynns falls trail runs from the inner harbor to the i-70 park and ride passing through gwynns falls park and possessing numerous branches there are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park the jones falls trail currently runs from the inner harbor to the cylburn arboretum; however it is currently undergoing expansion long term plans call for it to extend to the mount washington light rail stop and possibly as far north as the falls road stop to connect to the robert e lee boardwalk north of the city it will also incorporate a spur alongside western run the two aforementioned trails carry sections of the east coast greenway through the city there is also the herring run trail which runs from harford road east to its end beyond sinclair lane utilizing herring run park; long term plans also call for its extension to morgan state university and north to points beyond other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both maryland avenue and mount royal avenue expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016 respectivelyin addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks baltimore has the stony run trail

to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets a 2011 study by walk score ranked baltimore the 14th most walkable of fifty largest us

background north of the cityfrancis scott key bridge over the baltimore harborthe port was founded in 1706 preceding the founding of baltimore the maryland colonial legislature made the area near locust point as the port of entry for the tobacco trade with england fells point the deepest point in the natural harbor soon became the colony's main ship building center later on becoming leader in the construction of clipper ships{255]after baltimore's founding mills were built behind the wharves the california gold rush led to many orders for fast vessels; many overland pioneers also relied upon canned goods from baltimore after the civil war a coffee ship was designed here for trade with brazil at the end of the nineteenth century european ship lines had terminals for immigrants the baltimore and ohio railroad made the port a major transshipment point{256]:1775 currently the port has major roll-onroll-off facilities as well as bulk facilities especially steel handling{257]water taxis also operate in the inner harbor governor ehrlich participated in naming the port after helen delich bentley during the 300th anniversary of the port{258]in 2007 duke realty corporation began a new development near the port of baltimore named the chesapeake commerce center this new industrial park is located on the site of a former general motors plant the total project comprises 184 acres (074xc2xa0km2) in eastern baltimore city and the site will yield 2800000 square feet (260000xc2xa0m2) of warehousedistribution and office space chesapeake commerce center has direct access to two major interstate highways (i-95 and i-895) and is located adjacent to two of the major port of baltimore terminals the port of baltimore is one of two seaports on the us east coast with a 50-foot (15xc2xa0m) dredge to accommodate the largest shipping vessels{259]along with cargo terminals the port also has a passenger cruise terminal which offers year-round trips on several lines including royal caribbean's grandeur of the seas and carnival's pride overall five cruise lines have operated out of the port to the bahamas and the caribbean while some ships traveled to new england and canada

and new jersey make up a third of the volume with travelers from maryland virginia the district and even ohio and the carolinas making up the rest{261]environment{edit]baltimore's inner harbor known for its skyline waterscape and its tourist-friendly areas was horribly polluted the waterway was often filled with garbage after heavy rainstorms failing its 2014 water quality report card the waterfront partnership of baltimore took steps to remediate the waterways in hopes that the harbor would be fishable and swimmable once againtrash interceptors{edit]the "mr trash wheel" trash interceptor at the mouth of the jones falls river in baltimore's inner harbormain article: trash interceptor xc2xa7xc2xa0baltimore's mr trash wheelinstalled in may 2014 the water wheel trash interceptor known as mr trash wheel sits at the mouth of the jones falls river in baltimore's inner harbor a february 2015 agreement with a local waste-to-energy plant is believed to make baltimore the first city to use reclaimed waterway debris to generate electricity{262]mr trash wheel is the world's first permanent water wheel trash interceptor to clean up the city's polluted inner harbor{263] the jones falls river watershed drains fifty-eight square miles of land outside of baltimore and is a significant source of trash that enters the harbor garbage collected by mr trash wheel could come from anywhere in the jones falls watershed area{264] the wheel moves continuously removing garbage and dumping it into an attached dumpster using only hydro and solar renewable power to keep its wheel turning it has the capability to collect 50000 pounds of trash per day and has removed more than 350 tons of litter from baltimore's landmark and tourist attraction in its first 18 months estimated as consisting of approximately 200000 bottles 173000 potato chip bags and 67 million cigarettes butts{265]{266] the water wheel has been very successful at trash removal visibly decreasing the amount of garbage that collects in the harbor especially after a rainfallafter the success of mr trash wheel the waterfront partnership raised money to build a second water wheel at the end of harris creek an entirely piped stream that flows beneath baltimore's canton neighborhood and empties into the baltimore harbor harris creek is known to carry tons of trash every year{267]{268]{269] the planned new water wheel was inaugurated in december 2016 and dubbed "professor trash wheel"{270] professor trash wheel prevents waste from exiting the harbor and accessing the chesapeake bay and atlantic ocean a number of additional projects are going on in baltimore city and county that should result in better water quality scores these projects include the blue alleys project expanded street sweeping and stream restoration{263]other water pollution control{edit]in august 2010 the national aquarium assembled planted and launched a floating wetland island designed by biohabitats in baltimore's inner harbor{271] hundreds of years ago baltimore's harbor shoreline would have been lined with tidal wetlands floating wetlands provide many environmental benefits to water quality and habitat enhancement which is why the waterfront partnership of baltimore has included them in their healthy harbor initiative pilot projects{272] biohabitats also developed a concept to transform a dilapidated wharf into a living pier that cleans harbor water provides habitat and is an aesthetic attraction currently under design the top of the pier will become a constructed tidal wetland{273]media{edit]main article: media in baltimorebaltimore's main newspaper is the baltimore sun it was sold by its baltimore owners in 1986 to the times mirror company{274] which was bought by
