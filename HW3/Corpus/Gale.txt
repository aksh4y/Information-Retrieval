hamiltongale warning flagthe us national weather service defines a gale as 34xe2x80x9347 knots (63xe2x80x9387 kmh 175xe2x80x93242 ms or 39xe2x80x9354 mileshour) of sustained surface winds{1] forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expectedother sources use minima as low as 28 knots (52xc2xa0kmh 32xc2xa0mph) and maxima as high as 90 knots (170xc2xa0kmh 100xc2xa0mph) through 1986 the national hurricane center used the term gale to refer to winds of tropical force for coastal areas between 33 knots (61xc2xa0kmh 38xc2xa0mph) and 63 knots (117xc2xa0kmh 72xc2xa0mph) the 90 knots (170xc2xa0kmh 100xc2xa0mph) definition is very non-standard a common alternative definition of the maximum is 55 knots (102xc2xa0kmh 63xc2xa0mph){2]the most common way of measuring winds is with the beaufort scale{3] which defines a gale as wind from 50 to 102xc2xa0kmh it is an empirical measure for describing wind speed based mainly on observed sea conditions its full name is the beaufort wind force scaleon the beaufort wind scale a gale is classified as: 7: moderatexc2xa0gale (32xe2x80x9338 miles per hour) 8: freshxc2xa0gale (39-46xc2xa0mph) 9: strongxc2xa0gale
