two-seated cargeorge gets the cleaners to do the offices at yankee stadium where they find a new recruitxe2x80x94george's boss mr wilhelm he joins under the name tania (the name patty hearst took after she was kidnapped by the symbionese liberation army) upset george asks the head cult cleaner "him you brainwashed?? what's he got that i don't have?!" the cleaner simply shrugs because of the humidity from the hot tub the wooden chest warps and kramer's guests who just before the meeting along with kramer convince george to come in the tub get stuck in the drawers because of the sake they had still having writer's cramp jerry uses a fire ax from the hallway to smash open the chest which scares the japanese guests and injures brett who is knocked unconscious when he attempts to stop jerry from damaging the chest the scared japanese tourists tell the japanese tv executives about the incident ruining any chance of selling the "jerry" pilot to japanese television during the coda it
