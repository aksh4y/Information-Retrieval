wednesday storm struck the coast the town was completely underwater and went for days without electricity the storm destroyed almost all structures on assateague island where development was just beginning following this most of the island was preserved from development as assateague island national seashore in 1965the assateague lighthouse and captain timothy hill house are listed on the national register of historic places{8]{8]{9]chincoteague ponies{edit]main article: chincoteague ponylegend has it that the feral ponies on assateague are descendants of survivors of a spanish galleon that sank on its way to spain during a storm in 1750 off the east coast but the likelihood is that they are actually descended from domesticated stock brought to the island by eastern shore farmers in the 17th century to avoid fencing requirements and taxation{10]in the pony penning which has been held annually since 1925 horses swim across the shallow water between the islands if any animal is too small or weak to make the swim it is placed on a barge and ferried over all the horses are herded into large pens after running through the middle of town and down main street pony penning takes place on the last consecutive wednesday and thursday in july the actual swim occurs on wednesday the chincoteague volunteer fire company auctions that year's foals on thursday and on friday the remaining
