hurricane seasonhurricane celia was the costliest tropical cyclone in texas history until hurricane alicia in 1983 the third named storm second hurricane and first major hurricane of the 1970 atlantic hurricane season celia developed from a tropical wave in the western caribbean sea on julyxc2xa031 initially the depression tracked north-northwestward without significantly strengthening and crossed over western cuba on augustxc2xa01 heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding leading to five fatalities the depression entered the gulf of mexico and was upgraded to tropical storm celia later on augustxc2xa01 due to warm sea surface temperatures celia rapidly intensified into a major hurricane on august 1 and after the creation of the saffirxe2x80x93simpson hurricane wind scale in 1971 she was estimated to have been a category 3 storm storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of florida especially the panhandle causing eight people to drown early on augustxc2xa02 celia began to weaken however the storm underwent rapid deepening again and peaked as a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane with winds of 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) on augustxc2xa03in louisiana tides caused minor coastal flooding minor erosion damage was reported along highway 82 in cameron parish late on augustxc2xa03 celia made landfall near corpus christi texas throughout the state 8950xc2xa0homes were destroyed

some degree celia weakened as it continued further inland and dissipated over new mexico on augustxc2xa06 the remnants of celia brought up to 2 inches (51xc2xa0mm) of rainfall to the state overall this storm caused 28xc2xa0deaths and 930xc2xa0million (1970xc2xa0usd) in damagecontents1 meteorological history2 preparations3 impact31 cuba and florida32 texas321 nueces county33 elsewhere4 aftermath41 retirement5 see also6 references7 external linksmeteorological history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scalea tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean from the west coast of africa in late july; a weather station in dakar senegal observed a wind shift on julyxc2xa023 the system moved quickly across the atlantic at 20 and 25xc2xa0mph (32 and 40xc2xa0kmh) and reached the lesser antilles by julyxc2xa028{1] the wave then continued moving rapidly westward across the caribbean sea however falling atmospheric pressures over the southern united states eroded a subtropical ridge causing the system to decelerate by julyxc2xa030 around that time a closed circulation began to organize in the northwestern caribbean between the cayman islands and swan island{2] at 0000xc2xa0utc on julyxc2xa031 a tropical depression developed about 90xc2xa0mi (145xc2xa0km) west-southwest of grand cayman{3] the depression strengthened while heading north-northwestward though a reconnaissance aircraft could not complete its mission on julyxc2xa031 due to the depression's proximity to cuba{2]early on augustxc2xa01 the depression made landfall in western pinar del rxc3xado province cuba{3] a weather station in cape san antonio recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1007xc2xa0mbar (297xc2xa0inhg) after reaching the southeastern gulf of mexico on augustxc2xa01 warm sea surface temperatures caused the depression to undergo rapid deepening later that day the depression reached tropical storm intensity and was named "celia" based on a reconnaissance flight observing tropical storm force winds{2] satellite imagery indicated that celia was becoming significantly more organized{4] at 0000xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa02 reconnaissance aircraft data indicated that celia suddenly strengthened into a categoryxc2xa03 hurricane with sustained winds of 115xc2xa0mph (185xc2xa0kmh){3]{4] however the storm weakened to a categoryxc2xa02 hurricane about six hours later{3] due to celia's steady west-northwestward motion across the gulf of mexico the national hurricane center marked that the storm "aimed at the corpus christi area like a wild beast stalking its prey"{4] early on augustxc2xa03 it weakened further to a categoryxc2xa01 hurricane{3]unexpectedly celia underwent rapid deepening once again while nearing the coast of texas later on augustxc2xa03 including a 39xc2xa0mbar (12xc2xa0inhg) decrease in pressure in only 15xc2xa0hours{4] at 1800xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa03 celia attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125xc2xa0mph (205xc2xa0kmh) and a minimum barometric pressure of 945xc2xa0mbar (279xc2xa0inhg) shortly thereafter the storm made landfall near corpus christi texas at the same intensity{3] celia "maintained strength for an unusually long time" after moving inland{4] weakening to a tropical storm at 0600xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa04 early on the following day the storm further weakened to a tropical depression celia dissipated over western texas at 1800xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa05{3] though the remnants persisted until reaching new mexico{5]preparations{edit]in the gulf of mexico oil rig crew workers began leaving and headed for land residents of texas coastal towns of high island port bolivar and gilchrist were evacuated further inland{6] the national hurricane center also issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the coast of texas in anticipation of the storm at 1600xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa02 a hurricane warning was posted from palacios to port arthur about six hours later the warning was extended southward to rockport the hurricane warning was expanded further southward to corpus christi at 1000xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa03{7]impact{edit]celia caused 27 fatalities four in cuba eight in florida and 15 in texas and left 930xc2xa0million in damages{8] corpus christi texas suffered the worst impact with at least 85 of all the structures in the city damaged with 90 of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed additionally about one-third of houses were severely damaged or flattened{9]cuba and florida{edit]as a tropical depression celia dropped heavy rains over western cuba resulting in major flooding four people drowned and another man was electrocuted in the water when he tried to retrieve a downed power line{2] while over the central gulf of mexico strong rip currents and large swells affected florida measuring up to 10 feet (30xc2xa0m) in the panhandle in escambia county alone at least 12xc2xa0lifeguard rescues occurred pensacola beach was closed to the public on septemberxc2xa03 after several rescues on the previous day eight people drowned due to adverse water conditions in the florida panhandle{9]texas{edit]boats blown ashore by celia at aransas passthe most severe damage was in corpus christi and aransas pass throughout the state 8950xc2xa0homes were destroyed and it damaged about 55650xc2xa0others about 252xc2xa0small businesses 331xc2xa0boats and 310xc2xa0farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed initially losses were estimated to have reached 434xc2xa0million however due to lower insurance rate of coverage the original insured losses 310xc2xa0million were tripled rather than doubled thus the damage toll was revised upward to 930xc2xa0million in 2011 damage to crops was slightly more than 88xc2xa0million in addition celia caused 15xc2xa0fatalities and injured 466xc2xa0others the most severe damage occurred in the streaks of damage not by tornadoes but a series microbursts and downbursts most of which occurred in a 15xc2xa0minute span survivors of the storm described the downbursts as "rocket shells" exploding{10] however areas between the streaks suffered surprisingly little damage mainly ornamental due to debris from the homes nearby{11] celia dropped heavy rains as it made landfall however due to the small size and fast movement of the storm precipitation was not widespread at the time of landfall much of texas was suffering from a drought most areas received 3 to 4xc2xa0in (76 to 102xc2xa0mm){12]in alvin a small tornado caused the destruction of a few fences and moved a pickup truck{9] downed trees caused slight property damage in amistad dam a municipality in val verde

shingle or metal roofs in crystal city impact on trees and crops were minimal thus the reported wind speeds of 85xe2x80x9390xc2xa0mph (137xe2x80x93145xc2xa0kmh) were considered "doubtful"{17]property damage in del rio was about 1xc2xa0million{18] with wind impacts mostly to roofs mobile homes signs boats windows trees and homes under construction while some businesses and homes were flooded{19] in frio county a tornado spawned in the dilley area toppled utility poles destroyed several chicken houses and blew the roof of a house 600 to 900 feet (180 to 270xc2xa0m) away in addition two farm houses were deroofed and several outhouses were damaged another tornado spawned nearby caused "considerable" damage to the dilley civic center destroyed machine sheds unroofed outbuildings and felled

(260xc2xa0kmh) in sandia damaged every house 90 of cotton crops and caused 1xc2xa0fatality{26] although wind gusts of 168xc2xa0mph (270xc2xa0kmh) were observed in taft only 5xc2xa0million in property and 500000 in crop damages were reported{27] in tilden the storm brought maximum sustained winds up to 100xc2xa0mph (160xc2xa0kmh) as a result the entire city lost telephone and electrical services

crossing the gulf of mexico celia produced tides 1 to 2 feet (030 to 061xc2xa0m) above normal on the southwestern coast of louisiana as a result slight erosion of louisiana highway 82 occurred in cameron parish between johnson bayou and holly beach no damage or fatalities were reported in that state{32] after dissipating the remnants of celia produced up to 2 inches (51xc2xa0mm) of rain in new
