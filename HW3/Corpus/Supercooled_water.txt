subcoolingsupercooling also known as undercooling{1] is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid or a gas below its freezing point without it becoming a solidcontents1 explanation2 constitutional supercooling3 in animals4 in plants5 applications6 see also7 references8 further reading9 external linksexplanation{edit]a liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid lacking any such nuclei the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will formwater normally freezes at 27315xc2xa0k (0xc2xa0xc2xb0c or 32xc2xa0xc2xb0f) but it can be "supercooled" at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost 2248xc2xa0k (xe2x88x92483xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x88x9255xc2xa0xc2xb0f){2]{3] the process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of nucleation sites which can be achieved by processes like reverse osmosis or chemical demineralization but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique if water is cooled at a rate on the order of 106xc2xa0ks the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass xe2x80x94 that is an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid its glass transition temperature is much colder and harder to determine but studies estimate it at about 136xc2xa0k (xe2x88x92137xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x88x92215xc2xa0xc2xb0f){4] glassy water can be heated up to approximately 150xc2xa0k (xe2x88x92123xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x88x921894xc2xa0xc2xb0f) without nucleation occurring{3] in the range of temperatures between 231xc2xa0k (xe2x88x9242xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x88x92436xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and 150xc2xa0k (xe2x88x92123xc2xa0xc2xb0cxe2x88x921894xc2xa0xc2xb0f) experiments find only crystal icedroplets of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds an aircraft flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate de-icing system freezing rain is also caused by supercooled dropletsthe process opposite to supercooling the melting of a solid above the freezing point is much more difficult and a solid will almost always melt at the same temperature for a given pressure for this reason it is the melting point which is usually identified using melting point apparatus; even when the subject of a paper is "freezing-point determination" the actual methodology is "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice"{5] it is possible at a given pressure to superheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseoussupercooling is often confused with freezing-point depression supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid freezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium chloride is added to pure waterconstitutional supercooling{edit]constitutional supercooling xe2x80x93 phase diagram concentration and temperatureconstitutional supercooling which occurs during solidification is due to compositional solid changes and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the solidxe2x80x93liquid interface when solidifying a liquid the interface is often unstable and the velocity of the solidxe2x80x93liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercoolingsupercooled zones are observed when the liquidus temperature gradient at the interface is

following paragraphs are about freezing-point depression they are not about supercooling the authors are confusing supercooling with freezing-point depression the paragraphs above warn about this confusionin order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments some animals use the phenomenon of freezing-point depression that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death there are many techniques that aid in lowering the freezing point such as the production of antifreeze proteins or afps which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice{7] the winter flounder is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the bloodstream{8] other animals use colligative antifreezes which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids thus lowering their freezing point fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing supercooling is also common in insects reptiles and other ectotherms with insects being able to survive in the coldest environments out of any supercooling animalsit should be noted that supercooling is a last resort for animals the best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible as an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids as this is a thermodynamically unstable state the fluids eventually reach the supercooling point which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point{9] animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled even though supercooling is essential for survival there are many risks associated with itin plants{edit]as demonstrated by animals plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling thus these plants survive temperatures up to -40xc2xa0xc2xb0c although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood it has been recognized through infrared thermography ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues debatably beginning in the xylem tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the plant{10]{11] infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular spaces{12]supercooling inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice{12] cellular barriers such as lignin suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue{13] the xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold{14] supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs rhododendron ferrugineum and vaccinium vitis-idaea as well as abies picea and larix species{14] freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant{15] however the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration{11]applications{edit]one commercial application of supercooling is in refrigeration freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled level{16] so that when they are opened they form a slush another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional freezer{17] the coca-cola company briefly marketed special vending machines containing sprite in the uk and coke in singapore which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to slush upon opening{18]supercooling was successfully applied to organ preservation at massachusetts general hospitalharvard medical school livers that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 96 hours (4 days) quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods the livers were supercooled to a temperature of xe2x80x936xc2xa0xc2xb0c in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold temperature{19]another potential application is drug delivery in 2015 researchers demonstrated the ability to crystallize membranes at a specific time liquid-encapsulated drugs can potentially be delivered to the site and with a slight environmental change the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the drug{20]in 2016 a team at iowa state university proposed a method for "soldering without heat" by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic devices{21]{22]see also{edit]amorphous solidpumpable ice
