2569xc2xa0inhg) on octoberxc2xa012 at its peak strength it was also the largest tropical cyclone on record with a wind diameter of 2220xc2xa0km (1380xc2xa0mi) tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast in response to an approaching trough the typhoon made landfall in southern japan on octoberxc2xa019 and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafterus air force aircraft flew 60xc2xa0weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon making tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones{1] rainfall from tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13xc2xa0marines and injured 68 at combined arms training center camp fuji in the shizuoka prefecture of japan{2] elsewhere in the country the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42xc2xa0deaths;

272xc2xa0inhg) from octoberxc2xa09 to 11 during which the circulation pattern of typhoon tip expanded to a record diameter of 2220xc2xa0km (1380xc2xa0mi) tip continued to intensify further and early on octoberxc2xa012 reconnaissance aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870xc2xa0mbar (8700xc2xa0hpa; 2569xc2xa0inhg) with winds of 305xc2xa0kmh (190xc2xa0mph) when tip was located about 840xc2xa0km (520xc2xa0mi) west-northwest of guam{1] in its best track the japan meteorological agency listed tip as peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of 160xc2xa0mph (260xc2xa0kmh){3] at the time of its peak strength its eye was 15xc2xa0km (93xc2xa0mi) wide{1] tip crossed the 135th meridian east on the afternoon of octoberxc2xa013 prompting the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration to issue warnings on typhoon tip assigning it the local name warlingafter peaking intensity tip weakened to 230xc2xa0kmh (140xc2xa0mph) and remained at that intensity for several days as it continued west-northwestward for five days after its peak strength the average radius of winds stronger than 55xc2xa0kmh (34xc2xa0mph) extended over 1100xc2xa0km (684xc2xa0mi) on octoberxc2xa017 tip began to weaken steadily and decrease in size recurving northeastward under the influence of a mid-level trough the next day after passing about 65xc2xa0km (40xc2xa0mi) east of okinawa the typhoon accelerated to 75xc2xa0kmh (47xc2xa0mph) tip made landfall on the japanese island of honshxc5xab with winds of about 130xc2xa0kmh (81xc2xa0mph) on octoberxc2xa019 it continued rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern honshxc5xab a few hours after moving ashore{1] the extratropical remnant of tip proceeded northeastward and gradually weakened crossing the international date line on octoberxc2xa022 the storm was last observed near the aleutian islands of alaska on october 24{3]impact{edit]most intense pacific typhoonstyphoonseasonpressurehpainhgtip1979870257june1975876259nora1973877259ida1958877259kit1966880260rita1978880260vanessa1984880260irma1971884261nina1953885261joan1959885261forrest1983885261megi2010885261source:jma typhoon best track analysisinformation for the north western pacific ocean{4]the typhoon produced heavy rainfall early in its lifetime while passing near guam including a total of 231xc2xa0cm (909xc2xa0in) at andersen air force base{1] the outer rainbands of the large circulation of tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the philippine island of luzon{5]heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at camp fuji a training facility for the united states marine corps near yokosuka{6] marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated at the base of a hill which housed a fuel farm the breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders releasing large quantities of fuel the fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts{7]{8]{9] the resultant fire killed 13 marines injured 68{1] and caused moderate damage to the facility the facility's barracks were destroyed{6] along with fifteen huts and several other structures{7]{10] the barracks were rebuilt{6] and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire{7]during recurvature typhoon tip passed about 65xc2xa0km (40xc2xa0mi) east of okinawa sustained winds reached 72xc2xa0kmh (44xc2xa0mph) with gusts to 112xc2xa0kmh (69xc2xa0mph) sustained wind velocities in japan are not known though they were estimated at minimal typhoon strength the passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in millions of dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country{1] eight ships were grounded or sunk by tip leaving 44xc2xa0fishermen dead or unaccounted for a chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon though its crew of 46 were rescued{5] the rainfall led to over 600xc2xa0mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of japan and flooded more than 22000xc2xa0homes;

for instance satellite-derived intensity estimates for typhoon haiyan of 2013 indicated that its core pressure may have been as low as 858xc2xa0mbar (2534xc2xa0inhg){22] due to the dearth of direct observations into these cyclones conclusive data are lacking{21]despite the typhoon's intensity and damage the name tip was not retired and was reused in 1983 1986 and 1989{3]see also{edit]tropical cyclones portalhurricane patricialist of tropical cyclone recordstyphoon nancy (1961)other tropical cyclones named tiptyphoon wipha (2013)typhoon lan xe2x80x94 a recent storm that was the second largest on record behind tipnotes{edit]^ all wind speeds in the article are maximum sustained winds sustained for one minute unless otherwise notedreferences{edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j k george m dunnavan;
