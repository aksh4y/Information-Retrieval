55xc2xa0kmh) in a 24-hour period{1]contents1 necessary conditions11 external12 internal2 previous nomenclature and definitions3 notable instances4 see also5 referencesnecessary conditions{edit]external{edit]in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely warm (near or above 30xc2xa0xc2xb0c 86xc2xa0xc2xb0f) and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface wind shear must be low; when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disruptedinternal{edit]usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as wellxe2x80x94for extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently{2]{further explanation needed] hot towers have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification though diagnostically has seen varied skill across basins{3]previous nomenclature and definitions{edit]the united states national hurricane center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone when the minimum central pressure decreased by 42 millibars (1240xc2xa0inhg) over a 24-hour period{4]{when?] however it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots (35xc2xa0mph; 55xc2xa0kmh) in a 24-hour period{1] the term explosive cyclogenesis has been confused with rapid intensification in the literature{citation needed] however due to the redefinition based on sustained wind speeds rapid intensification is being applied to tropical systems while explosive cyclogenesis and associated terms to extratropical cyclones{citation needed]notable instances{edit]this section includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this section by introducing more precise citations (september 2017) (learn how and when to remove this template message)this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedia's quality standards the specific problem is: section uses multiple definitions of rapid intensificationdeepening please help improve this section if you can (september 2017) (learn how and when to remove this template message)in 1983 super typhoon forrest underwent one of the most explosive deepening events ever recorded with the pressure dropping from 975 to 885 millibars as it went from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 24 hours{5]{6]in 1992 hurricane andrew was just a minimum hurricane a day before making landfall in the bahamas when it began to rapidly deepen into a category 5 hurricane right up to its landfall at peak strength it weakened significantly over the island chain but it soon hit open water again and rapidly intensified back into a category 5 hurricane just hours before making a second landfall at category 5 strength in florida{7]on september 10 1997 hurricane linda was just a tropical storm the next day linda became a minimal hurricane by 6am on september 12 however linda's wind speeds increased to a record 185xc2xa0mph the pressure dropping at an average rate of 338 millibars per hour{8]in 2004 hurricane charley was approaching the west coast of florida as a category two storm on the saffir-simpson scale of hurricane strength when just off the coast however its sustained winds rapidly increased from 110 to 150xc2xa0mph (along with a pressure drop from 965 to 941xc2xa0mbar) in only three hours charley caused unprecedented destruction in the punta gorda area and inflicted major damage across the state of florida{9]hurricane wilma at record intensityduring 2005 hurricane wilma sustained winds rapidly intensified from 60 knots (70xc2xa0mph; 110xc2xa0kmh) to 150 knots (175xc2xa0mph; 280xc2xa0kmh) within 24 hours{10] as a result wilma intensified from being a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale{10] over the same time span the pressure dropped from 982 millibars (2900xc2xa0inhg) to 892 millibars (2634xc2xa0inhg){10] hurricane katrina and hurricane rita both rapidly intensified katrina from a category 2 to a 5 and rita from a 2 to a 5 katrina rapidly weakened as a result dropping one category every 6 hours rita kept cat 5 intensity for 24 hours before slowly weakening to a category 3 and dropping to a cat 1 just after landfallin 2006 the minimum central pressure of typhoon chebi in the western pacific dropped 75 mbar in 24 hours including a 60 mbar pressure drop in 6 hours as it intensified from a tropical storm to a category four equivalent typhoon in one advisory{11]in 2007 hurricane felix rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a category 5 hurricane in 51 hours with a wind speed rise of 85knots98xc2xa0mph in just 24 hours{12]2008's hurricane ike with the hurricane undergoing a 24 millibar pressure drop in 3 hoursin 2010 there were multiple occurrences igor julia earl danielle and karl are prime examples each intensified from a minimal hurricane into a category 4 (category 3 for karl)in 2013 typhoon usagi underwent a 55 mb drop as it had intensified from a category 1 to a category 4 super typhoon in just 24 hours typhoon lekima rapidly intensified from a category 1 to category 5 in 24 hours and most notably typhoon haiyan deepened from 35 mb within 12 hours and 965 mb to 895 mb within a dayin 2014 cyclones gillian and hellen underwent rapid intensification going from tropical storms to category 5 cyclones in less than 48 hrs barely a week aparta few instances have been recorded in the north indian ocean such as the 1999 odisha cyclone the strongest storm on record in the basin undergoing a 28 millibar pressure drop in 6 hours and cyclone giri undergoing 24 millibar drop in 6 hours{13]in may 2014 hurricane amanda rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a categoryxc2xa04 in 24xc2xa0hours over the span of 30xc2xa0hours its central pressure decreased by 62xc2xa0mbar (hpa;
