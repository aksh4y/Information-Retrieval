seasontropical storm erika of august 2015 was the deadliest natural disaster in dominica since hurricane david in 1979 the fifth named storm of the season erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the lesser antilles hostile conditions including dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development and erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the leeward islands and emerged over the caribbean sea on augustxc2xa027 erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the dominican republic the remnant system persisted for several more days ultimately moving across the gulf of mexico before dissipating over georgia on septemberxc2xa02several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of erika especially dominica the storm's asymmetric structure coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft led to rainfall accumulations up to 33xc2xa0in (850xc2xa0mm) with grounds already saturated from antecedent rains tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods accompanying mudslides worsened the situation temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced; the entire town of petite savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm all told 30xc2xa0people died across the island in the nation's worst disaster since hurricane david the storm's devastating effects in dominica prompted an influx of international assistance aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired including 500xe2x80x931000 for the relocation of all of petite savanne's residentsin guadeloupe heavy rainfall in the vicinity of basse-terre caused flooding and mudslides forcing roads to temporarily close approximately 250000xc2xa0people in puerto rico were left without electricity the island experienced us1737xc2xa0million{nb 1] in agricultural damage in the dominican republic a weather station in barahona measured 2426xc2xa0in (616xc2xa0mm) of rain including 88xc2xa0in (220xc2xa0mm) in a single hour about 823xc2xa0homes suffered damage and 7345 people were displaced five people died in haiti four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide total damage from erika is estimated to be over us500xc2xa0million with us4828xc2xa0million in dominica alone owing to the disastrous effects on dominica the name erika was retired in the spring of 2016 and will never again be used for an atlantic tropical cyclone it will be replaced with elsa for the 2021 atlantic hurricane season{1]contents1 meteorological history2 preparations21

history{edit]map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirxe2x80x93simpson scaleon augustxc2xa020 2015 the national hurricane center (nhc) began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa near the atlantic shore{2] the disorganized system emerged over the atlantic ocean several hundred miles southeast of the cape verde islands the following day{3]{4] moving quickly west the system bypassed the cape verde islands to the south on augustxc2xa022{5] but remained largely disorganized a sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on augustxc2xa023 though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate{3] organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis{6] the trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00xc2xa0utc the formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly the system was classified as tropical storm erika the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season upon its designation erika was situated roughly 1035xc2xa0mi (1665xc2xa0km) east of the lesser antilles{3] the storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory steered by a subtropical ridge to the north{3]{7]at the time of erika's classification forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of erika statistical guidance and the hwrf depicted a hurricane while the ecmwf and gfs showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear the models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course accordingly the nhc noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for erika{7] this uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones but roughly average for weak poorly organized systems{8] throughout augustxc2xa025 and into early augustxc2xa026 the convective organization of erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection{9] early on augustxc2xa027 erika managed to intensify slightly attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) and a barometric pressure of 1001xc2xa0mbar (hpa; 2956xc2xa0inhg){3] around 09:00xc2xa0utc the disorganized center of erika passed over the northern tip of guadeloupe before emerging over the eastern caribbean sea{3]official forecast positions (top left) and various forecast models for erika versus its best track positions (black lines) note the consistent northerly bias present in all outputsconvection remained poorly organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone as it traversed the eastern caribbean sea{10] multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of augustxc2xa027xe2x80x9328 all rotating around a broad general center one such center moved over st croix and produced gale-force gusts environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile and forecasters at the nhc continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts{11] further structural degradation ensued on augustxc2xa028 as erika approached the dominican republic based on data from hurricane hunters erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressurexe2x80x94no longer meeting the definition of a tropical cyclonexe2x80x94shortly after 12:00xc2xa0utc near the southeastern coast of the dominican republic{3] operationally the nhc maintained advisories on erika until 13:30xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa029{12] it was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system{13]around 21:00xc2xa0utc on augustxc2xa028 the remnants of erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the dominican republic{14] the disheveled system emerged over the windward passage early on augustxc2xa029{13] thereafter the system skirted the northern coast of cuba and entered the gulf of mexico on augustxc2xa031 turning northward the disturbance eventually crossed northern florida on septemberxc2xa02 before dissipating over georgia the following day{3]preparations{edit]the nhc's forecast track for tropical storm erika at

entirety of the florida peninsulacaribbean{edit]various local governments issued tropical storm watches and warnings for their respective nations throughout the duration of erika watches and warnings covered the lesser antilles from guadeloupe northward almost the entirety of the greater antilles and the bahamas{3] the red cross opened four shelters to the public across the united states virgin islands{15] the local health department also opened special needs shelters on st croix and st thomas all non-essential government personnel were given administrative leave on augustxc2xa027 owing to rough seas local ports temporarily closed although airports remained open several airlines cancelled flights{16] a territory-wide curfew was imposed until the afternoon of augustxc2xa028{17]schools ports and beaches were closed across the dominican republic{18] the army of the dominican republic deployed 275xc2xa0soldiers and alongside the nation's air force assisted with the evacuation of residents the navy was placed on standby for potential search and rescue operations{19] officials in haiti suspended air service banned highway travel between departments and ordered small watercraft to remain at port{20] evacuation shelters were opened across all departments and 254xc2xa0prisoners were relocated from gonaxc3xafves to three other facilities{21]florida{edit]on augustxc2xa028 florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency{22] despite the storm dissipating shortly thereafter scott kept the emergency declaration in place and stated "this storm has been completely unpredictable the whole timewe will still get a lot of rain and a lot of flooding"{23] thirty members of the florida national guard were positioned while another 8000 were placed on standby{23] a collective 17xc2xa0flights were cancelled at miami international airport and fort lauderdalexe2x80x93hollywood international airport on augustxc2xa028{24] schools in hendry county preemptively closed for augustxc2xa031{23] with officials citing flooding concerns{25] sandbags were distributed to residents in doral hallandale beach hollywood and sweetwater{26] the last hurricane to impact the state was hurricane wilma in 2005 since that time the state's population grew by 2xc2xa0million with many presumed to have never experienced a hurricane before{23] some newer residents remained apathetic over the storm dismissing it as "another excuse to skip work or school or to party"{27]impact{edit]impact by country or regioncountyregiondeathsdamage

(62xc2xa0mph) on la dxc3xa9sirade some landslides and flooding were reported with roads in basse-terre temporarily closed xc3x89lectricitxc3xa9 de france reported that 1600xc2xa0customers lost power during the storm{34] rough seas in martinique grounded boats{35] landslides and felled trees blocked several roadways across the island{36] elsewhere in the lesser antilles effects from erika were negligible{37]the outer bands of erika brought much needed rain drought-stricken puerto rico;{17] a station in adjuntas recorded 445xc2xa0in (113xc2xa0mm) of rain{3] tropical storm-force wind gusts peaking at 59xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) in maricao{3] caused substantial disruption to the power grid leaving approximately 250000xc2xa0people without electricity{38] thirty-six homes sustained roof damage across interior locations of the territory and agriculture sustained us1737xc2xa0million in damage{32]rainfall from the remnants of erika across the southeastern united statesa weather station in barahona dominican republic measured 2426xc2xa0in (616xc2xa0mm) of rain during erika's passage including 88xc2xa0in (220xc2xa0mm) in a single hour surrounding areas reported significantly less rain however{39] throughout the country 823xc2xa0homes suffered damage and 7345xc2xa0people were displaced erika blocked over 400 roads and left many power outages{40] winds gusts of 50xc2xa0mph (85xc2xa0kmh) in azua caused at least 400xc2xa0million dop (us888xc2xa0million) in damage to the banana crop{30] heavy rains also impacted haiti which was still recovering from a catastrophic earthquake in 2010; an estimated 60000xc2xa0people remained in emergency housing{18] four persons died and eleven others were hospitalized in lxc3xa9ogxc3xa2ne when a truck crashed into a bus on rain-slicked roads and exploded{31] a fifth death occurred during a landslide in port-au-prince two people in the area were injured after a house collapsed{18]the remnants of erika later brought much needed rains to cuba which was suffering from its worst drought since 1901{18]united states{edit]later erika's remnants dropped locally heavy rainfall across florida particularly in the miami metropolitan area a station northwest of sweetwater observed 9xc2xa0in (230xc2xa0mm) of rain{41] minor flash flooding left streets in wynwood impassable{42] farther north in flagler county scattered thunderstorms produced isolated instances of heavy rain; 22xc2xa0in (56xc2xa0mm) fell within one hour in palm coast{43] in the greater jacksonville area lightning struck the sally b mathis elementary school resulting in damage to the air conditioning unit and evacuation of students{44] in neighboring georgia moisture from erika's remnants fueled scattered severe thunderstorms large hail caused us23xc2xa0million in damage near woodstock{33] strong winds gusting up to 60xc2xa0mph (95xc2xa0kmh) accompanied these storms downing trees and power lines in cherokee polk and troup counties{45]{46]{47] additional rainfall extended north through the carolinas{41]effects in dominica{edit]the rugged terrain of dominica makes it prone to landslides in heavy rain events the town of petite savanne (pictured) situated on steep cliffs was rendered uninhabitable after numerous landslides devastated the areaalthough erika passed to the north of dominica as a weak tropical storm torrential rains associated with the storm impacted the country{3] unusually high precipitable water values of 26xc2xa0in (67xc2xa0mm) were present over the island as erika moved through orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of erika continued west more than 8xc2xa0in (200xc2xa0mm) of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48xc2xa0hours with an island-wide average of 24xc2xa0in (610xc2xa0mm){nb 2] during the period of heaviest rain average rainfall across the entire island exceeded 35xc2xa0in (90xc2xa0mm) per hour rates along the macoucherie river reached 11xc2xa0in (270xc2xa0mm) per hour the heaviest rain was concentrated around the nation's tallest mountain morne diablotins where an estimated 31 to 33xc2xa0in (800 to 850xc2xa0mm) fell rainfall across morne diablotin national park generally exceeded 24xc2xa0in (600xc2xa0mm) a secondary peak accumulation of 26 to 28xc2xa0in (650 to 700xc2xa0mm) occurred in the southeastern part of the island around morne trois pitons{48] observed accumulations include 17xc2xa0in (430xc2xa0mm) at gleau gommier{49] 1262xc2xa0in (321xc2xa0mm) at canefield airport and 874xc2xa0in (222xc2xa0mm) at douglasxe2x80x93charles airport{3] with grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to erika much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface; in multiple watersheds runoff exceeded 60xc2xa0percent of accumulations{48]catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island{3] resulting in dominica's worst natural disaster since hurricane david in 1979{50]{51] across the island's rugged terrain the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water these earthen dams subsequently collapsed leading to amplified flooding downstream flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by international commission on large dams modeling a post-storm study of 16xc2xa0rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1000xc2xa0m3s along 5 rivers with a maximum of 2876xc2xa0m3s along the malabuka river{48]nearly 17000 of the nation's 71293xc2xa0people were severely impacted by the storm{52] a total of 30xc2xa0people were killed{3] 20xc2xa0others were injured and 574xc2xa0people were left homeless{28]{29] more than 890xc2xa0homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable{53] infrastructure suffered tremendous damage: 6xc2xa0percent of bridges and 17xc2xa0percent of roads were wiped out furthermore half of the nation's bridges and a quarter of its roads were damaged{54] total losses amounted to ec13xc2xa0billion (us4828xc2xa0million) roughly 90xc2xa0percent of dominica's gross domestic product{29] dominica prime minister roosevelt skerrit stated in a national announcement on augustxc2xa028 that "the visual damage i saw today i fear may have set our development process back by 20 years"{20]flooding crippled transportation and communication with eight bridges severely damaged or destroyed leaving many areas of the island isolated{29]{55] boetica and delices remained cut-off by ground for more than three weeks{56] more than 12xc2xa0major rivers topped their banks{57] approximately 45xc2xa0percent of residents lost electricity{55] and almost the entirety of the water supply network was damaged{29] additionally 50xc2xa0percent of telephone service was lost{55] both canefield and douglasxe2x80x93charles airports were flooded with water rising above a small airplane at the latter{58] douglasxe2x80x93charles airport sustained more than ec395xc2xa0million (us146xc2xa0million) in damage and was closed until septemberxc2xa018{59]{60] the main river running through roseau the nation's capital burst its banks during the overnight of augustxc2xa026xe2x80x9327 flooding surrounding areas{61] one person was killed during a mudslide and one building collapsed in the city{58]{62]the small community of petite savanne was virtually destroyed with 217xc2xa0homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate{63]{64] twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to erika in dominica{3]{65] residents dug through mud and debris often with their bare hands to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse{57] the village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrived{66]local response{edit]immediately following erika's devastating impact in dominica on augustxc2xa027 the organisation of eastern caribbean states convened to determine an assessment plan{67] the government of dominica declared nine areas special disaster areas: petite savanne pichelin good hope bath estate dubique campbell coulibistrie san sauveur and petite soufriere{68] the national emergency operations centre was activated and worked in conjunction with various local agencies to conduct relief missions approximately 100xc2xa0personnel were deployed for various relief measures including search and rescue{69] the dominica spa health and wellness association worked in conjunction with the trinidad-based centre for human development to provide psychological support to victims;{70] eight trauma specialists were sent to dominica{71]the psychiatric unit of princess margaret hospital conducted field assessments and provided emotional support to residents in a report on septemberxc2xa018 they noted that residents in coulibistrie remained in a state of shock for weeks after erika with many struggling to begin the recovery process{72] the ministry of health highlighted concerns over post-storm diseases particularly from mosquitoes due to a major increase in the usage of water storage containers{73] an outbreak of gastroenteritis ensued in the weeks following erika with 153xc2xa0cases confirmed by septemberxc2xa022 cases were primarily in portsmouth saint joseph and roseau{74]a unique means of supplying food and water the communities of boetica and delices only accessible by air due to a gorge 260xc2xa0ft (80xc2xa0m) wide and 200xc2xa0ft (61xc2xa0m) deep was established in the form of a zip-line in late-september this served as the primary means of aid until a 98xc2xa0ft (30xc2xa0m) bailey bridge was constructed{75] by aprilxc2xa02016 the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation projects reached ec7xc2xa0million (us3xc2xa0million){76] supplementing reconstruction efforts by china and the united kingdom the nation's government allocated a further ec30xc2xa0million (us11xc2xa0million) to enhancing road safety{77] the food and agriculture organization allocated ec300000 (us110000) for farmers in october{78] through junexc2xa02016 the government provided victims with ec5xe2x80x936xc2xa0million (us18xe2x80x9322xc2xa0million) primarily to cover shelters and food{79]international assistance{edit]rfaxc2xa0lyme bay provided vital assistance to many isolated communities in early septemberwithin 48xc2xa0hours of the storm governments of canada france the united kingdom the united states the european union and various intergovernmental organizations under the united nationsxe2x80x94such as the pan american health organization (paho) unicef and united nations development programmexe2x80x94pledged aid; antigua and barbuda barbados montserrat saint lucia and trinidad and tobago provided support teamsxe2x80x94firefighters police search and rescue and military personnelxe2x80x94and established supply routes with dominica{37] the caribbean disaster emergency management agency (cdema) pledged assistance to dominica offering two helicopters with supplies and medics from trinidad{17] support teams from the cdema arrived in dominica on augustxc2xa028{37] the regional security system deployed 83xc2xa0personnel whom conducted search and rescue operations and assisted in the evacuation of hundreds of residents{80] china and the caribbean development bank offered us300000 and us200000 in aid respectively to the nation{81]{82] china later provided an additional us200000 in october{83] the government of venezuela airlifted 2000xc2xa0tons of food and supplies to dominica and pledged to provide a helicopter carrier ship on augustxc2xa029{84] supplies from venezuela were bolstered to 10xc2xa0tons by septemberxc2xa01 and the ship pdv marina was deployed that day with an additional 13xc2xa0tons worth fuel machinery and other supplies{85]further assistance was provided by the governments of cuba grenada and st kitts and nevis by augustxc2xa031{86]{87] the latter of which donated ec1xc2xa0million (us368000){88] the british-flagged rfaxc2xa0lyme bay arrived in dominica on septemberxc2xa02 carrying medical supplies marines{63] and a lynx mk8 helicopter{89] the helicopter flew 25xc2xa0flights over a period of five days to isolated communities providing them with 2xc2xa0tonnes of supplies daily more than 20xc2xa0tonnes of water and 53xc2xa0tonnes of food were provided by rfa lyme bay{90] the governments of the british virgin islands and taiwan each pledged us100000 in funds{91]{92] digicel and lime coordinated restoration efforts to the nation's fiber-optic networks{93] the former requested donations from 32xc2xa0countries while the latter assisted in establishing supply routes to isolated communities{94] digical also partnered with the dominican red cross paying for transportation so relief teams could access isolated towns{95]brazil provided medical supplies (pictured) in octoberxc2xa02015 to the disaster-struck nationthe government of the cayman islands donated us500000 and requested residents of the territory to donate supplies{96] japan's government provided us100000-worth of generators water purifiers and water tanks through the japan international cooperation agency{97] a further tt5xc2xa0million (us784000) was provided by trinidad and tobago{98] the government of guyana provided a shipment of 68xc2xa0tonnes of rice collected through public and private donations three times more than targeted{99] through its excess rainfall programme the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility provided xe2x82xac65xc2xa0million (us24xc2xa0million) to the government of dominicaxe2x80x94the maximum payout allowable{100] thousands of school supplies including books and writing utensils were collected by the caribbean community{101] the adventist development and relief agency (adra) all hands volunteers convoy of hope childfund and the organization of american states also provided assistance{102]the initial response from unicef included the distribution of over 600xc2xa0hygiene kits and 4000xc2xa0water purification tablets{52] logistical support namely satellite phones solar chargers and laptops were provided by the international telecommunication union{103] four tonnes of medical supplies provided by the paho arrived on septemberxc2xa09{104] and the government of brazil supplied additional medical items in october{105] after an initial release of funds on septemberxc2xa03 the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc) launched an emergency appeal on septemberxc2xa010 for approximately us1xc2xa0million to assist 12000xc2xa0people{106] the society's relief operation lasted until aprilxc2xa010 2016 and provided 12382xc2xa0people with life-saving assistance the ifrc's primary goal was to restore access to clean water; more than half a million litres of water was provided during the seven-month operation in regards to health psychosocial support was made available to 873xc2xa0people roughly half of the original goal hygiene awareness and distribution of kits proved successful with all 1000xc2xa0kits supplied to those in need the dominican red cross mass-promoted the red cross first aid mobile app to 8000xc2xa0phones though only 399 people downloaded it cash grants of us334xe2x80x94by way of visa debit cardsxe2x80x94were provided to 279xc2xa0families to cover lost property a total of 1000xc2xa0mattresses were provided to survivors and a request for additional beds was made; however limited funds prevented fulfillment{107]in marchxc2xa02017 the cdema approved a xe2x82xac96xc2xa0million (us105xc2xa0million) plan to address gaps in dominica's disaster response legislation uncovered during the response to erika{108]reconstruction{edit]the destruction of petite savanne forced the evacuation of 823xc2xa0people; the village was later deemed uninhabitable and a new town needed to be built elsewhere{109] many were temporarily relocated to the dominica grammar school in roseau; however members of the public looked upon the evacuees with scorn and insulted them for disrupting their daily lives parliamentary representative kenneth darroux pleaded with residents to be understanding and patient with those whom were displaced{110] plans for a new settlement were established in februaryxc2xa02016 with plans to build 500xe2x80x931000xc2xa0homes similarly all residents of dubique were forced to evacuate; they were relocated to temporary homes in grand bay provided by venezuela{109] ten two- and three-bedroom homes were provided by the adra costs for resettlement and reconstruction exceeded ec91xc2xa0million (us143xc2xa0million){111] power was restored to all areas of the nation except for petite savanne and dubique by septemberxc2xa028{112] restoration to the nation's water system was completed in januaryxc2xa02016; however permanent systems were still to be constructed{113]french organizations provided xe2x82xac70000 (us77000) for the reconstruction of two schools{114] repair of douglasxe2x80x93charles airport was deemed a priority though the first phase of rehabilitation for runways and aprons took more than a year to complete in addition to repairs greater flood defense systems were implemented including dredging flood walls and river training{115] construction of 25xc2xa0planned homes by the adra began in februaryxc2xa02016 with projected completion in 2017; 50xc2xa0volunteers were involved in the project{116] in novemberxc2xa02016 dominica signed an agreement with the european union for an xe2x82xac89xc2xa0million (us96xc2xa0million) rehabilitation project{117] in a join dominicaxe2x80x93united kingdom project a new road from loubiere to bagatelle in southeastern dominica was announced in marchxc2xa02017 the ec100xc2xa0million (us37xc2xa0million) plan would ensure the road could handle heavy rain events with 12xe2x80x9314xc2xa0culverts and 3xc2xa0bridges furthermore road
