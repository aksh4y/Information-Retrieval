b'advection - wikipedia advectionfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediajump to:navigation searchin physics engineering and earth sciences advection is the transport of a substance by bulk motion the properties of that substance are carried with it generally the majority of the advected substance is a fluid the properties that are carried with the advected substance are conserved properties such as energy an example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river by bulk water flow downstream another commonly advected quantity is energy or enthalpy here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy such as water or air in general any substance or conserved extensive quantity can be advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substanceduring advection a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion the fluid's motion is described mathematically as a vector field and the transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution over space advection requires currents in the fluid and so cannot happen in rigid solids it does not include transport of substances by molecular diffusionadvection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of convection which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transportin meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity (see moisture) or salinity advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cyclecontents1 distinction between advection and convection2 meteorology3 other quantities4 mathematics of advection41 the advection equation42 solving

serves as a synonym for convection but technically convection covers the sum of transport both by diffusion and by advection advective transport describes the movement of some quantity via the bulk flow of a fluid (as in a river or pipeline){1]{2]meteorology{edit]in meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity or salinity and convection generally refers to vertical transport (vertical advection) advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds (terrain-forced convection) and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cycleother quantities{edit]the advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a probability density function at each point although accounting for diffusion is more difficult{citation needed]mathematics of advection{edit]the advection equation is the partial differential equation that governs the motion of a conserved scalar field as it is advected by a known velocity vector field it is derived using the scalar field's conservation law together with gauss's theorem and taking the infinitesimal limitone easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river as the river flows ink will move downstream in a "pulse" via advection as the water's movement itself transports the ink if added to a lake without significant bulk water flow the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a diffusive manner which is not advection note that as it moves downstream the "pulse" of ink will also spread via diffusion the sum of these processes is called convectionthe advection equation{edit]in cartesian coordinates the advection operator isuxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87=uxxe2x88x82xe2x88x82x+uyxe2x88x82xe2x88x82y+uzxe2x88x82xe2x88x82z{displaystyle mathbf {u} cdot abla =u_{x}{frac {partial }{partial x}}+u_{y}{frac {partial }{partial y}}+u_{z}{frac {partial }{partial z}}}where u=(uxuyuz){displaystyle mathbf {u} =(u_{x}u_{y}u_{z})} is the velocity field and xe2x88x87{displaystyle abla } is the del operator (note that cartesian coordinates are used here)the advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a scalar field xcfx88{displaystyle psi } is expressed mathematically by a continuity equation:xe2x88x82xcfx88xe2x88x82t+xe2x88x87xe2x8bx85(xcfx88u)=0{displaystyle {frac {partial psi }{partial t}}+abla cdot left(psi {mathbf {u}}right)=0}where xe2x88x87xe2x8bx85{displaystyle abla cdot } is the divergence operator and again u{displaystyle mathbf {u} } is the velocity vector field frequently it is assumed that the flow is incompressible that is the velocity field satisfiesxe2x88x87xe2x8bx85u=0{displaystyle abla cdot {mathbf {u}}=0}and u{displaystyle mathbf {u} } is said to be solenoidal if this is so the above equation can be rewritten asxe2x88x82xcfx88xe2x88x82t+uxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87xcfx88=0{displaystyle {frac {partial psi }{partial t}}+{mathbf {u}}cdot abla psi =0}in particular if the flow is steady thenuxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87xcfx88=0{displaystyle {mathbf {u}}cdot abla psi =0}which shows that xcfx88{displaystyle psi } is constant along a streamline hence xe2x88x82xcfx88xe2x88x82t=0{displaystyle partial psi partial t=0} so xcfx88{displaystyle psi } doesn't vary in timeif a vector quantity a{displaystyle mathbf {a} } (such as a magnetic field) is being advected by the solenoidal velocity field u{displaystyle mathbf {u} } the advection equation above becomes:xe2x88x82axe2x88x82t+(uxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87)a=0{displaystyle {frac {partial {mathbf {a}}}{partial t}}+left({mathbf {u}}cdot abla right){mathbf {a}}=0}here a{displaystyle mathbf {a} } is a vector field instead of the scalar field xcfx88{displaystyle psi }solving the equation{edit]a simulation of the advection equation where u = (sin t cos t) is solenoidalthe advection equation is not simple to solve numerically: the system is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and interest typically centers on discontinuous "shock" solutions (which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle)even with one space dimension and a constant velocity field the system remains difficult to simulate the equation becomesxe2x88x82xcfx88xe2x88x82t+uxxe2x88x82xcfx88xe2x88x82x=0{displaystyle {frac {partial psi }{partial t}}+u_{x}{frac {partial psi }{partial x}}=0}where xcfx88=xcfx88(xt){displaystyle psi =psi (xt)} is the scalar field being advected and ux{displaystyle u_{x}} is the x{displaystyle x} component of the vector u=(ux00){displaystyle mathbf {u} =(u_{x}00)}treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible navier stokes equations{edit]according to zang{3] numerical simulation can be aided by considering the skew symmetric form for the advection operator12uxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87u+12xe2x88x87(uu){displaystyle {frac {1}{2}}{mathbf {u}}cdot abla {mathbf {u}}+{frac {1}{2}}abla ({mathbf {u}}{mathbf {u}})}wherexe2x88x87(uu)={xe2x88x87(uux)xe2x88x87(uuy)xe2x88x87(uuz)]{displaystyle abla ({mathbf {u}}{mathbf {u}})={abla ({mathbf {u}}u_{x})abla ({mathbf {u}}u_{y})abla ({mathbf {u}}u_{z})]}and u{displaystyle mathbf {u} } is the same as abovesince skew symmetry implies only imaginary eigenvalues this form reduces the "blow up" and "spectral blocking" often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities (see boyd{4])using vector calculus identities these operators can also be expressed in other ways available in more software packages for more coordinate systemsuxe2x8bx85xe2x88x87u=xe2x88x87(xe2x88xa5uxe2x88xa522)+(xe2x88x87xc3x97u)xc3x97u{displaystyle mathbf {u} cdot abla mathbf {u} =abla left({frac {mathbf {u} ^{2}}{2}}right)+left(abla imes mathbf

form also makes visible that the skew symmetric operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large
