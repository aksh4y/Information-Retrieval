### Running the program ###

Step 1) Find a machine with Python 3
Step 2) Run the program using the python (python, python3, py <- depending on environment setup) command followed by pageRank.py
Step 3) Wait for the page rank algorithm to do the work. 
Step 4) Find the relevant source files and URL list file called __Perplexity.txt and __PRscore.txt in the same directory as the program
